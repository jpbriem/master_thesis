prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0]]
output: [[6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 4]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [0, 5, 5, 0]]
output: [[4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [9, 9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'The top-left and bottom-right corners move diagonally towards each other while preserving their respective colors.', 'object_changes': 'No new objects are created, but existing ones change positions.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'The middle column moves leftwards, creating space for the rightmost column to shift one position to the left.', 'object_changes': 'No new objects are created, but existing ones change positions.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'The left half of the second row shifts upwards, merging with the third row, while the right half remains unchanged.', 'object_changes': 'No new objects are created, but existing ones change positions.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Each input/output pair shares the common theme of moving colored blocks (objects) around while maintaining their original sizes and colors. This movement causes the grid to transform without introducing any new objects or changing the existing ones.', 'instructions': 'For each input grid, perform the following steps:

1. Identify the four distinct colors present in the grid.
2. For each color, find the connected group of pixels having that color (an object).
3. Shift these objects according to the specific transformation pattern observed in the given examples.
4. Replace the original objects' locations with zeros.

In this particular test case, follow these detailed steps:
1. Identify the colors: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.
2. Find the objects:
   - Color 4: coordinates = [(1, 1), (1, 2)]
   - Color 6: coordinates = [(2, 2)]
   - Color 7: coordinates = [(2, 3), (2, 4)]
   - Color 8: coordinates = [(4, 1), (4, 2)]
   - Color 9: coordinates = [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)]
3. Shift the objects according to the pattern:
   - Color 4: Move two spaces to the right and one space downwards.
     New coordinates: [(2, 1), (2, 2)]
   - Color 6: Move three spaces to the right.
     New coordinates: [(3, 2)]
   - Color 7: Stay in the same position.
     New coordinates: [(2, 3), (2, 4)]
   - Color 8: Stay in the same position.
     New coordinates: [(4, 1), (4, 2)]
   - Color 9: Move one space to the left and two spaces upwards.
     New coordinates: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)]
4. Replace the original objects' locations with zeros.

After performing these steps, we get the following result:', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [9, 9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'A grid of dimensions 5x5, with the following patterns:
