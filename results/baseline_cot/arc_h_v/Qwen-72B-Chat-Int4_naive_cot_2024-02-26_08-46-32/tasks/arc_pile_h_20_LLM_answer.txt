prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 9, 9, 9]]
output: [[7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4]]
output: [[8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [4, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 2], [5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
```json
{
    "<example_1_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input grid has four non-zero-color regions (objects) that are moved or removed entirely in the output grid. Specifically, Object_1 (color 7) moves two steps right and disappears; Object_2 (color 2) splits into two parts, each shifted one step left horizontally; Object_3 (color 9) expands one step vertically while maintaining the original width.",
        "object_changes": "Regarding the objects, there's a change in both their sizes and coordinates. Object_1 vanishes after moving rightward. Object_2 splits into two smaller ones. Object_3 grows upward."

    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example shows an input grid where some regions (objects) are present in the corners and sides, but they are not modified in any way except for a shift towards the center of the grid in the output. In particular, Object_1 (color 4) contracts along the horizontal axis, losing one column.",
        "object_changes": "The main difference lies in the decrease in size of Object_1. It shrinks horizontally without changing position."
    },
    "<example_3_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "The input grid features several regions (objects), most of which move slightly in the output grid. For instance, Object_1 (color 8) shifts one step left and loses one row; Object_2 (color 2) becomes disconnected and moves one step left; Object_4 (color 4) also separates into two separate pieces and moves one step left. Only Object_3 remains unchanged.",
        "object_changes": "In terms of objects, we observe variations in their sizes, positions, and connectivity. Object_1 reduces in height, and its top part slides to the left. Object_2 splits apart and shifts to the left. Object_4 divides and migrates to the left as well."
    },
    "<overall_pattern>": "The common theme among these input-output pairs seems to involve shifting or resizing the colored regions (objects) according to certain rules. Some objects may split or merge during the process. However, no new objects appear out of nowhere or disappear completely.",

Object_3 is located in the middle row and takes up dimensions 1x1. Object_4 fills two diagonal cells and measures 2x2. Lastly, Object_5 and Object_6 are identical rectangles measuring 1x1.",
    "<test_case_transformation>": "To obtain the output grid, perform the following operations:

1. Move Object_1 one step downward and maintain its original width.
2. Resize Object_2 so that it takes up two rows instead of one and shift it one step left.
3. Keep Object_3 unmodified.
4. Merge Object_4 and Object_5 together, forming a larger square of size 2x2, centered in the bottom-right corner.
5. Remove Object_6 altogether.

After applying these transformations, update the output grid accordingly.",
