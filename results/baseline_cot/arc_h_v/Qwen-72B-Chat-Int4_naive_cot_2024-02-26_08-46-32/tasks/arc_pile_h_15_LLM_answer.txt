prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [7, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 4, 4, 4], [3, 3, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 5]]
output: [[4, 4, 4, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]
output: [[9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
```json
{
    "<example_1_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input grid has black (value 0) and colored pixels (values 1 to 9). The output grid removes some of these colored pixels, creating white spaces where they used to be.",
        "object_changes": "There are no objects in the input grid because there are no connected pixels of the same value. However, after removing certain pixels in the output grid, we obtain three distinct regions: one filled with color 6, another with color 5, and a third with color 7."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example shows that the transformation involves keeping only the pixels along the edges of the input grid. All interior pixels are removed, leaving behind an outline of the original shape.",
        "object_changes": "The input grid contains four separate objects, but the output grid reduces them to two. One object consists of color 3 and the other combines the remaining colors 4, 5, and 6."
    },
    "<example_3_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input grid has several colored regions separated by black boundaries. In the output grid, each region expands horizontally until it touches the boundary of the grid or encounters another region. White space separates these expanded regions.",
        "object_changes": "There are six objects in the input grid, but the output grid merges them into just three larger ones. Each of these new objects occupies the full width of the grid row in which it appears."
    },
    "<overall_pattern>": "Given an input grid composed of variously colored pixels, the transformation creates a new output grid where each row retains only the outermost columns of the same-colored pixels found in the corresponding row of the input grid. This results in a reduced-size representation of the original image while preserving its general structure.",
    "<instructions>": [
        "For each row of the input grid:",
        "1. Identify the leftmost column having non-zero pixel values.",
        "2. Find the rightmost column having non-zero pixel values.",
        "3. Keep only those columns identified in steps 1 and 2, discarding any intermediate columns.",
        "4. Repeat the process for the next row, considering the modified grid obtained in the previous iteration.",

    "<test_case_grid_view>": "The test input grid features five rows and five columns. It includes black (value 0), colored pixels (values 1 to 9), and empty cells (value 0). There are multiple disconnected regions of colored pixels.",
