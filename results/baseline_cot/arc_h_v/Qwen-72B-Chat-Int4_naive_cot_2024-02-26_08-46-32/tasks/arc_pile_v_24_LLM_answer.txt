prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 1, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 3], [4, 0, 8, 3], [0, 1, 8, 3]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 3], [4, 1, 8, 3], [4, 1, 8, 3]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7], [0, 8, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 8, 0, 3, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7], [0, 8, 0, 3, 7], [0, 8, 0, 3, 7]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 0, 7], [2, 6, 0, 0, 7], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 7], [2, 6, 0, 0, 7]]



Test case:
input: [[2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
```json
{
    "<example_1_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the transformation involves changing some of the input pixels to zeros while preserving certain structures. Specifically, the top-left corner of each object (except the bottom-right one) becomes zero, and any other pixels that were touching these corners also become zero.",
        "object_changes": "There's no change in terms of colors, but there's a decrease in size and/or coordinates adjustment for some objects. In particular, Object_1 loses two pixels, and Object_2 shifts slightly to the right."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example shows an even more aggressive transformation where most of the input pixels become zero. Only those in specific locations remain unchanged. Some pixels near the edges of the original objects are preserved.",
        "object_changes": "Objects disappear or merge together due to the extensive zero-clearing process. Object_1 disappears entirely, whereas Object_2 combines with Object_4 to form a new object with the same color and position as Object_2 in the input."
    },
    "<example_3_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "Similar to the previous examples, some input pixels turn into zeros, leaving behind only selected ones. However, unlike the others, here we see that instead of just clearing out parts of existing objects, some input pixels are transformed to match the colors of nearby objects.",
        "object_changes": "Two new objects appear as a result of merging existing ones. One is created by merging Object_1 and Object_2, and another forms when Object_4 absorbs Object_5. There's no significant change in terms of colors or sizes."
    },
    "<overall_pattern>": "A common thread among these examples is the selective removal of input pixels and modification of their neighboring pixels to create distinct outputs. This could involve transforming individual pixels or groups of them based on their adjacency or proximity to certain features.",
    "<instructions>": [
        "Step 1: Identify regions or clusters of input pixels that will be cleared or modified.",
        "Step 2: Apply transformations to the remaining pixels, potentially adjusting their colors or positions.",
        "Step 3: Merge or split objects according to the specified rules."
    ],
    "<test_case_input_copy>": "[[2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]",
    "<test_case_grid_view>": "The test input grid consists of six rows and five columns. It contains various colored pixels arranged in a non-uniform manner. There are several disconnected objects scattered throughout the grid.",
    "<test_case_object_view>": "There are multiple objects present in the test input grid. Object_1 has color '2' and occupies the top row and column; Object_2 has color '9' and appears in the second row and third column; Object_3 has color '1' and exists in the fourth row and fifth column; Object_4 has color '5' and covers the fifth row and sixth column; Object_5 has color '4' and resides in the fifth row and third column; Object_6 has color '8' and appears in the last row and sixth column.",
    "<test_case_transformation>": "To transform the test input grid, follow these steps:

1. Clear the pixels located at the top-left corner of each object except Object_6.
2. Replace the pixels immediately below the top-left corner of Object_1 with zeros.
3. Shift Object_2 one cell to the left and remove its rightmost pixel.
4. Remove Object_3 completely.
5. Keep Object_4 intact.
6. Move Object_5 one cell to the left and merge it with Object_4.
7. Leave Object_6 untouched.

After applying these transformations, combine the modified and moved objects to create the final output grid.",
    "<test_case_output>": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]])
