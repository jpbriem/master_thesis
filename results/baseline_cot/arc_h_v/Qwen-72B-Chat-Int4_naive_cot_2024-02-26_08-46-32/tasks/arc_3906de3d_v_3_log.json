            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 9, 3, 9, 9, 3, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 3, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 9, 3, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 9, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 9, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define function to find connected components (objects) in a binary image\ndef label(image):\n    labels = np.zeros_like(image)\n    next_label = 1\n    \n    for i in range(image.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(image.shape[1]):\n            if image[i][j]:\n                #

The `label` function takes an image as input and returns a labeled image where each connected component (object) has a unique label. The `apply_rule` function applies a transformation rule to a given grid. It takes a grid and a rule dictionary as inputs and returns the modified grid. A rule dictionary contains a list of colors that trigger the rule, a list of actions to be performed (`remove`, `replace`) and, in case of replacement, a new color value.\nThe code also defines a list of transformation rules `rules` that will be applied to the input grid.\nFinally, the code reads the test case input grid, creates a copy of it, applies the transformation rules using the `apply_rule` function, and prints the resulting output grid.\nNote that this solution assumes that there are no overlapping objects in the input grid. If there are multiple objects touching each other, then the labeling function may assign the same label to multiple objects, leading to incorrect results. In such cases, a more sophisticated labeling algorithm that takes into account the connectivity of the objects would be needed."
