prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 3, 3, 3], [9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
output: [[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8]]
output: [[6, 6, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'The input grid has three distinct colored regions (colors 3, 9, and 2) separated by a border of zeros. In the output grid, each region retains its original color but shrinks to remove any borders touching other regions.', 'object_changes': 'There are four objects in the input grid: two large rectangles (one composed of color 3, one composed of color 9), and two small squares (both composed of color 2). In the output grid, there are still four objects; however, their sizes have changed due to shrinkage around their edges so that they no longer touch any neighboring objects.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In this example, the input grid contains six non-zero regions of various shapes and sizes arranged across multiple rows. The output grid maintains these regions while eliminating any shared boundaries. Each region is filled entirely with its own unique color without any mixing or overlap.', 'object_changes': 'There are seven objects present in the input grid, varying in size and color. After applying the transformation, we obtain six objects in the output grid. Some objects remain unchanged, whereas others change significantly in terms of color, size, and position. There is also an additional new object created due to separation from another existing object.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'The input grid consists of four separate regions, each containing a unique color (6, 1, 0, and 8). These regions are separated by a border of zeros. In the output grid, each region expands to fill the space previously occupied by the separating zeros, effectively merging them together.', 'object_changes': 'There were initially five distinct objects in the input grid: two large rectangles (comprising colors 6 and 1 respectively), a square (color 0), and two smaller rectangles (colors 8 and 0). However, after applying the transformation, the output grid shows just three objects - two merged rectangles (formed from colors 6 and 1), and two smaller rectangles (colors 8 and 0).'}, 'overall_pattern': 'A common thread among these examples is the removal of boundaries between regions sharing the same color value. This results in either expansion or contraction of the regions themselves, altering the overall structure of the grid. Additionally, some objects may merge or split depending on whether they share a common boundary before and after the transformation.', 'instructions': 'To apply the transformation described by these examples, follow these steps:

1. Identify all connected components (regions) in the input grid where adjacent cells have the same non-zero value.
2. For each component identified, modify its size by expanding or contracting it along the boundaries where it touches a cell of a different value or zero.
3. Apply these modifications simultaneously to all components, ensuring that the final result does not contain overlapping regions.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'The test input grid consists of six rows and six columns. It features several distinct regions of non-zero values, including two horizontal stripes of alternating colors (8 and 7), two vertical stripes of alternating colors (1 and 2), and two large blocks of colors 6 and 3 located at opposite corners of the grid. All these regions are separated by borders of zeros.', 'test_case_object_view': 'In the test input grid, there are eight distinct objects, ranging in size and color.

1. Merge the horizontally-striped objects (8 and 7) by removing the separating row of zeros between them.
2. Merge the vertically-striped objects (1 and 2) by removing the separating column of zeros between them.
3. Expand the top-left block of color 6 to cover the now-empty spaces left by the removed separators.
4. Contract the bottom-right block of color 3 to eliminate the overlapping area with the expanded color 6 block.', 'test_case_output': np.array([[0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]])}
