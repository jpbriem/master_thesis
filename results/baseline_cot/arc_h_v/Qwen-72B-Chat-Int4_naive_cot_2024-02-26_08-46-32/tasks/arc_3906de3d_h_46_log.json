            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nBased on the given examples, the overall pattern seems to involve transforming the input grid such that each group of connected pixels (objects) of the same value (except for zeros) gets replaced by a rectangle filled with that value's corners having the opposite corner's value. The rectangles' sizes match the original object's size but maintain their aspect ratio while fitting entirely within the bounding box defined by the object's outermost edges.\nFor example_1:\n\n  * Pixel Changes: In this example, there are two types of changes - replacing the center pixel of a square region of a certain color with another color, and filling the remaining area around the replaced pixel with the new color.\n  * Object Changes: There are four objects present in the input grid (two squares of color 2 and two rectangles of color 9). After applying the transformation, these objects change in various ways. One of the squares of color 2 shrinks and moves towards the top-left corner, losing its bottom-right pixel, while another square grows larger and fills the space left behind by the shrinking square. Additionally, the smaller rectangle of color 9 also loses its rightmost pixel.\n\nRegarding the other examples, they follow the same logic of transforming the input grid according to the described overall pattern.\nTherefore, the instructions for transforming the test case input would be as follows:\n\n  1. Identify all connected regions of non-zero pixels in the input grid.\n  2. For each identified region, determine its bounding box (the smallest rectangle enclosing all its pixels).\n  3. Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n  4. Iterate over each pixel in the input grid.\n    * If the pixel has a value of zero, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to zero.\n    * Otherwise, if the pixel belongs to an identified region, find the opposite corner of the bounding box and assign its value to the current pixel in the output grid. Also, fill the rest of the bounding box with the original pixel value.\n  5. Return the output grid.\n\nHere's the result of applying these steps to the test case input:\n```json\n{\n  \"<example_1_description>\": {\n    \"pixel_changes\": \"In this example, there are two types of changes - replacing the center pixel of a square region of a certain color with another color, and filling the remaining area around the replaced pixel with the new color.\",\n    \"object_changes\": \"There are four objects present in the input grid (two squares of color 2 and two rectangles of color 9).
