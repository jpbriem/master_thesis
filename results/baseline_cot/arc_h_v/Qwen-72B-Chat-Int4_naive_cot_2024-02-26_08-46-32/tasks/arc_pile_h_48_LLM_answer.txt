prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 1, 1, 1], [9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 1, 1, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[3, 0, 3, 3], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 4, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]]

Sample Outputs:
```json
{
    "<example_1_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input grid has four colored objects (colors 3, 4, 6, and 2) while the output grid contains three colored objects (colors 3, 4, and 6). In particular, two connected instances of color 3 in the top row become one large instance covering columns 1 through 3. Color 2's presence is removed entirely, and similarly, the smaller instance of color 4 disappears.",
        "object_changes": "There are fewer objects present in the output grid compared to the input grid. Specifically, there are no longer any instances of color 2, and the smaller instance of color 4 is gone. Additionally, the larger instance of color 3 expands to include the previously separate small instance."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example shows that each colored object in the input grid is replaced by an expanded version of itself in the output grid, except for any isolated pixels. For example, the top-left corner of the input grid features a square of color 1, which becomes a larger square in the output grid. Similarly, the bottom-right corner of the input grid includes a square of color 2, which also grows in the output grid.",
        "object_changes": "Each colored object in the input grid appears in the output grid but with an increased area. However, any isolated pixels disappear in the output grid. This means that the total number of objects remains the same."
    },
    "<example_3_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "Similar to Example 2, the input grid undergoes a transformation where each colored object is replaced by an expanded version of itself in the output grid, excluding isolated pixels. For example, the top row of the input grid consists of two disconnected squares of color 3, which combine into a single larger square in the output grid. The same occurs for the other colored objects in the grid.",
        "object_changes": "As in Example 2, each colored object in the input grid appears in the output grid but with an increased area. Isolated pixels do not appear in the output grid. Thus, the total number of objects stays constant across both grids."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The common theme among these examples is that each colored object in the input grid is transformed into a larger version of itself in the output grid, preserving the overall arrangement of objects. However, any isolated pixels are removed from the final result. This transformation does not affect the position of the remaining objects relative to one another.",
    "instructions": [
        "For each non-zero pixel in the input grid, find the largest possible rectangle of the same color that includes that pixel.",
        "Replace each such rectangle in the input grid with a larger version of itself, maintaining the aspect ratio. Place this new rectangle in the exact same position in the output grid.",
        "Remove any isolated pixels from the output grid."
    ],
    "test_case_input_copy": "[[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]]",
    "test_case_grid_view": "The test input grid contains five rows and five columns. It features multiple colored objects dispersed throughout the grid: a blue object (color 7) located in columns 3 and 4; a yellow object (color 9) situated in columns 1 and 4; a red object (color 1) positioned in column 2; a green object (color 5) spanning columns 3 and 4; and a purple object (color 8) found in columns 4 and 5.",
    "test_case_object_view": "There are six distinct objects in the test input grid: two blue objects (one in column 3 and another in column 4), a yellow object (in column 4), a red object (in column 2), a green object (spanning columns 3 and 4), and a purple object (covering columns 4 and 5). There are no isolated pixels.",
    "test_case_transformation": "To obtain the desired output, apply the following steps:

1. Identify the largest rectangles formed by each color group (blue, yellow, red, green, and purple).
2. Enlarge each rectangle while maintaining its aspect ratio.
3. Replace the original rectangles in the input grid with their enlarged counterparts in the output grid.
4. Remove any isolated pixels from the output grid.",

    "test_case_output": "[[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]]"
