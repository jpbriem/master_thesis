prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 4], [3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 7]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2], [5, 0, 5, 5]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'All instances of the digit `3` were removed from the input grid and replaced with zeros.', 'object_changes': 'There was an object of color `3` that covered coordinates `[0,1],[0,2],[0,5]`. This object disappeared in the output grid. There was also another object of color `3` covering coordinate `[1,5]`, which disappeared as well. An object of color `1` originally covering coordinates `[2,2],[2,3]` expanded to cover coordinates `[2,1],[2,2],[2,3]`. Two objects of color `8` merged into one big object of color `8` covering coordinates `[3,1],[3,2],[3,3],[3,4]`. Lastly, two separate objects of color `4` merged into one large object of color `4` covering coordinates `[4,3],[4,4]`.', 'overall_pattern': 'In each row of the input grid, any consecutive run of non-zero digits (objects) will merge together if they touch (have an edge touching). If there is no such run of non-zero digits, then that row remains unchanged in the output grid. Furthermore, any row containing a run of non-zero digits will have those digits moved to the far left side of the row, pushing all other elements to the right until they either reach the end of the row or touch another run of non-zero digits. All rows without runs of non-zero digits remain unchanged in the final output grid.', 'instructions': 'For each row of the input grid, find any consecutive runs of non-zero digits (objects). Merge these runs together if they touch (have an edge touching). Move any runs found to the farthest left position possible while maintaining their order and ensuring they do not overlap. Rows without runs of non-zero digits should remain unchanged in the final output grid.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'A grid of six rows and six columns where the top three rows are filled entirely with zeros. In the fourth row, we see a sequence of ones separated by a column of zeros. In the fifth row, we see a sequence of eights separated by two columns of zeros. Finally, in the sixth row, we see a sequence of fours separated by a column of zeros.', 'test_case_object_view': 'In this grid, there are five distinct objects. One object covers coordinates `[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]` and has color `8`. Another object covers coordinates `[5,3],[5,4]` and has color `4`. A third object covers coordinates `[2,2],[2,3]` and has color `1`. Fourthly, an object covers coordinates `[3,1],[3,2],[3,3],[3,4]` and has color `8`. Lastly, an object covers coordinates `[1,1],[1,2]` and has color `3`.', 'test_case_transformation': 'First, let us consider the first row of the input grid. We notice that there is no consecutive run of non-zero digits, so this row will remain unchanged in the final output grid. Next, we move onto the second row. Again, we observe that there is no consecutive run of non-zero digits, so this row will also remain unchanged in the final output grid. Now, moving onto the third row, we see that there are two runs of non-zero digits - one consisting of a single instance of color `1` and the other consisting of two instances of color `1`. These two runs touch, so we can merge them together into a single run of length three. Additionally, since the new run starts at index `0`, we know that it needs to be shifted all the way to the left-hand side of the row. After shifting the run over, we get the final output row of `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. For the fourth row, we again observe that there is a single run of non-zero digits, but now it consists of four instances of color `8`. Since the start index of this run is `1`, we shift it over one space to the left, giving us the final output row of `[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Moving onto the fifth row, we see that there are two runs of non-zero digits - one consisting of a single instance of color `4` and the other consisting of two instances of color `4`. However, these two runs do not touch, so we cannot merge them together. Instead, we simply leave them as-is and shift the first run over to the farthest left-hand side possible. Doing so gives us the final output row of `[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Finally, for the last row, we note that there are no runs of non-zero digits, so it remains unchanged in the final output grid.', 'test_case_output': '[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]'}
