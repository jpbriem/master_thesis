prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
```json
{
    "<example_1_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the pixels change from their original value (9) to another value (6), forming new objects. The number of pixels per row remains constant.",
        "object_changes": "There's a reduction in the total number of objects present in the output compared to the input. Specifically, two large rectangles (involving the pixels originally valued 9) shrink along their vertical edges towards the center of the grid, leaving gaps that form new smaller objects."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example exhibits similar pixel changes as Example 1. Here too, the pixels change from their original value (9) to another value (6). However, unlike Example 1, the number of pixels per row does not remain constant but varies across rows.",
        "object_changes": "The number of objects decreases as the larger rectangle shrinks along both horizontal and vertical edges, creating smaller rectangles in its wake."
    },
    "<example_3_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In Example 3, the pixels again change from an initial value (9) to another value (6), like in Examples 1 and 2. Unlike those examples though, the number of pixels per column remains constant here.",
        "object_changes": "Similar to the previous examples, there's a decrease in the total number of objects present in the output. This occurs because the largest rectangle involving the pixels originally valued 9 contracts along its vertical edge while expanding horizontally, thereby dividing itself into several smaller rectangles."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "A common thread across these examples is the shrinking of a dominant object(s) (initially represented by the pixels having value 9) due to the introduction of a new color (represented by pixels having value 6). Depending on the specific dimensions of the input grid, the shrinkage could result in either no change in the number of columns/rows (Examples 1 and 3) or a variable number of columns/rows (Example 2). Additionally, the shrinking process often splits the initial dominant object into multiple smaller ones.",
    "instructions": [
        "Step 1: Identify the dominant object(s) initially represented by the pixels having value 9.",
        "Step 2: Starting from the topmost/bottommost left/right corners, gradually replace the pixels of the identified dominant object(s) with the new color (represented by pixels having value 6).",
        "Step 3: Continue replacing the pixels until reaching the opposite corner of the grid.",
        "Step 4: If any gaps emerge during the replacement process, identify them as separate objects.",

In addition, there's another square-like structure in the lower-right corner of the grid also composed of pixels having a value of 9. These pixels extend up to the fourth row and seventh column. Finally, there're some isolated instances of pixels having a value of 6 scattered around the grid.",
