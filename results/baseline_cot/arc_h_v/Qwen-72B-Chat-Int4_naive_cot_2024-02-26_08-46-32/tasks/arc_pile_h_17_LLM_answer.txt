prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 1, 1, 1], [5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 2]]

Sample Outputs:

Specifically, each row and column now contains exactly one non-zero pixel.', 'object_changes': 'in the input, there are six distinct objects (colors), while in the output, each row and column contains exactly one unique color. Therefore, we end up with six objects in total - one per row and column.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'the input has eight non-zero pixels that were grouped together in two clusters, one in the top-left corner and another in the bottom-right corner. In the output, these pixels are spread out across three rows and columns, creating four separate objects.', 'object_changes': 'there are seven distinct objects in the input, but in the output, we get five objects - one in each row and column except for the middle column where there are two objects stacked vertically.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'the input has nine non-zero pixels that were rearranged to form a checkerboard-like pattern in the output. Each row and column alternates between having a non-zero pixel and a zero pixel.', 'object_changes': 'there are five distinct objects in the input, whereas in the output, we have six objects - one in each row and column except for the second row where there are no non-zero pixels.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'the input-output relationship involves moving the non-zero pixels from the input grid to specific locations in the output grid such that each row and column contains exactly one unique color. This results in a new set of objects in the output grid, where each row and column has its own distinct object.', 'instructions': 'to perform this transformation, follow these steps:

1. iterate through each row in the input grid.
2. within each row, identify the index of the first non-zero pixel.
3. if there is no non-zero pixel in the row, skip to the next row.
4. create an empty output row of the same length as the input row.
5. assign the value of the identified non-zero pixel to the cell in the output row at the same index as the input row.
6. repeat steps 2-5 for each column in the input grid.
7. combine all the output rows to form the final output grid.

note that this process effectively moves each non-zero pixel from the input grid to a specific location in the output grid, ensuring that each row and column contains exactly one unique color.'}, 'test_case_input_copy': [[0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 1, 1, 1], [5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 2]], 'test_case_grid_view': 'the input grid consists of four rows and four columns. there are four non-zero pixels distributed across the grid:', 'test_case_object_view': 'there are four distinct objects in the input grid:', 'test_case_transformation': 'to obtain the desired output, we need to move the non-zero pixels to specific locations in the output grid:', 'test_case_output': np.array([[0, 0, 0, 7], [1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5], [2, 0, 0, 0]])}
