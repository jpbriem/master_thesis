            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 4, 0, 1], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 7, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 7, 0], [0, 5, 4, 7, 1]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 8]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 3]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], [6, 4, 5, 0, 0, 3], [6, 4, 5, 0, 0, 3]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 2, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'in row 3, column 3, pixel value changed from 4 to 0; in row 4, column 1, pixel value changed from 0 to 7; in row 5, column 3, pixel value changed from 0 to 4; in row 5, column 4, pixel value changed from 0 to 7; in row 5, column 5, pixel value changed from 0 to 1.', 'object_changes': 'no change in objects but their sizes increased due to the addition of new pixels.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'in rows 4 and 5, columns 5 and 6, two new pixels were added to each row with value 8.', 'object_changes': 'a new object was created in rows 4 and 5, columns 5 and 6, consisting of four pixels with value 8.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'in rows 1 and 4, columns 1 and 3, eight pixels were removed; in rows 1 and 4, columns 2 and 4, eight pixels were added; in rows 2 and 5, columns 1 through 4, twelve pixels were added; in rows 2 and 5, columns 5 and 6, six pixels were added.', 'object_changes': 'two existing objects merged together to form a larger object.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'the transformation involves adding or removing pixels around an existing object(s) while preserving the overall structure of the original grid.', 'instructions': 'for each input grid, identify any existing objects (groups of connected pixels with the same value). then determine if there are any areas where additional pixels need to be added or removed to modify the existing object(s), without changing the overall dimensions of the grid. finally, apply these modifications to create the output grid.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 2, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'there are three distinct regions in this grid - one in the top left corner with value 2, another in the bottom right corner with value 3, and a third in the middle with value 9. there are also some isolated pixels with values 7 and 6.', 'test_case_object_view': 'there are three objects in this grid - one consisting of two pixels with value 2 in the top left corner, another consisting of a single pixel with value 3 in the bottom right corner, and a third consisting of nine pixels with value 9 in the middle. there are also some noise pixels with values 7 and 6.', 'test_case_transformation': 'to create the output grid, we will add a border of pixels around the central object with value 9. specifically, we will add one row and one column of pixels with value 2 above and to the left of the central object, and one row and one column of pixels with value 6 below and to the right of the central object. this will result in a total of 14 pixels being added to the grid.', 'test_case_output': '[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]]'}"
