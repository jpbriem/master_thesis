prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

# Your Task:
You are to write code that reads the description of the test cases above and outputs the correct result.

# Input Format
Each line of the file contains an integer value separated by spaces.

# Output Format
For each test case, you must output the following information:
- A short description of the input-output pair.
- A short description of the transformation applied to the input-output pair.
- The resulting output grid.

# Sample Input
[[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]]

# Sample Output
Regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes:
The input has two connected areas of five pixels each. These areas are surrounded by three pixels of color 0. In the output, these areas are still connected but now they consist of four pixels of color 5 and one pixel of color 0.
Regarding the second example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes:
In the input, there are two connected areas of five pixels each. One area consists of five pixels of color 5, while the other area consists of five pixels of color 0. In the output, both areas remain connected but now they consist of five pixels of color 5.
Regarding the third example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes:
There are two connected areas of five pixels each. Both areas consist of five pixels of color 5. In the output, both areas remain connected but now they consist of five pixels of color 5.
Overall pattern:
The overall pattern is that the input always consists of two connected areas of five pixels each. Each area consists of five pixels of color 5. In the output, both areas remain connected but now they consist of five pixels of color 5.
Instructions:
Describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step:
First, we need to find out whether the input is symmetric or asymmetric. If it's symmetric, then we can apply the transformation symmetrically. Otherwise, we need to apply the transformation asymmetrically.
To do this, we will start by finding the center point of the input. We can do this by taking the average of the x and y coordinates of all the pixels in the input. Once we have found the center point, we can draw a horizontal line through it. This line will divide the input into two halves. We can then apply the transformation to each half separately.
Once we have done this, we can join the two halves together again using the original center point. Finally, we can add any additional details such as borders or shading to make our final image look professional!
