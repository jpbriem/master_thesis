prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

 Here's the JSON response you requested:
```json
{
    "example_1_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input grid has a total of 6 pixels, each with a value ranging from 0 to 9. The output grid also has 6 pixels, but their values are different. Specifically, the first row of the output grid contains the same values as the first row of the input grid (i.e., all zeros), while the second row of the output grid contains the same values as the third row of the input grid (i.e., all ones). Similarly, the third row of the output grid contains the same values as the fourth row of the input grid (i.e., all twos), and so on. In other words, the output grid is obtained by shifting each row of the input grid by two positions to the right.",
        "object_changes": "There are no objects in this example."
    },
    "example_2_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example is similar to Example 1, except that the output grid is obtained by shifting each row of the input grid by three positions to the right instead of two. For example, the first row of the output grid contains the same values as the fifth row of the input grid, the second row of the output grid contains the same values as the sixth row of the input grid, and so on.",

Specifically, the first row of the output grid contains the same values as the second row of the input grid (i.e., all threes), the second row of the output grid contains the same values as the third row of the input grid (i.e., all fours), and so on. In other words, the output grid is obtained by flipping each row of the input grid horizontally.",
        "object_changes": "As before, there are no objects in this example."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "In all three examples, the input grid is shifted or flipped horizontally to obtain the output grid. Specifically, in Example 1, the rows are shifted by two positions to the right; in Example 2, the rows are shifted by three positions to the right; and in Example 3, the rows are flipped horizontally. This suggests that the transformation rule involves some kind of horizontal displacement or rotation of the input grid.",
    "instructions": "To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:
        1. If the input grid has an odd number of rows, add a new row of zeros to the end of the grid.
        2. If the input grid has an even number of rows, shift each row by two positions to the right.
        3. Flip the grid horizontally if it has an odd number of columns.
        4. Return the transformed grid.",
