            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

In this case, the input and output grids represent the same image, but with some modifications applied to the objects.\n\nHere's an explanation of each field:\n\n* `example_1_description`: This section describes the changes made to the input pixels and objects in Example 1. For example, it could say something like, \"In the output grid, all pixels with value 9 have been replaced with value 0, except for those belonging to objects. Additionally, all objects have been shifted horizontally by one pixel to the right.\"\n* `example_2_description`: This section would contain a description of Example 2, if applicable. It would follow the same format as Example 1.\n* `overall_pattern`: This section provides a general description of the input-output relationship that applies to all examples. For example, it could say something like, \"The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid, and all pixels with value 0 remain unchanged. Pixels with value 9 are replaced with a random integer between 1 and 8, while objects are moved horizontally by a random amount between -1 and 1 pixels.\"\n* `instructions`: This section provides detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation. For example, it could say something like, \"First, iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If the pixel has value 9, replace it with a random integer between 1 and 8. If the pixel has value 0, leave it unchanged. Next, iterate through each object in the input grid. For each object, move it horizontally by a random amount between -1 and 1 pixels. Finally, copy the modified input grid to create the output grid.\"\n* `test_case_input_copy`: This section instructs the user to copy the test case input grid from the task.\n* `test_case_grid_view`: This section asks the user to describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns. For example, it could ask, \"What is the distribution of pixels with values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9? Are there any patterns or repetitions?\"\n* `test_case_object_view`: This section asks the user to describe the objects in the input grid, focusing on color, size, coordinates, movement, shape, and object number. For example, it could ask, \"How many objects are in the input grid? What are their colors (represented by integers)? How large are they (in terms of number of pixels)? Where are their coordinates relative to the top-left corner of the grid? Have any objects been moved or resized compared to their original positions?\"\n* `test_case_transformation`: This section describes the transformation that needs to be applied to the input grid to produce the output grid. For example, it could say something like, \"Apply the following transformation to the input grid: Replace all pixels with value 9 with a random integer between 1 and 8. Move all objects horizontally by a random amount between -1 and 1 pixels."
