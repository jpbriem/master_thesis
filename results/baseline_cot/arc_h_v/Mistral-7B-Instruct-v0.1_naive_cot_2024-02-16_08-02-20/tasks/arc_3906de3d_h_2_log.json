            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

For each object in the input grid, check if it has any touching objects (i.e., objects that share an adjacent pixel). If an object has no touching objects, remove it from the output grid. Otherwise, keep it but change its position so that it does not overlap with any other objects.\n2. For each non-touching object in the input grid, create a new object in the output grid with the same color, size, and shape as the original object. Move this new object to a position where it does not overlap with any other objects.\n3. Fill the remaining empty spaces in the output grid with the background color.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this transformation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = np.zeros((len(input_grid), len(input_grid[0]), len(input_grid[0][0])), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Iterate through each object in the input grid\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            for k in range(len(input_grid[0][0])):\n                # Check if the current pixel is part of an object\n                if input_grid[i][j][k]!= 0:\n                    # Get the object's coordinates and size\n                    x1, y1, x2, y2 = get_object_coordinates(input_grid, i, j, k)\n                    \n                    # Create a new object in the output grid with the same color, size, and shape as the original object\n                    output_grid[x1:x2, y1:y2, :] = input_grid[i][j][k]\n                    \n                    # Remove the original object from the input grid\n                    input_grid[i][j][k] = 0\n                    \n                    # Move the new object to a position where it does not overlap with any other objects\n                    move_object(output_grid, x1, y1, x2, y2)\n                    \n    return output_grid\n\ndef get_object_coordinates(input_grid, i, j, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the coordinates of the object containing the pixel (i, j, k) in the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find the top-left corner of the object\n    x1, y1 = find_top_left_corner(input_grid, i, j, k)\n    \n    # Find the bottom-right corner of the object\n    x2, y2 = find_bottom_right_corner(input_grid, i, j, k)\n    \n    return x1, y1, x2, y2\n\ndef find_top_left_corner(input_grid, i, j, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the coordinates of the top-left corner of the object containing the pixel (i, j, k) in the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Search for the first pixel that is part of the object\n    while True:\n        x, y = i - 1, j - 1\n        if input_grid[x][y][k] == 1:\n            break\n        \n    # Return the coordinates of the top-left corner\n    return x, y\n\ndef find_bottom_right_corner(input_grid, i, j, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the object containing the pixel (i, j, k) in the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Search for the last pixel that is part of the object\n    while True:\n        x, y = i + 1, j + 1\n        if input_grid[x][y][k] == 1:\n            break\n        \n    # Return the coordinates of the bottom-right corner\n    return x, y\n\ndef move_object(output_grid, x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Moves the object at (x1, y1, :) to a position where it does not overlap with any other objects in the output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the minimum possible distance between the object and any other objects\n    min_distance = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(output_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(output_grid[0])):\n            for k in range(len(output_grid[0][0])):\n                if output_grid[i][j][k]!= 0 and output_grid[i][j][k]!= 1:\n                    dx, dy = abs(x1 - i), abs(y1 - j)\n                    d = np.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)\n                    if d < min_distance:\n                        min_distance = d\n                        new_x1, new_y1 = i - dx, j - dy\n                        new_x2, new_y2 = i + dx, j + dy\n                        \n    # Move the object to the calculated position\n    output_grid[new_x1:new_x2, new_y1:new_y2, :] = 1\n```"
