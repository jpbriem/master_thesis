prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Example_1 description:

* Pixel changes: In this example, the input and output grids differ mainly in terms of the presence or absence of certain pixels. Specifically, some pixels in the input grid are replaced with black pixels (background) in the output grid, while other pixels remain unchanged. This change occurs in rows where there is an object present in the input grid but not in the output grid. For example, row 2 has an object with color 2 and size 3, but it is missing in the output grid. As a result, all pixels in that row are replaced with black pixels. Similarly, row 4 has an object with color 3 and size 1, but it is also missing in the output grid. All pixels in that row are replaced with black pixels. On the other hand, some pixels in the input grid are replaced with white pixels (foreground) in the output grid, where there is no object present in the input grid but there is one in the output grid. For instance, row 5 has an object with color 3 and size 1, but it is missing in the input grid. As a result, all pixels in that row are replaced with white pixels.
* Object changes: In this example, the input and output grids differ mainly in terms of the presence or absence of certain objects. Specifically, some objects in the input grid are removed from the output grid, while others remain unchanged. This change occurs in rows where there is an object present in the input grid but not in the output grid. For example, row 2 has an object with color 2 and size 3, but it is missing in the output grid. As a result, that object is removed from the output grid. Similarly, row 4 has an object with color 3 and size 1, but it is also missing in the output grid. That object is also removed from the output grid. On the other hand, some objects in the input grid are added to the output grid, where there is no object present in the input grid but there is one in the output grid. For instance, row 5 has an object with color 3 and size 1, but it is missing in the input grid. As a result, that object is added to the output grid.

Overall pattern:

* The input-output relationship is such that if an object is present in the input grid but not in the output grid, then all pixels in that row are replaced with black pixels (background). If an object is present in the output grid but not in the input grid, then all pixels in that row are replaced with white pixels (foreground). If an object is present in both the input and output grids, then it remains unchanged in the output grid.
* The input-output relationship is also such that if an object is present in the input grid but not in the output grid, then that object is removed from the output grid. If an object is present in the output grid but not in the input grid, then that object is also removed from the output grid. If an object is present in both the input and output grids, then it remains unchanged in the output grid.

Instructions:

* To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:
	+ Iterate through each row in the input grid.
	+ Check if the current row has an object present in the input grid but not in the output grid. If so, replace all pixels in that row with black pixels (background).
	+ Check if the current row has an object present in the output grid but not in the input grid. If so, replace all pixels in that row with white pixels (foreground).
	+ Check if the current row has an object present in both the input and output grids. If so, leave that row unchanged in the output grid.
	+ Repeat the above process for all rows in the input grid.
