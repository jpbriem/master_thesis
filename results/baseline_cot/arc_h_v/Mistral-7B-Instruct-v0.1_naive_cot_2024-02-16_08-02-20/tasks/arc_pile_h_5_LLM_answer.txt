prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1], [4, 4, 0, 4]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3]]
output: [[7, 7, 7, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 6, 0], [9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[8, 8, 8, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into an output grid based on certain rules or patterns. The input and output grids represent images with objects and backgrounds, where objects are defined as regions of similar colors or surrounding pixels. The transformation may involve geometric operations such as scaling, rotation, translation, and deformation, as well as arithmetic operations based on objects or shapes.

To complete this task, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Test Case Input Copy: Copy the test case input grid from the task description.
```python
import numpy as np

test_case_input = np.array([[7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0],
                           [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
                           [4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
                           [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]])
```
1. Test Case Grid View: Describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.
```python
def describe_grid(grid):
    print("Input grid:")
    for row in range(len(grid)):
        print(f"Row {row}: {grid[row]}")
    print("\nOutput grid:")
    for row in range(len(grid)):
        print(f"Row {row}: {transformed_grid[row]}")

describe_grid(test_case_input)
```
1. Test Case Object View: Describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, movement, shape, and object number.
```python
def describe_objects(grid):
    print("Objects in input grid:")
    obj_count = 0
    for row in range(len(grid)):
        for col in range(len(grid[row])):
            if grid[row][col]!= 0:
                obj_count += 1
                print(f"Object {obj_count}: ({col}, {row}), color={grid[row][col]}, size=1")
    print("\nObjects in output grid:")
    obj_count = 0
    for row in range(len(transformed_grid)):
        for col in range(len(transformed_grid[row])):
            if transformed_grid[row][col]!= 0:
                obj_count += 1
                print(f"Object {obj_count}: ({col}, {row}), color={transformed_grid[row][col]}, size=1")

describe_objects(test_case_input)
```
1. Test Case Transformation: Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed.
```python
def apply_transformation(grid):
    # Apply the transformation rule here
    return transformed_grid

# Example transformation rule:
# Replace every occurrence of color 7 with color 0 (background), and every occurrence of color 0 with color 8
transformed_grid = apply_transformation(test_case_input)
```
1. Test Case Output: Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array.
```python
print("Transformed grid:")
for row in range(len(transformed_grid)):
    print(f"Row {row}: {transformed_grid[row]}")
```
1. Overall Pattern Description: Describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs.
```python
def overall_pattern_description(grid1, grid2):
    # Compare the two grids and describe the differences
    # This function should be implemented based on the specific transformation pattern
    pass

overall_pattern_description(test_case_input, transformed_grid)
```
1. Instructions: Describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step.
```python
def instructions():
    # Provide detailed instructions on how to implement the transformation based on the specific pattern
    pass

instructions()
```
