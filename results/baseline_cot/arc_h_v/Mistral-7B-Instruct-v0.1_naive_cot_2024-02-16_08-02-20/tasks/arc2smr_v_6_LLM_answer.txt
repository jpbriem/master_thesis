prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Overall pattern:

* The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
* Each pixel in the input grid has a value between 0 and 8 (inclusive), representing a specific color.
* The output grid also has values between 0 and 8, but some of these values may differ from those in the input grid.
* The difference between the input and output pixels depends on the position of each pixel in the input grid relative to certain other pixels in the grid.
* Specifically, if two adjacent pixels in the input grid have the same color, then their corresponding pixels in the output grid will have the same color.
* However, if two adjacent pixels in the input grid have different colors, then their corresponding pixels in the output grid will have different colors.
* In addition, there may be some noise pixels in both the input and output grids that do not follow this rule.

Instructions:

1. For each pixel in the input grid, check whether it is adjacent to any other pixels in the grid.
2. If the current pixel is adjacent to another pixel, compare the colors of the two pixels.
3. If the colors are the same, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the same color as the current pixel.
4. If the colors are different, randomly choose one of the two colors and set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to that color.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all pixels in the input grid.
6. Return the resulting output grid as a numpy array.

Test case input copy:
```python
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Test case grid view:
The input grid consists of 2D arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 8. Each row contains 5 elements, and each element corresponds to a pixel in the grid. The pixels form a square shape with side length 5. There are no gaps or empty spaces between the pixels.

Test case object view:
Each object in the input grid consists of a sequence of connected pixels with the same color. The objects are arranged in a diagonal pattern across the grid, starting from the top left corner and moving diagonally towards the bottom right corner. There are three objects in total, each consisting of 3x3 pixels. The objects are labeled A, B, and C, and they are colored blue, green, and red, respectively. The objects overlap slightly with each other, so that some pixels belong to more than one object.

Test case transformation:
The transformation involves replacing each pixel in the input grid with a new pixel based on the colors of its neighboring pixels. Specifically, if two adjacent pixels have the same color, then their corresponding pixels in the output grid will have the same color. Otherwise, the corresponding pixels in the output grid will have different colors. The exact algorithm used to determine the new colors is not specified, but it likely involves random selection or some other heuristic.
