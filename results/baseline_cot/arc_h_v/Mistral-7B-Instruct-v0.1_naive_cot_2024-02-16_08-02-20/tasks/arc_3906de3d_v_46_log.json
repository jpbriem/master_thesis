            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

In this case, the input and output grids represent the same image, but with some modifications applied to the objects.\n\nHere's an explanation of each field:\n\n* `example_1_description`: This section describes the changes made to the input pixels and objects in Example 1. For example, it could say something like, \"In the output grid, the color of object 1 has been changed from red (value 2) to blue (value 3), while the size of object 2 has been increased by one unit in both dimensions.\"\n* `example_2_description`: This section provides additional details about Example 2, such as any specific rules or conditions that were followed during the transformation process.\n* `overall_pattern`: This section describes the general pattern used to transform the input grids into output grids. It should include enough information to allow someone else to understand how the transformation works without needing access to the specific implementation.\n* `instructions`: This section provides detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation, including any necessary steps or considerations.\n* `test_case_input_copy`: This section instructs the reader to copy the test case input grid from the task.\n* `test_case_grid_view`: This section describes the pixels of the entire grid in the test case, focusing on any patterns or features that may be relevant to the transformation.\n* `test_case_object_view`: This section describes the objects in the test case, including their colors, sizes, coordinates, and any other relevant attributes.\n* `test_case_transformation`: This section explains how the grid or objects should be transformed, using the language and terminology established in the overall pattern description.\n* `test_case_output`: This section provides instructions on how to create the resulting output grid as a numpy array."
