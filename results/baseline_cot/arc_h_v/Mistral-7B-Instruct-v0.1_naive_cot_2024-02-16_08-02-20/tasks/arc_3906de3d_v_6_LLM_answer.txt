prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

To provide more information about each field, I will assume that the input and output grids follow the same pattern as the provided examples. In this case, the overall pattern is to apply a transformation to the input grid that results in an identical output grid.

For example\_1\_description, the changes between the input and output pixels focus on pattern changes. For instance, the input grid has a diagonal pattern of alternating colors (red and blue), while the output grid has a horizontal pattern of alternating colors (blue and red). Similarly, the input grid has a vertical pattern of alternating colors (green and yellow) in the center region, while the output grid has a diagonal pattern of alternating colors (yellow and green) in the center region.

For example\_2\_description, ellipsis refers to the fact that there is no specific description provided for this example.

Overall\_pattern describes the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs. In this case, the input and output grids always have the same dimensions and contain the same number of objects with the same colors and sizes. The objects also move in the same way, either horizontally or vertically.

Instructions provides detailed steps for performing the transformation. In this case, the instructions would involve applying a series of operations to the input grid to create the output grid. These operations could include shifting the grid horizontally or vertically, flipping it horizontally or vertically, and changing the colors of certain objects.

Test\_case\_input\_copy involves copying the test case input grid from the task. This is necessary because the input grid needs to be used as a starting point for the transformation.

Test\_case\_grid\_view focuses on describing the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns. In this case, the input grid has a diagonal pattern of alternating colors, a vertical pattern of alternating colors in the center region, and a horizontal pattern of alternating colors in the bottom right corner.

Test\_case\_object\_view focuses on describing the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number. In this case, the input grid contains three objects: two circles and one square. The circles have a radius of 1 and are colored blue, while the square has a side length of 2 and is colored red. The circles are located at coordinates (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1), while the square is located at coordinates (1, 4).

Test\_case\_transformation describes how the grid or objects should be transformed. In this case, the input grid should be shifted horizontally by 1 unit, flipped vertically, and then shifted vertically by 1 unit. Additionally, the colors of the circles should be changed so that they are now red, and the square should be moved to coordinates (0, 4).

Finally, test\_case\_output creates the resulting output grid as a numpy array.
