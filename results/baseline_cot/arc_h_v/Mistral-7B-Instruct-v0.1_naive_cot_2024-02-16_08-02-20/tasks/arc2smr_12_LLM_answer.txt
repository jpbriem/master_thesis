prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Overall pattern:

* The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
* Each element in the input grid corresponds to an element in the output grid.
* If an element in the input grid has value 1 (i.e., it's a colored pixel), then the corresponding element in the output grid will also have value 1.
* Otherwise, if an element in the input grid has value 0 (i.e., it's a background pixel), then the corresponding element in the output grid will also have value 0.
* However, there may be some additional rules or conditions that determine how the elements in the input and output grids correspond. These rules or conditions depend on the specific input-output pair and need to be determined through analysis of the given examples.

Instructions:

1. For each input-output pair, analyze the differences between the input and output grids. Pay attention to the patterns and structures in both grids.
2. Identify any commonalities or regularities between the input and output grids. This could include things like the presence or absence of certain colors, the arrangement of objects, or the overall layout of the grid.
3. Based on the identified commonalities or regularities, develop a set of rules or conditions that describe how the input and output grids correspond. These rules or conditions should be general enough to apply to all input-output pairs, but specific enough to accurately capture the relationships between the input and output grids in each case.
4. Use the developed rules or conditions to transform the test input grid into its corresponding output grid. Be sure to follow the rules or conditions carefully and consistently.
5. Output the results in the specified JSON format.
