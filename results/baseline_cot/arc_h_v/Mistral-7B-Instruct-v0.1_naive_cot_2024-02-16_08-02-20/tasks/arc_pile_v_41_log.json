            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 7, 0], [0, 0, 2, 7, 9]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 1, 9, 0, 0], [7, 1, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [7, 1, 9, 5, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[7, 6, 3, 0], [0, 6, 3, 0], [7, 0, 0, 2], [7, 0, 3, 0]]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Based on the provided examples, it seems that the transformation involves shifting the position of certain objects horizontally or vertically while keeping their original color and size. In Example_1, the second object was shifted two positions to the right, and in Example_2, the third object was shifted three positions to the left. In Example_3, the first object was shifted one position to the left and the fourth object was shifted one position to the right.\n\nTo transform the test case input grid into its corresponding output grid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input grid based on their color and size.\n2. Determine the direction and amount of shift for each object. For this example, we will assume that the first object needs to be shifted one position to the left, and the fourth object needs to be shifted one position to the right.\n3. Apply the shifts to the objects by moving them horizontally or vertically while keeping their original color and size.\n4. Replace the input grid with the transformed output grid.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform the transformation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Test case input grid\ninput_grid = np.array([[7, 6, 3, 0], [0, 6, 3, 0], [7, 0, 0, 2], [7, 0, 3, 0]])\n\n# Define the shifts for each object\nshifts = {\n    0: [-1, 0], # First object needs to be shifted one position to the left\n    3: [1, 0]   # Fourth object needs to be shifted one position to the right\n}\n\n# Perform the shifts on the objects\nfor i, obj in enumerate(input_grid):\n    if obj == 0:\n        continue # Skip the background pixels\n    x, y = obj[:2] # Extract the x and y coordinates of the object\n    size = obj[-1] # Extract the size of the object\n    dx, dy = shifts[i] # Get the direction and amount of shift for the object\n    new_x, new_y = x + dx * size, y + dy * size # Calculate the new coordinates of the object after the shift\n    input_grid[i] = np.array([new_x, new_y, obj[2:]]) # Update the object with the new coordinates\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = input_grid.copy()\n\n# Print the results\nprint('Overall pattern:')\nprint('Regarding the input-output relationship, the objects are shifted horizontally or vertically while keeping their original color and size.')\nprint('Instructions:')\nprint('Shift the first object one position to the left, and the fourth object one position to the right.')\nprint('Test case input copy:')\nprint(input_grid)\nprint('Test case grid view:')\nprint(input_grid)\nprint('Test case object view:')\nprint(input_grid)\nprint('Test case transformation:')\nprint('Shift the first object one position to the left, and the fourth object one position to the right.')\nprint('Test case output:')\nprint(output_grid)\n```\nOutput:\n```yaml\n{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes':'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes':'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description':'regarding the second example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'example_3_description':'regarding the third example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view':'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view':'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}\n```"
