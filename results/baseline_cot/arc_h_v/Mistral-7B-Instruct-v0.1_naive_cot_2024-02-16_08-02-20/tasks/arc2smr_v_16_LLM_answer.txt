prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Overall pattern:

The input-output relationship is defined by applying a set of rules to each object in the input grid. These rules involve moving, scaling, and rotating the objects based on their position, size, and color. The resulting output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid but may contain different objects or modified versions of existing objects.

Instructions:

1. For each object in the input grid, check if it touches any other objects horizontally or vertically. If an object does not touch any other objects, skip it. Otherwise, find the adjacent pixels that belong to the same object as the current object.
2. For each pair of adjacent objects, calculate the distance between them along the horizontal or vertical axis (depending on whether they are touching horizontally or vertically).
3. If the distance between two adjacent objects is less than or equal to the sum of their sizes, merge them into a single larger object. Set the merged object's color to the average of the original colors of the two objects.
4. If the distance between two adjacent objects is greater than the sum of their sizes, move the smaller object towards the larger object until they touch. Set the merged object's color to the color of the larger object.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all objects in the input grid.
6. Return the resulting output grid.

Test case input copy:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Test case grid view:
The entire grid consists of 2D arrays of pixels. Each pixel has a value ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and 1-9 represent different colored pixels. There are no special patterns or structures in the grid.

Test case object view:
Each object in the input grid is represented by a tuple containing four elements: the object's coordinates (as a tuple of two integers), its size (an integer), its color (an integer), and its shape (a string indicating either "rect" or "circle"). The objects are arranged such that adjacent objects touch horizontally or vertically.

Test case transformation:
For each object in the input grid, apply the following transformation rules:

1. If the object is a rectangle, rotate it clockwise by 90 degrees.
2. If the object is a circle, scale it down by a factor of 0.8.
3. Move the object to the center of its respective row or column (depending on whether it is touching horizontally or vertically).
4. If the object is a rectangle, flip it horizontally.
5. If the object is a circle, shift
