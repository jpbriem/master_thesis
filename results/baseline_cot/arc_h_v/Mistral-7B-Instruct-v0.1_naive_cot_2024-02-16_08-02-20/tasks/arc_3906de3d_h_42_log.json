            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

In this case, the input and output grids represent the same image, but with some modifications applied to the objects.\n\nHere's an explanation of each field:\n\n* `example_1_description`: This section describes the changes made to the input pixels and objects in Example 1. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ Pixel changes: In the output grid, some pixels have been replaced with zeros (background color) while others have been replaced with specific colors. Additionally, some pixels have been flipped horizontally or vertically.\n\t+ Object changes: Some objects have been removed from the output grid, while others have been moved or resized. The colors of some objects have also been changed.\n* `example_2_description`: This section would contain a description of Example 2, if applicable. It would follow the same format as Example 1.\n* `overall_pattern`: This section provides a general description of the input-output relationship that applies to all input-output pairs. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ The input and output grids always have the same dimensions, and the output grid contains the same number of objects as the input grid.\n\t+ Each object in the input grid has a corresponding object in the output grid, with the same color and size. However, the positions and shapes of the objects may be different.\n* `instructions`: This section provides detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ Loop through each pixel in the input grid.\n\t+ If the pixel is part of an object, check if the object needs to be moved or resized.\n\t+ If the object needs to be moved, update its position in the output grid.\n\t+ If the object needs to be resized, adjust its size in the output grid.\n\t+ If the pixel is not part of an object, replace it with the appropriate color based on its position in the grid.\n* `test_case_input_copy`: This section provides instructions on how to copy the test case input grid from the task.\n* `test_case_grid_view`: This section provides a description of the pixels in the entire grid of the test case input, focusing on patterns. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ The input grid consists of alternating rows of black and white pixels.\n\t+ There are three objects in the grid, arranged diagonally from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.\n* `test_case_object_view`: This section provides a description of the objects in the test case input, focusing on color, size, coordinates, movement, shape, and object number. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ There are three objects in the grid, labeled A, B, and C.\n\t+ Object A is a square with a red color and a size of 2x2 pixels. Its coordinates are (0, 0).\n\t+ Object B is a circle with a blue color and a size of 1 pixel. Its coordinates are (3, 3).\n\t+ Object C is a triangle with a green color and a size of 1x2 pixels. Its coordinates are (6, 0).\n* `test_case_transformation`: This section provides a description of how the grid or objects should be transformed. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ Move object A two pixels to the right.\n\t+ Resize object B to be a square with a size of 2x2 pixels.\n\t+ Rotate object C clockwise by 90 degrees.\n* `test_case_output`: This section provides instructions on how to create the resulting output grid as a numpy array. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ Create a new numpy array with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\t+ Set the background color (zero) for all pixels except those belonging to objects.\n\t+ Loop through each object in the input grid and set the corresponding pixels in the output grid to the appropriate color and size."
