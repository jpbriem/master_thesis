            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

In this case, the overall pattern is to apply a translation transformation to the input grid, shifting it horizontally by a certain number of pixels. This shift value depends on the position of the first object in the input grid. Specifically, if the first object has a coordinate (x, y) where x is even, then the output grid will be shifted by 2 pixels to the right. Otherwise, the output grid will be shifted by 1 pixel to the right.\n\nHere's an explanation of each field:\n\n* `example_1_description`: This section describes the changes made to the input and output pixels and objects in Example 1. For the pixels, we can see that they remain mostly unchanged, except for the edges of the grid. The leftmost and rightmost columns of the input grid are shifted two pixels to the right in the output grid. Similarly, the topmost and bottommost rows of the input grid are shifted two pixels upwards in the output grid. These shifts correspond to the horizontal and vertical translations applied to the input grid. As for the objects, we can see that their positions and sizes remain the same in both the input and output grids. However, their colors change slightly. Specifically, the first object in the input grid has a color of 9, while the first object in the output grid has a color of 8. This change corresponds to the fact that the input grid was shifted two pixels to the right, causing the first object to overlap with the second object in the input grid. To avoid overlapping the objects in the output grid, we need to adjust their colors so that they don't interfere with each other. We do this by subtracting 1 from the color of the first object in the input grid, resulting in a color of 8 for the first object in the output grid.\n* `example_2_description`: This section is empty because there is no additional description needed for Example 2.\n* `overall_pattern`: This section provides a general description of the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs. Based on the provided examples, we can see that the input and output grids always follow the same pattern: the input grid is translated horizontally by a certain number of pixels depending on the position of the first object in the input grid.\n* `instructions`: This section provides detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation step by step. To transform the input grid, we need to first determine the shift value based on the position of the first object in the input grid. If the first object has a coordinate (x, y) where x is even, then the output grid will be shifted by 2 pixels to the right. Otherwise, the output grid will be shifted by 1 pixel to the right. Once we have determined the shift value, we can simply translate the input grid horizontally by that amount.\n* `test_case_input_copy`: This section instructs the user to copy the test case input grid from the task.\n* `test_case_grid_view`: This section describes the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns. In this case, the input grid consists of a single row of pixels,"
