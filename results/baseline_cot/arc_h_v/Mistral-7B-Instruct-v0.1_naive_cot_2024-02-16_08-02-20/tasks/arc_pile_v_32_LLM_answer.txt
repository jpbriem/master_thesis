prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 1, 0, 0], [0, 7, 1, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 8, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 8, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [4, 3, 8, 9, 1]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 9, 1], [4, 3, 8, 9, 1]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 3, 7, 4, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 3, 7, 4, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]]

Sample Outputs:
 Example_1:
Input: [[0, 3, 7, 4, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 3, 7, 4, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]]
Output: [[0, 3, 7, 4, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 3, 7, 4, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]]

Description:
Regarding the first example, the changes between the input and output pixels focus on pattern changes. Specifically, the input grid has a diagonal pattern of alternating colors (black and white) in the upper left corner, while the output grid maintains this pattern but extends it to the rest of the grid. This indicates that the transformation involves scaling the pattern horizontally and vertically.

Regarding the first example, the changes between the input and output objects focus on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number. Specifically, the input grid contains two objects: Object_1 with color '3', size 3, coordinates [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], and Object_2 with color '4', size 1, coordinates [[0,4]]. The output grid also contains these two objects, but their positions have been adjusted to maintain the original pattern. Therefore, the transformation does not involve any changes to the objects themselves.

Overall pattern:
The input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs involves scaling the pattern horizontally and vertically while maintaining the original object positions.

Instructions:
To transform the test input grid, follow these steps:
1. Scale the pattern horizontally and vertically to match the dimensions of the output grid.
2. Maintain the original object positions in the scaled grid.

Test case input copy:
Copy the test case input grid from the task description.

Test case grid view:
Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.
The test input grid has a diagonal pattern of alternating colors (black and white) in the upper left corner, extending to the rest of the grid.

Test case object view:
Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, movement, shape, and object number.
The test input grid contains two objects: Object_1 with color '3', size 3, coordinates [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], and Object_2 with color '4', size 1, coordinates [[0,4]].

Test case transformation:
Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed.
The grid should be scaled horizontally and vertically to match the dimensions of the output grid, while maintaining the original object positions.

Test case output:
Create the resulting output grid as numpy array.
The resulting output grid will have the same pattern as the input grid, but extended to the full dimensions of the output grid. The objects will remain in their original positions.
