            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

In each row, the elements of the input grid are shifted horizontally by a certain amount, depending on their position in the row. Specifically, the first element is shifted by 1, the second element by 2, the third element by 3, and so on. This shift continues until the last element of the row, which is shifted by the maximum value of the row minus 1. For example, if the row has 6 elements, then the first element is shifted by 1, the second element by 2, the third element by 3, the fourth element by 4, the fifth element by 5, and the sixth element by 6. If the row has fewer than 6 elements, then the shift will stop at the end of the row.\n\nFor example, consider the input row [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Since there are 6 elements in this row, the first element is shifted by 1 (to become 1), the second element is shifted by 2 (to become 2), the third element is shifted by 3 (to become 3), the fourth element is shifted by 4 (to become 4), the fifth element is shifted by 5 (to become 5), and the sixth element is shifted by 6 (to become 6). Therefore, the output row for this input row is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\n\nSimilarly, consider the input row [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Since there are 12 elements in this row, the first element is shifted by 1 (to become 1), the second element is shifted by 2 (to become 2), the third element is shifted by 3 (to become 3), and so on. However, since there are only 12 elements in this row, the shift will stop after the tenth element (which is shifted by 9). Therefore, the output row for this input row is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each row of the input grid.\n2. For each row, create an empty list to store the elements of the corresponding row in the output grid.\n3. Loop through each element of the input row, starting from the first element.\n4. For each element, calculate its shift value based on its position in the row (as described above).\n5. Add the shifted element to the output row list.\n6. Once all elements have been processed, append the output row list to the output grid.\n\nTest case input copy:\n```python\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nTest case grid view:\n```css\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nTest case object view:\n```yaml\nObjects:\n- Object 1:\n    - Color: 1\n    - Coordinates: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n    - Size: 3\n- Object 2:\n    - Color: 3\n    - Coordinates: [4, 4, 4, 4]\n    - Size: 4\n- Object 3:\n    - Color: 2\n    - Coordinates: [1, 4, 1, 4]\n    - Size: 3\n- Object 4:\n    - Color: 3\n    - Coordinates: [2, 4, 2, 4]\n    - Size: 4\n- Object 5:\n    - Color: 2\n    - Coordinates: [1, 0, 1, 0]\n    - Size: 3\n- Object 6:\n    - Color: 3\n    - Coordinates: [4, 0, 4, 0]\n    - Size: 4\n- Object 7:\n    - Color: 1\n    - Coordinates: [1, 2, 1, 2]\n    - Size: 3\n- Object 8:\n    - Color: 3\n    - Coordinates: [4, 2, 4, 2]\n    - Size: 4\n- Object 9:\n    - Color:"
