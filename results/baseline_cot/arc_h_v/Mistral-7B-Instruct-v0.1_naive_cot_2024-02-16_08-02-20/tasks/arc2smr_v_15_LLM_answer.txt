prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Overall pattern:
The input-output relationship is such that each row of the input grid corresponds to a row in the output grid, where each element in the input row is replaced by an element in the output row according to certain rules. These rules depend on the position of the element in the input row and its value. Specifically, if the element has a value of 0, it is replaced by a random value between 1 and 8 (inclusive). If the element has a value of 1, it is replaced by a random value between 2 and 7 (inclusive), except for the value 6, which is always replaced by 1. If the element has a value of 2, it is replaced by a random value between 3 and 8 (inclusive), except for the values 4 and 6, which are always replaced by 2. If the element has a value of 3, it is replaced by a random value between 4 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 5, which is always replaced by 3. If the element has a value of 4, it is replaced by a random value between 5 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 6, which is always replaced by 4. If the element has a value of 5, it is replaced by a random value between 6 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 7, which is always replaced by 5. If the element has a value of 6, it is replaced by a random value between 7 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 8, which is always replaced by 6. If the element has a value of 7, it is replaced by a random value between 8 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 8, which is always replaced by 7. If the element has a value of 8, it is replaced by a random value between 1 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 0, which is always replaced by 8.

Instructions:
To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:

1. For each row in the input grid, iterate through each element in the row.
2. If the element has a value of 0, generate a random integer between 1 and 8 (inclusive) and replace the element with this value.
3. If the element has a value of 1, generate a random integer between 2 and 7 (inclusive), except for the value 6, which should be replaced by 1. Replace the element with this value.
4. If the element has a value of 2, generate a random integer between 3 and 8 (inclusive), except for the values 4 and 6, which should be replaced by 2. Replace the element with this value.
5. If the element has a value of 3, generate a random integer between 4 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 5, which should be replaced by 3. Replace the element with this value.
6. If the element has a value of 4, generate a random integer between 5 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 6, which should be replaced by 4. Replace the element with this value.
7. If the element has a value of 5, generate a random integer between 6 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 7, which should be replaced by 5. Replace the element with this value.
8. If the element has a value of 6, generate a random integer between 7 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 8, which should be replaced by 6. Replace the element with this value.
9. If the element has a value of 7, generate a random integer between 8 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 8, which should be replaced by 7. Replace the element with this value.
10. If the element has a value of 8, generate a random integer between 1 and 8 (inclusive), except for the value 0, which should be replaced by 8. Replace the element with this value.
11. Store the transformed row in the output grid.

Test case input copy:
Copy the input grid from the task.

Test case grid view:
Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.
The input grid consists of 2 rows and 5 columns. Each row contains elements ranging from 0 to 8, including the background color represented by 0. The elements in the first row range from 1 to 7, while the elements in the second row range from 2 to 8. There are no repeated elements in any row.

Test case object view:
Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.
There are no objects in the test input grid.

Test case transformation:
Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed.
The grid should be transformed such that each element in the input grid is replaced by a new element according to the rules described above.
