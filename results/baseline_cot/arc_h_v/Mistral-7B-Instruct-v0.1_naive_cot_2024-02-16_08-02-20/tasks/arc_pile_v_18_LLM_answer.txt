prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 8], [0, 0, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 8], [5, 0, 7, 8]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 1], [7, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [7, 5, 4, 0, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 7, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 3], [9, 4, 5, 7, 0, 3]]



Test case:
input: [[5, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 7, 0, 6], [5, 0, 4, 0]]

 Here's the information you requested:

Specifically, the first row and column of the input grid contain black pixels that need to be replaced with white pixels.

The fourth object in the input grid has its position shifted from (0, 0) to (0, 1).',
'overall_pattern': 'In both Examples_1 and Example_2, the input grid has some black pixels that need to be replaced with white pixels. In Example_1, this replacement occurs in the first row and column of the input grid, while in Example_2, it occurs in the second row and third row of the input grid. Additionally, in Example_2, there are some object changes that occur. However, these changes do not affect the overall pattern of replacing black pixels with white pixels.',
'instructions': 'To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:
1. Replace the first row and column of the input grid with white pixels.
2. If the input grid contains more than two rows, replace the second row and third row of the input grid with white pixels.
3. If the input grid contains more than four rows, replace the fifth row of the input grid with a white pixel.
4. If the input grid contains any objects, check their positions and sizes. If an object is located in the first row or column of the input grid, change its color to white. If an object is located in the second row or third row of the input grid, increase its size by 1. If an object is located in the fifth row of the input grid, shift its position to (0, 1).',
