            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [8, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7], [8, 4, 1, 3, 2, 7]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 4]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 4]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 6, 8, 7, 0], [0, 6, 8, 7, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[7, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 9, 8, 4], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Based on the provided examples, it seems that the transformation involves applying certain rules to each pixel in the input grid. For example, in Example_1, every pixel has been replaced with either a new value (e.g., 0) or an existing value (e.g., 7). In Example_2, every pixel has been replaced with a new value (e.g., 9), except for those with a value of 0. In Example_3, every pixel has been replaced with a new value (e.g., 8) if it was originally black (i.e., had a value of 0), and left unchanged otherwise.\n\nIn the test case, we need to apply the same set of rules to each pixel in the input grid. Specifically, we need to replace every pixel with a new value based on its current value and position in the grid. We also need to ensure that any touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel that is part of the same object.\n\nTo perform this transformation, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2. Iterate over each pixel in the input grid.\n3. If the pixel is black (i.e., has a value of 0), set its corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random non-zero value.\n4. If the pixel is white (i.e., has a value other than 0), check if there are any touching objects that are part of the same object as the current pixel. If so, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the same value as the current pixel. Otherwise, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random non-zero value.\n5. Return the output grid.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this transformation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros((len(input_grid), len(input_grid[0]), 1))\n    \n    # Iterate over each pixel in the input grid\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            # Check if the pixel is black\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random non-zero value\n                output_grid[i][j] = np.random.randint(1, 10)\n            else:\n                # Check if there are any touching objects that are part of the same object as the current pixel\n                touching_objects = []\n                for k in range(-1, 2):\n                    for l in range(-1, 2):\n                        if k!= 0 or l!= 0:\n                            x = i + k\n                            y = j + l\n                            if 0 <= x < len(input_grid) and 0 <= y < len(input_grid[0]) and input_grid[x][y]!= 0:\n                                touching_objects.append((x, y))\n                if len(touching_objects) > 0:\n                    # Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the same value as the current pixel\n                    obj_id = -1\n                    for x, y in touching_objects:\n                        if input_grid[x][y]!= 0 and input_grid[x][y]!= output_grid[i][j]:\n                            obj_id = x\n                            break\n                    if obj_id!= -1:\n                        output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[obj_id][j]\n                else:\n                    # Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random non-zero value\n                    output_grid[i][j] = np.random.randint(1, 10)\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input grid is a 2D NumPy array, where each element represents a pixel and has a value ranging from 0 to 9."
