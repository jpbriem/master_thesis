prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 9, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 4, 9, 2, 8]]

Example_2:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 4, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 4, 2, 0, 6], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 2, 0, 0], [8, 4, 2, 0, 0], [8, 4, 2, 0, 6]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 8, 6], [1, 0, 0, 0, 6], [1, 3, 0, 8, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 8, 6], [1, 3, 4, 8, 6]]



Test case:
input: [[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 6, 1]]

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into an output grid based on certain rules or patterns. The input and output grids represent images with values ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and other values represent different pixel colors. The transformation may involve manipulating the geometry and topology of the input grid, such as lines, rectangles, symmetry, scaling, and containing/being contained. It may also involve manipulating objects within the grid, such as changing their color, size, position, and shape. Additionally, arithmetic operations based on objects or shapes may be involved.

To complete this task, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Test Case Input Copy: Copy the test case input grid from the task description. In this case, the input grid is [[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 6, 1]].
2. Test Case Grid View: Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns. In this case, the input grid has four rows and four columns. The first row contains a single pixel with value 5, the second row contains three pixels with values 7, 6, and 0, respectively, the third row contains two pixels with values 0 and 1, respectively, and the fourth row contains two pixels with values 0 and 6, respectively. There does not appear to be any specific pattern in the input grid.
3. Test Case Object View: Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, and movement, shape, and object number. In this case, there do not appear to be any distinct objects within the input grid. Each pixel has a unique color and size, but they are not grouped together in a way that would form an object.
4. Test Case Transformation: Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed. In this case, the task description does not provide enough information to determine how the input grid should be transformed. Additional details about the desired output grid and any specific rules or patterns that should be applied are needed.
5. Test Case Output: Create the resulting output grid as a numpy array. Once the desired transformation has been determined, you can create the output grid using numpy functions. For example, if the task requires the input grid to be flipped horizontally, you could use the numpy function `fliplr` to achieve this.
