prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Overall pattern:

The input-output relationship is such that each object in the input grid has a corresponding object in the output grid, but with some modifications. The modifications include changing the color, size, position, and shape of the objects. Additionally, there may be new objects added or existing objects removed from the output grid.

Instructions:

To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:

1. For each object in the input grid, check if it exists in the output grid. If it does, update its properties (color, size, position, etc.) according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
2. If an object in the input grid does not exist in the output grid, add a new object with the appropriate properties.
3. If an object in the input grid has been removed, remove it from the output grid.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all objects in the input grid.

Test case input copy:
```python
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]
```
Test case grid view:
Regarding the test input, the entire grid consists of 8 rows and 5 columns. There are no patterns visible in the grid.

Test case object view:
Regarding the test input, the objects are:

* Object 1: Color = 0, Size = 0, Coordinates = [0, 0], Movement = None, Shape = None, Number = 1
* Object 2: Color = 3, Size = 0, Coordinates = [0, 0], Movement = None, Shape = None, Number = 1
* Object 3: Color = 0, Size = 0, Coordinates = [0, 0], Movement = None, Shape = None, Number = 1
* Object 4: Color = 3, Size = 0, Coordinates = [0, 0], Movement = None, Shape = None, Number = 1
* Object 5: Color = 0, Size = 0, Coordinates = [0, 0], Movement = None, Shape = None, Number = 1
* Object 6: Color = 0, Size = 0, Coordinates = [0, 0], Movement = None, Shape = None, Number = 1
* Object 7: Color = 0, Size = 0, Coordinates = [0, 0], Movement = None, Shape = None, Number = 1
* Object 8: Color = 3, Size = 0, Coordinates = [0, 0], Movement = None, Shape = None, Number = 1

There are no patterns visible in the objects.

Test case transformation:
To transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to modify the objects as follows:

* Object 1: Change the color to 3, change the size to 7, move the object to the bottom right corner of the grid, and increase the number to 2.
* Object 2: Remove the object from the grid.
* Object 3: Change the color to 0, change the size to 7, move the object to the top left corner of the grid, and decrease the number to 1.
* Object 4: Change the color to 3, change the size to 7, move the object to the bottom left corner of the grid, and increase the number to 2.
* Object 5: Change the color to 0, change the size to 7, move the object to the top right corner of the grid, and decrease the number to 1.
* Object 6: Change the color to 3, change the size to 7, move the object to the bottom right corner of the grid, and increase the number to 2.
* Object 7: Change the color to 0, change the size to 7, move the object to the top left corner of the grid, and decrease the number to 1.
* Object 8: Change the color to 3, change the size to 7, move the object to the bottom left corner of the grid, and increase the number to 2.

The resulting output grid will look like this:
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
