            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Overall pattern:\n\n* The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n* Each pixel in the input grid has a value between 0 and 8 (inclusive), representing a specific color.\n* The output grid also has values between 0 and 8, but some of these values may differ from those in the input grid.\n* The difference between the input and output pixels depends on the presence of certain objects in the input grid.\n* These objects are defined by their color, size, and position.\n* The objects can touch each other horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.\n* The objects can overlap each other, but they cannot completely cover the entire grid.\n* The objects can appear in any order in the input grid.\n* The output grid contains the same number of objects as the input grid, but their positions and sizes may differ.\n* The output grid also contains noise pixels that do not belong to any object.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Iterate through each row of the input grid.\n2. For each row, iterate through each column.\n3. If the current cell is empty (i.e., it does not contain an object), set the corresponding cell in the output grid to the same color as the current cell in the input grid.\n4. If the current cell contains an object, check if there are any adjacent cells that also contain objects.\n5. If there are no adjacent cells that contain objects, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to the same color as the current cell in the input grid.\n6. If there are adjacent cells that contain objects, check if the current cell is part of a larger object (i.e., it shares the same color and position as another object).\n7. If the current cell is part of a larger object, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to the same color as the larger object.\n8. If the current cell is not part of a larger object, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to a random color that is different from the current cell in the input grid.\n9. Repeat steps 4-8 for all rows and columns in the input grid.\n10. Return the output grid as a numpy array.\n\nTest case input copy:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ninput_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n```\nTest case grid view:\n```css\n  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n3  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n4  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n5  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n6  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n7  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n8  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n9  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n10 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n11 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n12 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n13 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n14 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n15 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n16 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n```\nTest case object view:\n```yaml\nObjects:\n- Color: 3\n  Size: 3x3\n  Coordinates: (1, 1) (4, 1) (7, 1)\n- Color: 3\n  Size: 3x3\n  Coordinates: (1, 4) (4, 4) (7, 4)\n```"
