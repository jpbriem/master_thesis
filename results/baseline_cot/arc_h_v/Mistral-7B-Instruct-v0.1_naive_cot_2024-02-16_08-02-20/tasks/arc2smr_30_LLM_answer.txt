prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

To provide more information about each field, I will assume that the input and output grids are represented as two-dimensional arrays of integers, where 0 represents the background color and non-zero values represent different pixel colors.

* `example_1_description`: This section describes the changes between the input and output pixels and objects in Example 1. For example, it could say something like:
	+ Pixel Changes: In the output grid, every pixel has been replaced with a value of 0 except for those that belong to an object. Each object has been shifted horizontally by 1 unit to the right.
	+ Object Changes: There are now three objects in the output grid, compared to two in the input grid. The first object has been moved vertically by 1 unit upwards, while the second object has been moved diagonally from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. The third object has been added to the bottom right corner.
* `example_2_description`: This section provides additional details about Example 2, if necessary.
* `overall_pattern`: This section describes the general pattern used to transform the input grids into output grids. It could say something like:
	+ The input and output grids are related by a set of rules that involve shifting, scaling, and rotation of objects based on their color and surrounding pixels.
* `instructions`: This section provides detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation. It could say something like:
	+ To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:
		1. Identify all objects in the input grid based on their color and surrounding pixels.
		2. For each object, determine its new position and size based on the transformation rules.
		3. Replace the original object with the new object in the output grid.
		4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all objects in the input grid.
* `test_case_input_copy`: This section instructs the user to copy the test case input grid from the task.
* `test_case_grid_view`: This section describes the pixels of the entire grid in the test case, focusing on patterns. It could say something like:
	+ The test case input grid consists of a 2x2 grid of pixels, with the following pattern:
		|   |   |
		|---|---|
		|   |   |
		|---|---|
* `test_case_object_view`: This section describes the objects in the test case, focusing on color, size, coordinates, movement, shape, and object number. It could say something like:
	+ The test case input grid contains two objects:
		1. An object with color 2, located at (0, 0) and occupying a 3x3 region.
		2. An object with color 3, located at (0, 4) and occupying a 1x1 region.
* `test_case_transformation`: This section describes how the grid or objects should be transformed. It could say something like:
	+ To transform the test case input grid into the output grid, apply the following rules:
		1. Shift the first object horizontally by 1 unit to the right.
		2. Rotate the second object clockwise by 90 degrees.
		3. Add a new object with color 4 to the bottom right corner of the grid.
* `test_case_output`: This section provides the resulting output grid as a numpy array.
