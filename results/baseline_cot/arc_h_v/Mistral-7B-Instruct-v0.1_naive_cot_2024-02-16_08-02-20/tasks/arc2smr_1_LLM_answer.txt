prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Example_1 description:

* Pixel changes: In this example, the input and output grids differ in terms of the presence and absence of certain pixels. Specifically, there are several pixels that are present in the input grid but absent in the output grid, and vice versa. For example, the pixel at position (0, 0) has a value of 0 in the input grid but a value of 5 in the output grid. Similarly, the pixel at position (1, 1) has a value of 2 in the input grid but a value of 0 in the output grid. These differences suggest that some sort of filtering or masking operation has been applied to the input grid to produce the output grid.
* Object changes: There do not appear to be any significant changes in the objects between the input and output grids. Each object in the input grid appears to have the same color, size, and coordinates as its corresponding object in the output grid. However, it's worth noting that the objects themselves may have been shifted or rearranged slightly due to the filtering or masking operation described above.

Overall pattern:

In general, the input-output relationship in this task involves applying some kind of filter or mask to the input grid in order to produce the output grid. This could involve removing certain pixels, changing their values, or shifting them around. The specific details of the filtering or masking operation will depend on the particular input and output grids being considered.

Instructions:

To transform the test input grid into its test output grid, you will need to apply the following steps:

1. Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. Iterate over each pixel in the input grid.
3. If the current pixel has a value of 0, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
4. If the current pixel has a value of 1, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
5. If the current pixel has a value of 2, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
6. If the current pixel has a value of 3, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
7. If the current pixel has a value of 4, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
8. If the current pixel has a value of 5, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
9. If the current pixel has a value of 6, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
10. If the current pixel has a value of 7, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
11. If the current pixel has a value of 8, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
12. If the current pixel has a value of 9, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to a random integer between 1 and 9.
13. Repeat steps 2-12 for all pixels in the input grid.
14. Return the output grid.

Test case input copy:

To copy the test case input grid from the task, simply create a new variable and assign it the value of the input grid. For example:
```python
input_grid = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]
```
