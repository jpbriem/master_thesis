prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

{

        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input and output grids differ in terms of the presence and absence of certain pixels. Specifically, the output grid has more pixels than the input grid, and some of these new pixels represent noise or other non-relevant data.",
        "object_changes": "Regarding the first example, there are no significant differences between the input and output objects. All objects present in both grids have the same color, size, coordinates, shape, and number."
    },
    "example_2_description": {
        // Ellipsis
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship for all examples involves adding or removing pixels based on certain criteria. In particular, the output grids always contain more pixels than the input grids, and these additional pixels may represent noise or other irrelevant data. Additionally, the objects present in both grids have the same properties, such as color, size, coordinates, shape, and number.",
    "instructions": "To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:
        1. Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
        2. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
        3. If the current pixel has a value of 0 (i.e., it represents background), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to 0.
        4. Otherwise, if the current pixel has a value greater than 0, generate a random integer between 0 and the maximum possible value for that pixel (excluding the background value).
        5. Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the generated value.
        6. Repeat steps 2-5 for all pixels in the input grid.
        7. Return the output grid.",
    "test_case_input_copy": "Copy the test case input grid from the task.",
    "test_case_grid_view": "Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns. The grid consists of 2 rows and 5 columns, with each row containing 5 pixels. The pixels have values ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and higher values represent different colors. The grid contains several objects, including two circles and a rectangle. The circles are centered at coordinates (0,1) and (1,4), and have radii of 3 pixels. The rectangle is centered at coordinates (0,4) and has a width of 1 pixel and a height of 4 pixels. The objects are colored differently depending on their type (circle or rectangle), but they all have the same size and shape.",
    "test_case_object_view": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number. The grid contains three objects: two circles and a rectangle. The circles are colored differently depending on their type (circle or rectangle), but they all have the same size and shape. The rectangle is also colored differently, but it has a different size and shape compared to the circles. The objects are arranged in a specific way, with the circles touching the rectangle at their edges. The circles move horizontally across the grid, while the rectangle moves vertically.",
    "test_case_transformation": "Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed. To transform the grid, add a new row above the existing rows and fill it with zeros. This will create a larger grid with the same shape as the original grid. To transform the objects, change their colors so that the circle becomes red and the rectangle becomes blue. Additionally, increase the size of the circles and decrease the size of the rectangle. Finally, move the circles to the left and the rectangle to the right.",
