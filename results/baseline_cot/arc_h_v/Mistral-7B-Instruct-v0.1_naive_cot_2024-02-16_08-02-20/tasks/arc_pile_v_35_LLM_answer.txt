prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [4, 0, 0, 8, 5, 0], [4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [4, 0, 0, 8, 5, 0], [4, 0, 6, 8, 5, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 7, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 9, 7, 0, 2]]



Test case:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 6], [8, 3, 4, 6], [8, 3, 4, 0], [0, 3, 4, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the information you requested:

{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In Example_1, the input grid has some noise pixels (e.g., pixel (0, 0) and pixel (4, 0)) that do not belong to any object. These noise pixels will be removed from the output grid. Additionally, the size of some objects may change. For instance, Object_1 was originally size 3 but now it is size 5. This change is due to the fact that the original size did not cover the entire object. In contrast, Object_2 remains unchanged in size. Finally, the position of some objects may also change. For example, Object_3 was originally located at (1, 4), but now it is located at (1, 6). This change is because the original location did not cover the entire object.', 'object_changes': 'In Example_1, the input grid has three objects: Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3. In the output grid, these objects remain mostly unchanged except for their positions. Object_1 moves from (0, 1) to (0, 2), Object_2 moves from (0, 4) to (0, 5), and Object_3 moves from (1, 4) to (1, 6). However, the color and size of these objects remain the same.'},
'example_2_description': 'In Example_2, the input grid has two objects: Object_1 and Object_2. In the output grid, Object_1 remains unchanged, while Object_2 moves from (0, 2) to (0, 3) and gains a new color value of 7. This change is due to the fact that the original position of Object_2 did not cover the entire object, and the new color value is chosen randomly.', 'overall_pattern': 'In general, the input-output relationship in this task involves removing noise pixels, changing the size and position of objects, and possibly changing the color of objects. The specific changes depend on the characteristics of each input grid and the desired output grid.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:

1. Remove any noise pixels from the input grid. A noise pixel is a pixel that does not belong to any object in the input grid.
2. Adjust the size of objects if necessary. If an object's original size did not cover the entire object, increase its size until it covers the entire object.
3. Move objects if necessary. If an object's original position did not cover the entire object, move it until it covers the entire object.
4. Change the color of objects if necessary. If an object's original color does not match the desired color in the output grid, change its color to the desired color.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all objects in the input grid.
6. Combine the adjusted objects and noise pixels to form the output grid.', 'test_case_input_copy': 'Copy the test case input grid from the task description.', 'test_case_grid_view': 'Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.

There are three objects in the input grid. Object_1 is a blue rectangle with size 3, centered at (0, 1). Object_2 is a green rectangle with size 4, centered at (0, 4). Object_3 is a red rectangle with size 3, centered at (1, 2). These objects do not touch each other.', 'test_case_transformation': 'Transform the input grid as follows:

1. Remove the noise pixels.
