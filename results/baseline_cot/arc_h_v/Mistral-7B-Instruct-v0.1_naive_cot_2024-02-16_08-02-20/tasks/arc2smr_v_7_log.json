            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

In each row, the elements of the input grid are transformed according to certain rules. Specifically, if an element of the input grid has value 0 (background), it remains unchanged in the output grid. If an element of the input grid has value 1, then it is replaced with a random value between 2 and 9 in the output grid. Additionally, if two adjacent elements of the input grid have the same value (i.e., they form a connected region), then they are merged into a single region in the output grid. This merging process involves replacing the original elements with a new element that has a value equal to the average of the values of the original elements.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform the test input grid into its test output grid, follow these steps:\n\n1. For each row of the input grid, iterate over the elements of the row.\n2. If an element has value 0, leave it unchanged in the output grid.\n3. If an element has value 1, replace it with a random value between 2 and 9 in the output grid.\n4. If two adjacent elements have the same value, merge them into a single region in the output grid. To do this, calculate the average of the values of the two adjacent elements, and replace both elements with a new element that has this average value.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all rows of the input grid.\n\nTest case input copy:\n```python\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nTest case grid view:\nRegarding the test input, the entire grid consists of 2D arrays of integers. Each element of the grid has a value between 0 and 9, inclusive. There are no noise pixels in the grid.\n\nTest case object view:\nRegarding the test input, there are several objects in the grid. Each object is defined by a set of coordinates and a size. The objects have the following properties:\n\n* Color: Each object has a specific color, represented by an integer value between 1 and 9.\n* Size: Each object has a specific size, represented by an integer value between 1 and 9.\n* Movement: Each object can move horizontally or vertically, depending on its direction. The direction of movement is determined by the sign of the difference between the x-coordinates of the current position and the next position.\n* Number: Each object has a unique identifier, represented by an integer value between 1 and 9.\n\nTest case transformation:\nTo transform the test input grid into its test output grid, follow these steps:\n\n1. For each row of the input grid, iterate over the elements of the row.\n2. If an element has value 0, leave it unchanged in the output grid.\n3. If an element has value 1, replace it with a random value between 2 and 9 in the output grid.\n4. If two adjacent elements have the same value, merge them into a single region in the output grid. To do this, calculate the average of the values of the two adjacent elements, and replace both elements with a new element that has this average value.\n5.
