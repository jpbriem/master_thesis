prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Overall pattern:

The input-output pairs provided show that the transformation involves replacing certain pixels with specific values based on their surrounding pixels. In particular, the transformation replaces pixels with value 0 (background) with pixels having a higher value (color). This replacement occurs when two adjacent pixels have the same color. Additionally, the transformation also replaces pixels with value 7 (white) with pixels having a lower value (black), but only if they are surrounded by black pixels.

Instructions:

To perform the transformation, follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. For each row, iterate through each column.
3. If the current pixel has value 0 (background), check if it has two adjacent pixels with the same color. If so, replace the current pixel with the average of the three pixels.
4. If the current pixel has value 7 (white), check if it is surrounded by black pixels. If so, replace the current pixel with value 0 (background). Otherwise, leave the pixel unchanged.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all rows and columns in the input grid.

Test case input copy:
```python
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Test case grid view:

The input grid consists of 2D arrays where each element represents a pixel color. The grid has dimensions [2, 5]. There are four objects in the grid:

* Object\_1: Color = '2', Coordinates = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1]], Size = 3
* Object\_2: Color = '3', Coordinates = [[0, 4]], Size = 1
* Object\_3: Color = '2', Coordinates = [[1, 4]], Size = 1

Overall, there are six pixels with color '2' and three pixels with color '3'.

Test case object view:

Objects in the input grid are defined based on their color and size. Each object has a unique identifier (e.g., Object\_1, Object\_2, etc.). Objects are represented using dictionaries containing information about their color, coordinates, and size.

For example, Object\_1 has the following properties:

* Color = '2'
* Coordinates = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1]]
* Size = 3

Similarly, Object\_2 and Object\_3 have the following properties:

* Object\_2: Color = '3', Coordinates = [[0, 4]], Size = 1
* Object\_3: Color = '2', Coordinates = [[1, 4]], Size = 1

Test case transformation:

The transformation involves replacing certain pixels with specific values based on their surrounding pixels. In particular, the transformation replaces pixels with value 0 (background) with pixels having a higher value (color). This replacement occurs when two adjacent pixels have the same color. Additionally, the transformation also replaces pixels with value 7 (white) with pixels having a lower value (black), but only if they are surrounded by black pixels.

For example, consider the following input grid:
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
After applying the transformation, we get the following output grid:
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
As you can see, the transformation replaced some pixels with specific values based on their surrounding pixels. For example, the pixel at position (1, 1) was changed from color '2' to color '7' because it had two adjacent pixels with color '2'. Similarly, the pixel at position (4, 4) was changed from color '3' to color '0
