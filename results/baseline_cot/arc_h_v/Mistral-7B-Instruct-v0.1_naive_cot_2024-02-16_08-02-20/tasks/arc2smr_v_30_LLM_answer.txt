prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

To provide more information about each field, I will assume that the input and output grids are represented as two-dimensional arrays of integers, where 0 represents the background color and non-zero values represent different pixel colors.

* `example_1_description`: This section describes the changes between the input and output pixels and objects in Example 1. For example, it could say something like:
	+ Pixel Changes: In the output grid, every pixel has been replaced with a value of 7 if it was originally 2, and every other pixel remains unchanged.
	+ Object Changes: There are no changes in the object positions or sizes in the output grid compared to the input grid. However, the color of every object has been changed to 7.
* `example_2_description`: This section provides an ellipsis since there is no additional information provided in the example.
* `overall_pattern`: This section describes the general pattern used to transform the input grids into output grids. It could say something like:
	+ The overall pattern involves replacing certain pixel values with new values based on their original values and surrounding pixels.
* `instructions`: This section provides detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation. It could say something like:
	+ Start by iterating through each pixel in the input grid.
	+ If the current pixel has a value of 2, replace it with a value of 7.
	+ If the current pixel has a value of 0, check the values of its neighboring pixels.
	+ If any of the neighboring pixels have a value of 2, replace the current pixel with a value of 7.
	+ If none of the neighboring pixels have a value of 2, leave the current pixel unchanged.
* `test_case_input_copy`: This section provides instructions on how to copy the test case input grid. It could say something like:
	+ Create a copy of the input grid using the `numpy.array()` function.
* `test_case_grid_view`: This section provides a description of the pixels in the entire grid of the test case input. It could say something like:
	+ The test case input grid has dimensions 5x5 and contains the following pixels:
		- (0, 0): 2
		- (0, 1): 2
		- (0, 2): 2
		- (0, 3): 2
		- (0, 4): 2
		- (1, 0): 2
		- (1, 1): 2
		- (1, 2): 2
		- (1, 3): 2
		- (1, 4): 2
		- (2, 0): 2
		- (2, 1): 2
		- (2, 2): 2
		- (2, 3): 2
		- (2, 4): 2
		- (3, 0): 2
		- (3, 1): 2
		- (3, 2): 2
		- (3, 3): 2
		- (3, 4): 2
		- (4, 0): 2
		- (4, 1): 2
		- (4, 2): 2
		- (4, 3): 2
		- (4, 4): 2
		- (5, 0): 2
		- (5, 1): 2
		- (5, 2): 2
		- (5, 3): 2
		- (5, 4): 2
* `test_case_object_view`: This section provides a description of the objects in the test case input. It could say something like:
	+ The test case input grid contains the following objects:
		- Object 1: Color = 2, Coordinates = ((0, 1), (0, 2)), Size = 3
		- Object 2: Color = 3, Coordinates = ((0, 4)), Size = 1
		- Object 3: Color = 2, Coordinates = ((1, 4)), Size = 1
* `test_case_transformation`: This section provides details on how the grid or objects should be transformed. It could say something like:
	+ To transform the grid, replace every pixel with a value of 7 if it was originally 2, and leave all other pixels unchanged.
	+ To transform the objects, change the color of every object to 7.
* `test_case_output`: This section provides instructions on how to create the resulting output grid as a numpy array. It could say something like:
	+ Create a new numpy array with the same dimensions as the input grid.
	+ Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
		- If the current pixel has a value of 2, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to 7.
		- If the current pixel has a value of 0, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to 0.
