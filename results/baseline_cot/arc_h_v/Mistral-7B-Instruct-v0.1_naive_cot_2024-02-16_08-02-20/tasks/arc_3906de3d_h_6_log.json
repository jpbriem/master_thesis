            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

In this case, the input and output grids represent the same image, but with some modifications applied to the objects.\n\nHere's an explanation of each field:\n\n* `example_1_description`: This section describes the changes made to the input pixels and objects in Example 1. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ Pixel changes: In the output grid, every pixel has been replaced with a new value based on its position relative to the objects in the input grid. Pixels that are part of an object have been set to a specific color (e.g., red), while pixels outside of any object have been set to black.\n\t+ Object changes: There are two objects in the input grid: a square with a blue border and a circle with a green border. In the output grid, these objects have been moved to different positions and their sizes have been adjusted. The square now has a larger area, while the circle has been shrunken. Additionally, the colors of the objects have been changed: the square is now yellow, and the circle is now orange.\n* `example_2_description`: This section would contain a description of Example 2, if there was one. It would follow the same format as Example 1, describing the changes made to the input pixels and objects.\n* `overall_pattern`: This section provides a general description of the input-output relationship that applies to all input-output pairs. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ The input and output grids represent the same image, but with some modifications applied to the objects. Specifically, the objects have been moved and resized, and their colors have been changed.\n* `instructions`: This section provides detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:\n\t\t1. Loop through each pixel in the input grid.\n\t\t2. If the pixel is part of an object, set its value to the corresponding color (red for squares, blue for circles).\n\t\t3. If the pixel is outside of any object, set its value to black.\n\t\t4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all pixels in the input grid.\n* `test_case_input_copy`: This section provides instructions on how to copy the test case input grid from the task. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ To copy the test case input grid, simply create a new empty grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and then loop through each pixel in the input grid, setting the corresponding pixel in the new grid to the same value.\n* `test_case_grid_view`: This section provides a description of the pixels in the entire grid, focusing on patterns. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ The input grid consists of 2 rows and 5 columns"
