prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

To provide more information about each field, I will assume that the input and output grids follow the same pattern as the provided examples. In this case, the overall pattern is that the input and output grids differ only in their pixel values. Specifically, the input grid has some noise pixels (i.e., pixels with random values) while the output grid has all pixels set to the background color (i.e., value 0).

Here are the descriptions for each field:

* `example_1_description`: This section describes the changes between the input and output pixels and objects in the first example. For the pixels, we can say that the noise pixels in the input grid have been replaced with the background color in the output grid. For the objects, we can say that there are no objects in the input grid, but there are two objects in the output grid. One object has color 2, size 3, and coordinates [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1)]. The other object has color 3, size 1, and coordinates [(0, 4)].
* `example_2_description`: This section is empty because there are no additional examples provided.
* `overall_pattern`: This section provides an overview of the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs. Based on the provided examples, we can say that the input and output grids differ only in their pixel values, specifically in the presence or absence of noise pixels.
* `instructions`: This section provides detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation. To transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to replace all noise pixels with the background color. We can do this by iterating over each pixel in the input grid and checking if it has a random value. If it does, we set it to the background color; otherwise, we leave it unchanged.
* `test_case_input_copy`: This section suggests copying the test case input grid from the task. This is just a suggestion and may not always be necessary.
* `test_case_grid_view`: This section suggests describing the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns. In the case of the test input grid, we can say that there are four rows and five columns, and that the pixels alternate between having a random value and the background color.
* `test_case_object_view`: This section suggests describing the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number. In the case of the test input grid, there are no objects.
* `test_case_transformation`: This section suggests describing how the grid or objects should be transformed. As mentioned earlier, we can transform the input grid into the output grid by replacing all noise pixels with the background color.
* `test_case_output`: This section suggests creating the resulting output grid as a numpy array. This is just a suggestion and may not always be necessary.
