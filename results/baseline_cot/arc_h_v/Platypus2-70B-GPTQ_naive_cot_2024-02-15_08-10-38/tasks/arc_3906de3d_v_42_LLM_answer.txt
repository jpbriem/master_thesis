prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:

{

        'pixel_changes': 'In this example, we observe that the top left corner of the input grid has been changed to reflect the bottom right corner of the original image. This change is consistent throughout each row and column, so it appears that some sort of rotation or reflection may be taking place. Additionally, there seems to be an overall shift towards lighter tones in both directions (top/bottom & left/right). Finally, note how certain areas remain unchanged despite these transformations - specifically those containing no data whatsoever! These could represent empty spaces where nothing needs updating due to lack of information provided by our source material.'

        'pixel_changes': 'This second example shows us another instance where the top left corner gets replaced with content found elsewhere in the picture; however now instead of simply flipping horizontally like before, it also shifts vertically upwards slightly while doing so! Again though you'll see many spots stay exactly identical since they don't contain any meaningful details worth altering.'
    },
    'example_3_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'Finally here comes yet again one more variation upon previous ones but now involving diagonal movements rather than just horizontal/vertical ones alone... As expected once more particular regions stay intact because why bother messing around when there isn't anything significant present?'
    },
    'overall_pattern': 'It looks like whatever process was used here involves replacing parts of images using other pieces taken from somewhere else within said image itself. Sometimes this replacement happens along straight lines (horizontal/vertical) whereas sometimes it occurs diagonally across multiple axes simultaneously. Regardless though certain portions always seem immune against such manipulations likely due them having little relevance anyway.'
   ,
    'instructions': 'To perform this operation yourself follow these steps: \n\n1) Identify which portion(s) need(s) swapping out.\n2) Determine whether said swap will occur along either axis separately OR together via diagonal motion.\n3) Replace identified section(s) accordingly.\n4) Repeat until desired result achieved!'

All three items occupy different sizes ranging anywhere from 1 unit wide/high up through 9 units respectively.'
