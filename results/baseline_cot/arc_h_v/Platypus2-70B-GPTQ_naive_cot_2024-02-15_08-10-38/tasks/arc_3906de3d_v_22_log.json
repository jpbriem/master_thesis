            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

Firstly, some pixels change their value from 4 to 9 (or vice versa). Secondly, some pixels change their position horizontally or vertically. For instance, in the top left corner, the four pixels with value 4 move one unit rightward while maintaining their original order. Similarly, in the bottom right corner, the three pixels with value 4 move one unit upward while keeping their relative positions unchanged.',\n        'object_changes': 'Regarding the first example, there are no objects present in either the input or output grids. Therefore, no object changes occur.',\n    },\n    'example_2_description': {\n        'pixel_changes': 'In the second example, there are also two types of changes that occur between the input and output pixels. Firstly, some pixels change their value from 4 to 9 (or vice versa). Secondly, some pixels change their position horizontally or vertically. However, compared to the first example, these movements differ slightly. In this case, instead of moving one unit like before, each group of four consecutive pixels with value 4 moves two units horizontally or vertically depending on where they lie within the grid. For instance, near the center of the grid, we observe groups of four consecutive pixels with value 4 shifting two units rightward and then two units downward respectively. On the other hand, towards the edges of the grid, such groups may shift differently due to boundary constraints. Overall though, regardless of location within the grid, every group consisting of four consecutive pixels with value 4 always moves exactly two units along both axes simultaneously.',\n        'object_changes': 'Similar to the previous example, there are no objects present in either the input or output grids here so no object changes take place.',\n    },\n    'example_3_description': {\n        'pixel_changes': 'Finally, in the third example, once again we see two types of changes occurring between input and output pixels - some changing values from 4 to 9 (or vice versa) while others undergo horizontal/vertical displacements. This time however, rather than having fixed distances like before, each group containing multiple consecutive pixels with value 4 now moves varying amounts depending upon what part(s) of the overall structure it occupies. Specifically speaking, if located anywhere except directly above/below another similarly sized block made entirely out of zeros (i.e., empty spaces), any given set composed solely out of ones will always travel precisely halfway across whatever gap separates itself from whichever neighbor lies closest geographically speaking; meanwhile those residing immediately next door to nothingness simply remain stationary altogether! It's worth noting too that although certain regions appear visually identical when comparing inputs versus outputs side-by-side initially...upon closer inspection one quickly realizes subtle yet significant differences exist nonetheless thanks largely in part due primarily because unlike previously mentioned scenarios involving static blocks filled exclusively full w/ones...here instead we find ourselves dealing w/dynamic configurations capable adapting dynamically according various external stimuli thereby allowing us greater flexibility control over final outcome ultimately achieved
