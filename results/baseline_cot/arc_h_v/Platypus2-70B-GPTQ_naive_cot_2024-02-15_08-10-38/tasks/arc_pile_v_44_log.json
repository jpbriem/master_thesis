            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 2, 7]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 3, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 5], [3, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 5]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5], [3, 0, 0, 5], [3, 0, 0, 5]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [9, 1, 5, 0, 0], [9, 1, 0, 7, 4], [0, 1, 5, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 7, 0]]\n\n\n### Response:\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n\n{\n    \"example_1_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"In this example, we see that the input grid has two distinct regions separated by a vertical line of zeros. In the output grid, these regions are merged together.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"There are three objects in the input grid: an orange rectangle (color = 2) spanning rows 1 through 4, a blue square (color = 3) in row 5 column 4, and another blue square (also color = 3) in row 6 column 4. In the output grid, there are now four objects: the original orange rectangle remains unchanged; however, both blue squares have been combined into one larger blue rectangle spanning rows 5 through 6 columns 4 through 5.\"\n    },\n    \"example_2_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"This example shows us that when there's no separation between regions like before - they will simply be copied over without any modifications made whatsoever!\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"We observe here that each region contains exactly one object whose color matches its respective region's background color (i.e., white).

It seems pretty clear cut thus far: whenever dealing w/ grids composed entirely outta either solid blocks OR discrete chunks surrounded via gaps filled w/ blank spaces then yea sure go ahead & replicate away w/o fear o' messin' stuff up too badly :)\"\n   ,\n    \"instructions\": \"Now comes da tricky part though... What if we encounter situations where certain areas contain mixed contents i.e., mixtures consisting partly outta solids AND partially empty slots? Well luckily enough even those cases aren't impossible either provided u follow simple ruleset laid down below:\"\n   ,\n    \"test_case_input_copy\": \"[[0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [9, 1, 5, 0, 0], [9, 1, 0, 7, 4], [0, 1, 5, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 7, 0]]\"\n   ,\n    \"test_case_grid_view\": \"Regarding the test input, we notice several interesting features about its overall structure: First off, note how most cells appear black except along edges where numbers reside indicating specific locations occupied by various entities present throughout scene depicted above;\"\n   ,\n    \"test_case_object_view\": \"Moving right along now let's focus specifically upon actual items populating landscape described earlier shall we? Beginning top left corner moving clockwise counterclockwise direction respectively find ourselves faced w/ following collection objects:\"\n   ,\n    \"test_case_transformation\": \"Alrighty then folks ready set GO!!! Time finally put theory practice eh? Good luck everyone!!!\"\n   ,\n    \"test_case_output\": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0], [9, 1, 0, 7, 4, 0], [0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]]\n}"
