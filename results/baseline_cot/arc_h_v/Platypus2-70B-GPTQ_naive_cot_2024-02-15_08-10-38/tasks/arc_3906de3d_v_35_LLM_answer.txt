prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:

{
    'example_1_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'In this example, we see that there are two main areas of interest: an area of blue (value = 4) and an area of red (value = 7). There are also some black pixels (value = 0), but they do not seem to play any significant role in the overall picture.',
        'object_changes': 'Regarding the objects, we notice that there is a large blue square in the center of the image, surrounded by smaller squares of various sizes. Some of these smaller squares are touching each other, while others are isolated. We also observe that there are several red dots scattered throughout the scene, most likely representing people or animals. Finally, it appears that some parts of the landscape may be obscured by fog or mist, indicated by white patches near the top left corner.'
    },
    'example_2_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'This example shows us another instance where there is both blue and red present in the image. However, unlike before, here we find three distinct regions instead of just two: one region containing mostly blues; another region consisting primarily of reds; and finally, a third region made up entirely out of whites/greys. Additionally, we note that although many small details remain unchanged across all three regions (such as grassy hillsides), certain elements appear differently depending upon their location relative to either side'
       ,
        'object_changes': 'With respect to objects, once again we encounter numerous instances of both blue and red entities occupying various positions within our field-of-view. Furthermore, due to differences in lighting conditions between each region mentioned earlier, some objects become more visible than others when viewed under specific circumstances.'
    },
    'example_3_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'Here we come across yet another variation involving multiple shades of blue mixed together along with occasional bursts of bright pink hue popping up every now & then. As far as I can tell, no major alterations took place compared to previous cases except perhaps slight adjustments regarding contrast levels.'
       ,
        'object_changes': 'As usual, plenty of diverse creatures roam around freely throughout space - ranging anywhere from tiny insects crawling along ground surfaces all way up towards majestic birds soaring high above skies!'
    },
    'overall_pattern': 'Overall, it seems like regardless what kind environment you put yourself into – whether urban jungle filled w/ concrete buildings towering over head OR rural countryside covered lush greenery stretching miles away – chances are good you’ll always end finding common denominator shared amongst them i.e., presence vibrant lifeforms inhabiting respective ecosystem(s)!'
