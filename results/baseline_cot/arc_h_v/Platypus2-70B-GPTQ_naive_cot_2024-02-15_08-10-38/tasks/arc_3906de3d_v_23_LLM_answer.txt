prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:

{
    'example_1_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'In this example, we observe that the top left corner of the image has been changed from white (value = 7) to black (value = 0). Additionally, there are some other minor changes throughout the rest of the image.',
        'object_changes': 'Regarding the objects, we see that they remain unchanged except for their color. They still occupy the same positions and have the same sizes as before.'
    },
    'example_2_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'This example shows us that the top left corner of the image has also been altered here - it now contains a mixture of both white (value = 7) and black (value = 0) pixels instead of just pure white ones like in Example 1. Furthermore, there appear to be more significant modifications made across various parts of this particular instance compared to what was observed previously.',
        'object_changes': 'As far as objects go, these too seem unaffected by any sort of modification; however, their colors may differ slightly due to differences in lighting conditions present during capture time.'
    },
    'example_3_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'Finally, our third example demonstrates yet another variation whereby certain areas near the center portion contain mixed shades consisting primarily out of darker hues such as gray/black while others maintain lighter tones including yellowish-white etc... Moreover, noticeable adjustments can once again be seen scattered around several regions throughout this picture when contrasted against earlier instances mentioned above.'
       ,'object_changes': 'Lastly, no major alterations were detected regarding object placement nor dimensions but slight discrepancies could potentially exist concerning respective hue values associated with each item depicted herein.'
    },
    'overall_pattern': 'Overall, it appears that regardless of whether an area consists solely out of either completely filled up spaces containing only one type of color OR partially empty spots featuring multiple distinct shades side-by-side – both scenarios result in identical outputs after undergoing said transformation process(es). This suggests strongly enough evidence pointing towards some form(s) of automated algorithm(s) being utilized behind scenes responsible for carrying out said tasks efficiently without fail everytime.'
   ,'instructions': 'To summarize briefly then: given any arbitrary input matrix X whose elements range anywhere between 0 <= x < ∞ ; simply replace every element found equaling exactly 7 with value 0 otherwise leave untouched.'

There are also two groups of eight consecutive black pixels arranged vertically starting from row index 6 and ending at row indices 7 & 8 respectively.'
   ,'test_case_object_view': 'There do not appear to be any objects present within this specific scenario since none meet criteria specified earlier i.e., having at least three adjacent cells sharing same color AND occupying contiguous space horizontally/vertically speaking.'
   ,'test_case_transformation': 'Given the provided information thus far, it seems reasonable to assume that no further action needs taken beyond replacing those particular elements currently holding value 7 with zeros instead.'
