prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:

{
    'example_1_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'In this example, we see that there is a line of eight pixels (value = 8) running horizontally across the top half of the image. There are also two vertical lines of eight pixels each, one starting from the left edge and ending near the center, and another starting from the right edge and ending near the center. In addition, there are some isolated eight-valued pixels scattered throughout the rest of the image.',
        'object_changes': 'Regarding the objects, we observe that there is an object consisting of a horizontal row of eight pixels spanning the width of the image. Additionally, there are three other objects - two vertical rows of eight pixels each, one starting from the left side and ending near the middle, while the other starts from the right side and ends near the middle; and finally, a single isolated eight-valued pixel located somewhere in the image.'
    },
    'example_2_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'This example shows a series of horizontal and vertical lines made up of eight-valued pixels. Starting from the top left corner, there is a horizontal line of eight pixels followed by four more horizontal lines below it. To the right of these five horizontal lines, there is a vertical line of eight pixels extending downwards until it reaches the bottom of the image. After this vertical line, there are two more horizontal lines above it and then another vertical line below them. Finally, there is a small section containing several isolated eight-valued pixels towards the end of the image.',
        'object_changes': 'There are six distinct objects present in this example: five horizontal rows and one vertical column, all composed entirely out of eight-valued pixels. The first object consists of a single horizontal row located at the very top left corner; next comes four additional horizontal rows directly beneath it; afterward appears a lone vertical column situated slightly off center; then follow two further horizontal rows positioned just above said column; lastly lies yet another solitary vertical column found near the lower portion of the picture.'
    },
    'example_3_description': {
        'pixel_changes': 'In this example, we can see a large area filled with eight-valued pixels arranged in various directions. Starting from the top left corner, there is a long horizontal line of eight-valued pixels stretching almost all the way across the image. Below this line, there are two shorter vertical columns of eight-valued pixels going downwards. Following these columns, there is another longer horizontal row of eight-valued pixels running along most of the remaining space. Lastly, towards the bottom right corner, there is a smaller region where some isolated eight-valued pixels appear scattered around.'
       ,'object_changes': 'We observe seven distinct objects in total: one big horizontal row occupying much of the upper part; two medium sized vertical columns standing side by side underneath it; another extensive horizontal row taking up nearly everything else except for a tiny patch at the far end containing few scattered eight-valued pixels.'
    },
    'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve groups of connected eight-valued pixels forming either straight lines or blocks/clusters. These groups may vary greatly in terms of their sizes and orientations but they always consist exclusively out of eight-valued elements.'
