            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [8, 0, 9, 3, 0, 7], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [8, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0], [8, 6, 9, 3, 0, 7]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 5, 6]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 5, 6]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 3, 8, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 9, 7, 4], [0, 3, 8, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 4], [0, 3, 8, 9, 7, 4], [0, 3, 8, 9, 7, 4]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\noutput: [[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]\n\n\n\n### Example_1\n\nDescribing the input-output relationship regarding the first example, describing the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes.\n\nThe input grid has five rows and four columns. It contains nine distinct pixel colors (from 1 to 9) and zero background color. There are two objects: Object_1 and Object_2. Object_1 consists of three adjacent pixels of color 2. Object_2 consists of one adjacent pixel of color 3.\n\nThe output grid also has five rows and four columns. It contains nine distinct pixel colors (from 1 to 9) and zero background color. There are two objects: Object_1 and Object_2. Object_1 consists of three adjacent pixels of color 2. Object_2 consists of one adjacent pixel of color 3.\n\nThe input grid is transformed into the output grid using the following rules:\n\n- All pixels that belong to an object remain unchanged.\n- Pixels that do not belong to any object are changed according to their distance to the nearest neighboring object. If there are multiple such neighbors, then they are chosen randomly.\n\nThe rule is applied recursively until no more changes occur.\n\n\n### Example_2\n\nDescribing the input-output relationship regarding the second example, describing the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.\n\nThe input grid has six rows and seven columns. It contains eight distinct pixel colors (from 1 to 8). There are two objects: Object_1 and Object_2. Object_1 consists of two adjacent pixels of color 1. Object_2 consists of one adjacent pixel of color 2.\n\nThe output grid also has six rows and seven columns. It contains eight distinct pixel colors (from 1 to 8). There are two objects: Object_1 and Object_2. Object_1 consists of two adjacent pixels of color 1. Object_2 consists of one adjacent pixel of color 2.\n\nThe input grid is transformed into the output grid using the following rules:\n\n- All pixels that belong to an object remain unchanged.\n- Pixels that do not belong to any object are changed according to their distance to the nearest neighboring object.

It contains nine distinct pixel colors (from 1 to 9) and zero background color. There are two objects: Object_1 and Object_2. Object_1 consists of three adjacent pixels of color 2. Object_2 consists of one adjacent pixel of color 3.\n\nThe output grid also has five rows and four columns. It contains nine distinct pixel colors (from 1 to 9) and zero background color.
