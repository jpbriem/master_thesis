            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 3, 0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]]\noutput: [[3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 1, 1, 1], [9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[1, 1, 1, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[3, 0, 3, 3], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 4, 0]]\noutput: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]]\n\n\n\n### Example_1 description\n\nRegarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes.\n\nThe input grid has five rows and four columns. It contains seven black squares (objects) and two white ones. The black squares are arranged in a line along the top row, then in a line along the bottom row, then in a line across the middle column, then in a line across the rightmost column. The white squares are located in the center of each row and column.\n\nThe output grid also has five rows and four columns. It contains six black squares and three white ones. The black squares are arranged in a line along the top row, then in a line along the bottom row, then in a line across the middle column, then in a line across the leftmost column. The white squares are located in the center of each row and column.\n\nThe pattern of the input grid is preserved in the output grid. However, some of the objects were moved around. For instance, the object that was previously in the second row, third column now appears in the fourth row, fifth column.\n\n### Example_2 description\n\nRegarding the second example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.\n\nThe input grid has five rows and four columns. It contains nine black squares (objects). Each square occupies an entire row or column. There are no white squares.\n\nThe output grid also has five rows and four columns. It contains eight black squares and one white one. The white square occupies the center of the last row and column.\n\nThe pattern of the input grid is preserved in the output grid. However, some of the objects were moved around.

One of them occupies the center of the last row and column.\n\nThe pattern of the input grid is preserved in the output grid. However, some of the objects were moved around.
