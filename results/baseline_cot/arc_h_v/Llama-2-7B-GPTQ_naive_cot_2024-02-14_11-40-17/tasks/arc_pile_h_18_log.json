            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 7], [8, 0, 8, 0]]\noutput: [[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3]]\noutput: [[9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[5, 5, 0, 5], [0, 7, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4], [0, 6, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\noutput: [[5, 5, 0, 5], [0, 7, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4], [0, 6, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\n### Example_1\n\nRegarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes.\n\nThe input grid has four objects: two lines (objects A and B) and two rectangles (objects C and D).\nObjects A and B are connected via their left ends. They both contain three noise pixels each.\nObjects C and D are also connected via their right ends. They both contain five noise pixels each.\n\nThe output grid contains four objects again: two lines (objects A' and B') and two rectangles (objects C' and D').\nThey are identical to the original objects except that they are shifted vertically upwards by one pixel.\nThis means that the top line now starts at position 1 instead of position 0.\n\nThe objects are still connected via their left ends. However, this time it is objects A' and B'.\nBoth objects contain six noise pixels each.\n\nThe objects are still connected via their right ends. This time it is objects C' and D'.\nBoth objects contain seven noise pixels each.\n\n\n\n### Example_2\n\nRegarding the second example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes.\n\nThe input grid has eight objects: four lines (objects A through D), two rectangles (objects E and F), and two triangles (objects G and H).\nAll objects are connected via their left ends.\n\nThe output grid contains nine objects: four lines (objects A' through D'), two rectangles (objects E' and F'), and two triangles (objects G' and H').\nThey are identical to the original objects except that they are shifted horizontally leftward by one pixel.\nThis means that the bottom line now starts at position 8 instead of position 7.\n\nThe objects are still connected via their left ends. However, this time it is objects A' through D'.\nBoth objects contain ten noise pixels each.\n\nThe objects are still connected via their right ends. This time it is objects E' and F'.\nBoth objects contain eleven noise pixels each.\n\n\n\n### Example_3\n\nRegarding the third example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes.\n\nThe input grid has twelve objects: four lines (objects A through D), four rectangles (objects E through H), and four triangles (objects I through L).\nAll objects are connected via their left ends.\n\nThe output grid contains twelve objects: four lines (objects A' through D'), four rectangles (objects E' through H'), and four triangles (objects I' through L').\nThey are identical to the original objects except that they are shifted horizontally leftward by one pixel.\nThis means that the bottom line now starts at position 11 instead of position 10.\n\nThe objects are still connected via their left ends. However, this time it is objects A' through D'.\nBoth objects contain thirteen noise pixels each.\n\nThe objects are still connected via their right ends. This time it is objects E' and F'.\nBoth objects contain fifteen noise pixels each.\n\n\n\n### Test Case Input Grid View\n\nRegarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.\n\nThe input grid consists of four objects: two lines (objects A and B) and two rectangles (objects C and D).\nObjects A and B are connected via their left ends. Both objects contain three noise pixels each.\nObjects C and D are also connected via their right ends. Both objects contain five noise pixels each.\n\n\n\n### Test Case Output Grid View\n\nRegarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.\n\nThe output grid contains four objects again: two lines (objects A' and B') and two rectangles (objects C' and D').\nThey are identical to the original objects except that they are shifted vertically upwards by one pixel.\nThis means that the top line now starts at position 1 instead of position 0.\n\nThe objects are still connected via their left ends. However, this time it is objects A' and B'.\nBoth objects contain six noise pixels each.\n\nThe objects are still connected via their right ends. This time it is objects C' and D'.\nBoth objects contain seven noise pixels each.\n\n\n\n### Test Case Transformation\n\nDescribe how the grid or objects should be transformed.\n\nThe input grid should be transformed so that the objects are shifted vertically upwards by one pixel.\n\n\n\n### Test Case Output\n\nCreate the resulting output grid as numpy array.\n\nThe output grid is identical to the input grid."
