prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 1, 1, 1], [9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 1, 1, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[3, 0, 3, 3], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 4, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]]

Sample Outputs:
output: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]]



### Example_1 description

Regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes.

The input grid has five rows and four columns. It contains seven black squares (objects) and two white ones. The black squares are arranged in a line along the top row, then in a line along the bottom row, then in a line across the middle column, then in a line across the rightmost column. The white squares are located in the center of each row and column.

The output grid also has five rows and four columns. It contains six black squares and three white ones. The black squares are arranged in a line along the top row, then in a line along the bottom row, then in a line across the middle column, then in a line across the leftmost column. The white squares are located in the center of each row and column.

The pattern of the input grid is preserved in the output grid. However, some of the objects were moved around. For instance, the object that was previously in the second row, third column now appears in the fourth row, fifth column.

### Example_2 description

Regarding the second example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.

The input grid has five rows and four columns. It contains nine black squares (objects). Each square occupies an entire row or column. There are no white squares.

The output grid also has five rows and four columns. It contains eight black squares and one white one. The white square occupies the center of the last row and column.

The pattern of the input grid is preserved in the output grid. However, some of the objects were moved around. For instance, the object that was previously in the second row, third column now appears in the fourth row, fifth column.

### Test_case_input_copy

Copy the test case input grid from the task.

### Test_case_grid_view

Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.

The input grid has five rows and four columns. It contains seven black squares (objects), one gray rectangle, and one white square. The black squares are arranged in a line along the top row, then in a line along the bottom row, then in a line across the middle column, then in a line across the rightmost column. The gray rectangle occupies the center of the second row and column. The white square occupies the center of the last row and column.

The output grid also has five rows and four columns. It contains six black squares, one gray rectangle, and one white square. The black squares are arranged in a line along the top row, then in a line along the bottom row, then in a line across the middle column, then in a line across the leftmost column. The gray rectangle occupies the center of the second row and column. The white square occupies the center of the last row and column.

The pattern of the input grid is preserved in the output grid. However, some of the objects were moved around. For instance, the object that was previously in the second row, third column now appears in the fourth row, fifth column.

### Test_case_object_view

Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number.

There are nine black squares (objects) in the input grid. They occupy an entire row or column. There are no white squares.

There are eight black squares (objects) in the output grid. They occupy an entire row or column. One of them occupies the center of the last row and column.

The pattern of the input grid is preserved in the output grid. However, some of the objects were moved around. For instance, the object that was previously in the second row, third column now appears in the fourth row, fifth column.

### Test_case_transformation

The input grid has five rows and four columns. It contains seven black squares (objects), one gray rectangle, and one white square. The black squares are arranged in a line along the top row, then in a line along the bottom row, then in a line across the middle column, then in a line across the rightmost column.
