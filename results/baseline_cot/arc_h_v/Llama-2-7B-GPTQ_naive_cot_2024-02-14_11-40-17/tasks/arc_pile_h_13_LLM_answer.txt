prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[4, 0, 0, 4], [3, 3, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6]]
output: [[4, 4, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [1, 0, 1, 1]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2]]

Sample Outputs:
output: [[6, 6, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0]]



### Example_1 description

Regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes.

The input grid has five rows and four columns. It consists of six different colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Each row contains two black squares and three white ones. Each column contains two white squares and two black ones.

The output grid also has five rows and four columns. It consists of six different colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). However, it does not contain any black square. Instead, each row contains two white squares and two black ones. Similarly, each column contains two white squares and two black ones.

The pattern changed from a checkerboard to a horizontal stripe pattern.

### Example_2 description

Regarding the second example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.

The input grid has seven rows and eight columns. It consists of nine different colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Each row contains two black squares and three white ones. Each column contains two white squares and two black ones.

The output grid also has seven rows and eight columns. It consists of nine different colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). However, it does not contain any black square. Instead, each row contains two white squares and two black ones. Similarly, each column contains two white squares and two black ones.

The pattern remained unchanged.

### Overall pattern

Describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs.

The overall pattern remains unchanged.

### Instructions

Describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step.

The transformation requires no action.

### Test case input copy

Copy the test case input grid from the task.

```python
[[0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2]]
```

### Test case grid view

Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.

The input grid has five rows and four columns. It consists of six different colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Each row contains two black squares and three white ones. Each column contains two white squares and two black ones.

The output grid also has five rows and four columns. It consists of six different colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). However, it does not contain any black square. Instead, each row contains two white squares and two black ones. Similarly, each column contains two white squares and two black ones.

The pattern changed from a checkerboard to a horizontal stripe pattern.

### Test case object view

Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number.

There are ten objects in total. They consist of nine different colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). There are two black squares, two white squares, and six gray squares.

Each object occupies an area of 2x2 pixels. Their center coordinates are (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), and (9, 0).

Their movements are as follows:
* Object_1 moves upwards once.
* Object_2 moves left twice.
* Object_3 moves right twice.
* Object_4 moves downwards once.
* Object_5 moves left once.
* Object_6 moves right once.
* Object_7 moves downwards once.
* Object_8 moves left once.
* Object_9 moves right once.

Their shapes are as follows:
* Object_1 is a rectangle.
* Object_2 is a rectangle.
* Object_3 is a rectangle.
* Object_4 is a rectangle.
* Object_5 is a rectangle.
* Object_6 is a rectangle.
* Object_7 is a rectangle.
* Object_8 is a rectangle.
* Object_9 is a rectangle.

Their numbers are as follows:
* Object_1 is the first object.
* Object_2 is the third object.
* Object_3 is the fifth object.
* Object_4 is the seventh object.
* Object_5 is the ninth object.
* Object_6 is the eleventh object.
* Object_7 is the thirteenth object.
* Object_8 is the fifteenth object.
* Object_9 is the seventeenth object.

### Test case transformation

Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed.

The transformation requires no action.

### Test case output

Create the resulting output grid as numpy array.

```python
[[3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
