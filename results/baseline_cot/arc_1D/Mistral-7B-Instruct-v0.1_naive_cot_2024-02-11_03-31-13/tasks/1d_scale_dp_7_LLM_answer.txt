prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has three objects (Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3). Object_1 was moved one index to the right, Object_2 was removed, and Object_3 was added at the end of the sequence. Additionally, there were no noise pixels in the input sequence but there were some in the output sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence had two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence also had two objects (Object_1 and Object_2). However, Object_1 was scaled down to size 1 and Object_2 was copied twice to create Object_3 and Object_4. There were no noise pixels in either the input or output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the input sequence can have any number of objects with varying sizes, positions, and colors. The output sequence will always have the same number of objects as the input sequence, but their properties may change according to certain rules. These rules include moving, removing, scaling, copying, recoloring, and aligning objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels in the output sequence that were not present in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Copy the input sequence.
2. Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
3. Determine how the objects should look like in the output sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
4. Apply the necessary transformation rules to achieve the desired output sequence. This may involve moving, removing, scaling, copying, recoloring, and aligning objects.
5. Create the resulting output sequence.
6. Return the output sequence in numpy array format.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, and color. In this case, there is only one object with color 4 and size 4.', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the object should look like in the test output sequence. Since it is the only object, it should remain unchanged.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Since it is the only object, it should remain unchanged.'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format.'}
