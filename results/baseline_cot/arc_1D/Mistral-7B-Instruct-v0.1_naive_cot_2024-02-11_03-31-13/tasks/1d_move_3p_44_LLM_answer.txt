prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has one object (Object_1). The color of Object_1 was changed from 2 to 7, and the position of Object_2 was removed. Therefore, the main change in the input-output pair is the removal of Object_2 and the change of color of Object_1.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has one object (Object_1). The color of Object_1 was changed from 3 to 0, and the position of Object_2 was removed.

However, the color, position, and size of the objects may be modified according to certain rules. Additionally, noise pixels may also be present in the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Iterate through the input sequence and identify the objects.
2. For each object, check if it needs to be moved, hollowed, scaled, removed, copied, or recolored. If it needs to be moved, update its position. If it needs to be hollowed, remove its center pixel. If it needs to be scaled, adjust its size. If it needs to be removed, remove it from the output sequence. If it needs to be copied, create a new object with the same properties. If it needs to be recolored, change its color.
3. Sort the objects in the output sequence based on their color.
4. Add any noise pixels to the output sequence.
5. Return the resulting output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.
