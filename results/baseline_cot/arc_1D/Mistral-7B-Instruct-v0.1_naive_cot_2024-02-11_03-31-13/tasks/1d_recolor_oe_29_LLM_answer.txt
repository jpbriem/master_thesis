prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the information you requested:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has three objects (Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3). Object_1 has been moved one position to the right, Object_2 has been removed, and Object_3 has been added at the end.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence is identical to Example_1 but the output sequence has an additional object (Object_3) with the same properties as Object_1. This suggests that the transformation involves adding an object with the same characteristics as an existing object.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has three objects (Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3). Object_1 has been scaled up to size 8, Object_2 has been removed, and Object_3 has been added at the end. This suggests that the transformation involves scaling an object and removing an object."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern seems to involve moving, removing, scaling, and adding objects to the input sequence. The arithmetic operations count and sort may also play a role in determining the output sequence.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
        1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for adjacent pixels of the same color.
        2. Determine the desired properties of each object (size, position, color) based on the input sequence.
        3. Apply the necessary transformations to achieve the desired properties. These transformations could include move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor, and possibly arithmetic operations like counting and sorting.
        4. Combine the transformed objects into the final output sequence.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!",
        "object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color. In this case, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 7, start_index 0, end_index 5, size 6, and Object_2 with color 0, start_index 6, end_index 7, size 2.",
