The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 4 at positions 4, 5, and 6; and Object_2 with color 0 at position 7. The output sequence has no objects, but it contains the same noise pixels as the input sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 4 at positions 4 through 10.

Otherwise, the output sequence will contain only noise pixels.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence into a variable named `input`.\n2. Iterate over the input sequence and identify the objects. An object is defined as a contiguous sequence of adjacent pixels of the same color. Store the information about each object in a dictionary, where the keys are the object indices (starting from 0) and the values are dictionaries containing the object properties:\n\t* `size`: the number of pixels in the object.\n\t* `position`: the starting index of the object in the input sequence.\n\t* `color`: the color value of the object (from 1 to 9).\n3. Create an empty list named `output`.\n4. Iterate over the input sequence again and process each element:\n\t* If the element is a noise pixel (i.e., not part of any object), add it to the `output` list.\n\t* If the element is part of an object, apply the appropriate transformation(s) based on the object properties stored in the dictionary from step 2. Possible transformations include:\n\t\t+ `move`: shift the object horizontally or vertically by a specified amount.\n\t\t+ `hollow`: remove the interior pixels of the object while keeping the border.\n\t\t+ `scale`: increase or decrease the size of the object proportionally.\n\t\t+ `remove`: remove the object entirely.\n\t\t+ `copy`: create a copy of the object.\n\t\t+ `recolor`: change the color of the object.\n5. Return the `output` list as a NumPy array.\n\nNote that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the programming language and libraries used. However, the overall pattern and logic should remain consistent across different implementations.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence into a variable named `input`.
