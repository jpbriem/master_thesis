prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 2 and size 2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2; and Object_2 with color 7 and size 1, starting at index 7. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been moved one position to the right (starting at index 2), and Object_2 has been removed. Additionally, there is no noise in either the input or output sequence.',
'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 6 and size 6, starting at index 6 and ending at index 12. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been scaled down to size 1 and moved one position to the left (starting at index 5). Additionally, there is no noise in either the input or output sequence.'},
'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to perform various transformations on the objects in the input sequence, including moving, scaling, removing, and recoloring them. There may also be arithmetic operations performed on the objects, such as counting and sorting. The output sequence will have the same number of elements as the input sequence, but the positions and sizes of the objects may have been altered according to the specified transformation rules.',
'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence, focusing on their size, position, and color.
2. Determine the desired transformation(s) to be applied to each object, such as moving, scaling, removing, or recoloring.
3. Apply the transformation(s) to each object in the input sequence.
4. If any arithmetic operations need to be performed on the objects, such as counting or sorting, apply them now.
5. Create the resulting output sequence by combining the transformed objects in the desired order.
6. Return the output sequence in numpy array format.',
'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!',
'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there is one object: Object_1 with color 3 and size 3, starting at index 3 and ending at index 6. There is no noise in the input sequence.',
'transformed_objects': 'Object_1 should be moved one position to the left (starting at index 2), and its color should be recolored to 7. There is no noise in the output sequence.',
'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by moving Object_1 one position to the left and recoloring it to 7. The resulting output sequence should have the same number of elements as the input sequence.'},
