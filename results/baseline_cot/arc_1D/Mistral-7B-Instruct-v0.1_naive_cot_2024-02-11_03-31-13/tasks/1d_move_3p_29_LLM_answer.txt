prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 2 and size 2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2; and Object_2 with color 3 and size 1, starting at index 4 and ending at index 4. The output sequence has no objects, but instead contains four zeros (representing the background color) followed by two copies of object 1 (with color 2 and size 2), then two copies of object 2 (with color 3 and size 1). This indicates that the objects were copied and aligned in the output sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 4 and size 4, starting at index 4 and ending at index 4. The output sequence has one object (with color 4 and size 4) followed by five zeros (representing the background color). This indicates that the object was moved and aligned in the output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the objects in the input sequence are either copied, aligned, or moved in the output sequence. If there are no objects in the input sequence, the output sequence consists of zeros (background color)', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Identify any objects in the input sequence, focusing on their size, position, and color.
2. Determine if the objects need to be copied, aligned, or moved in the output sequence.
3. Create the output sequence by applying the necessary transformations to the identified objects, and filling the remaining positions with zeros (background color).', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

There are no noise pixels.', 'transformed_objects': 'In the test output sequence, Object_1 should have the same color (6) and size (6), but it should be aligned at the beginning of the sequence (starting at index 0).', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by aligning Object_1 at the beginning of the sequence, and filling the remaining positions with zeros (background color).'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format.'}
