            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 3 and size 2, and Object_2 with color 0 and size 1. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been replaced with Object_2 (with color 3 and size 2), and Object_2 has been removed. This change was made because Object_1 overlaps with Object_2 and Object_2 is smaller than Object_1. Additionally, there were no noise pixels in the input sequence, so none were added to the output sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 3 and size 1. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been replaced with itself (with color 3 and size 1), but with a larger size due to the addition of noise pixels. This change was made because Object_1 is too small compared to the rest of the input sequence, and adding noise pixels increases its size while maintaining its original color.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to replace objects with similar objects if they overlap or are too small, and add noise pixels to increase their size.
