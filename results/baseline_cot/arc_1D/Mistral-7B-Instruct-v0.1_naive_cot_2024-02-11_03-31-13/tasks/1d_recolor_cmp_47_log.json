            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here's the information you requested:\n\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has one object (Object_1). The object sizes are the same in both sequences, but their positions differ. Additionally, there are some noise pixels in the input sequence that do not correspond to any object.

If an object is too far away from a noise pixel, it will not be copied over. Additionally, if there are multiple objects close enough to a noise pixel, the closest one will be copied over.

Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence.\n2. Check if the current pixel is a noise pixel (i.e., has a value of 0).\n3. If the current pixel is a noise pixel, find the nearest object that is not too far away. To do this, iterate through each object in the input sequence and calculate the Euclidean distance between the current pixel and the center of each object. Choose the object with the smallest distance.\n4. Once you have identified the nearest object, check if it is too far away from the current pixel. To do this, calculate the Euclidean distance between the center of the object and the current pixel. If this distance is greater than half the size of the object, then the object is too far away and cannot be used to replace the noise pixel. Otherwise, copy the object over to the current pixel.\n5.
