prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]



Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]

Object_1 was removed and replaced with Object_3, which has a different color (3 instead of 2), and its size was increased to cover the entire range of the input sequence. Additionally, Object_2 was moved to the right and its size was decreased.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has one object (Object_3). Object_1 was removed and replaced with Object_3, which has a different color (3 instead of 9), and its size was increased to cover the entire range of the input sequence.

The replacement object has a different color than the original object(s) and its size may be adjusted. Additionally, some of the input objects may be moved or their sizes may be adjusted.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:
        1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for adjacent pixels of the same color.
        2. Determine the desired color, size, and position of the output object(s) based on the input objects.
        3. Replace one or more of the input objects with the output object(s) using the specified color, size, and position.
        4. Optionally, adjust the positions and sizes of the remaining input objects to maintain consistency with the output object(s).",
