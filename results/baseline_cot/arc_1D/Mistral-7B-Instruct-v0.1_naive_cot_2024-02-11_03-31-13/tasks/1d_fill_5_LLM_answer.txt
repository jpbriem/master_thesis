prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 4 at index 5 and Object_2 with color 0 at index 6. The output sequence has the same objects but their positions have been shifted by one unit to the right. This means that Object_1 now starts at index 6 and ends at index 7, while Object_2 still starts at index 7 and ends at index 7. Additionally, the value of Object_1 has been changed to 4, while the value of Object_2 remains unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 6 at index 5. The output sequence has the same object but its position has been shifted by one unit to the left. This means that Object_1 now starts at index 4 and ends at index 5. Additionally, the value of Object_1 has been changed to 6, while the value of Object_2 remains unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to shift the position of each object by one unit to the left or right depending on whether it needs to be moved to the left or right. If an object needs to be moved to the left, its position will be decreased by one unit. If an object needs to be moved to the right, its position will be increased by one unit. The value of each object may also be changed.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Iterate through the input sequence and identify the objects.
2. For each object, determine if it needs to be moved to the left or right.
3. If the object needs to be moved to the left, decrease its position by one unit. If the object needs to be moved to the right, increase its position by one unit.
4. Return the transformed output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Its position is 5 units to the left of the beginning of the sequence.', 'transformed_objects': 'Object_1 should be moved to the left by one unit, so its position will be 4 units to the left of the beginning of the sequence.
