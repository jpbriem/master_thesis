prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the information you requested:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 2 and size 2, and Object_2 with color 3 and size 1. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been removed and replaced with a single object with color 2 and size 2, while Object_2 remains unchanged.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 6 and size 6. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been replaced with a single object with color 0 and size 6.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 3 and size 3. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been replaced with a single object with color 0 and size 3."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern is to remove or replace objects in the input sequence based on their color and size. If an object has the same color as another object but different sizes, it will be replaced with a single object with the larger size. If an object has a different color than any other object, it will be replaced with a single object with color 0.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
        1. Iterate through each element in the input sequence.
        2. If the current element is an object (i.e., has a non-zero value), check if there are any other objects with the same color.
        3. If there are no other objects with the same color, create a new object with color 0 and size equal to the maximum size among all objects in the input sequence.
        4. If there are other objects with the same color, find the object with the largest size among them.
        5. Replace the current object with the object found in step 4.
        6. If the current element is noise (i.e., has a value of 0), leave it unchanged.
        7. Return the resulting output sequence.",
