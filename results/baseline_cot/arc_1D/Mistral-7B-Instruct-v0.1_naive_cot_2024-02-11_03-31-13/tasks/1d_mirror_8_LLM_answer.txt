prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 2 and size 2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2; and Object_2 with color 3 and size 1, starting at index 4 and ending at index 4. The output sequence has no objects, but instead contains noise pixels. Specifically, the first three elements of the output sequence are all 0, while the last element is 9. This suggests that some kind of arithmetic operation was performed on the input sequence, possibly involving counting or sorting. However, it is unclear what specific rule was applied to generate the output sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence is identical to Example_1, except that the order of the objects is reversed. The output sequence also has no objects, but instead contains noise pixels. Again, it is unclear what specific rule was applied to generate the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 3 and size 3, starting at index 0 and ending at index 6. The output sequence has no objects, but instead contains noise pixels. Specifically, the first four elements of the output sequence are all 0, while the last element is 9. This suggests that some kind of arithmetic operation was performed on the input sequence, possibly involving counting or sorting. However, it is unclear what specific rule was applied to generate the output sequence.'},
'overall_pattern': 'In all three examples, the input sequence contains objects and noise pixels, and the output sequence either has no objects or contains noise pixels only. It is unclear what specific rule was applied to generate the output sequence, but it appears to involve some kind of arithmetic operation on the input sequence, possibly involving counting or sorting. Additionally, the objects in the input sequence may have been transformed in some way before being included in the output sequence.',
'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, you will need to follow these steps:
1. Identify any objects in the input sequence, focusing on their size, position, and color.
2. Determine whether any arithmetic operations should be performed on the input sequence, such as counting or sorting. If so, apply these operations to the input sequence.
3. Apply any necessary transformations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, hollowing, scaling, removing, copying, or recoloring.
4. Combine the transformed objects (if any) with the noise pixels (if any) to create the output sequence.
5. Return the resulting output sequence in numpy array format.',
'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there is one object: Object_1 with color 5 and size 5, starting at index 0 and ending at index 5. There are no other objects in the input sequence.', 'transformed_objects': 'There are no objects in the output sequence. Instead, the entire sequence consists of noise pixels.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by setting all elements to 0, except for the last element, which should be set to 9.'},
'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]'}
