prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has one object (Object_1). The object_description field describes the objects in the input sequence as having a size of 2 and being aligned vertically. In contrast, the transformed_objects field describes the object in the output sequence as having a size of 1 and being centered horizontally. This change was achieved through the application of the "move" transformation on Object_1, shifting it to the center of the output sequence.',
'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object (Object_1) while the output sequence has no objects. The object_description field describes the object in the input sequence as having a size of 8 and being aligned vertically. Since there are no objects in the output sequence, the transformed_objects field is empty. This change was achieved through the application of the "remove" transformation on Object_1, removing it entirely from the output sequence.',
'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has one object (Object_1) while the output sequence has no objects. The object_description field describes the object in the input sequence as having a size of 3 and being aligned vertically. Since there are no objects in the output sequence, the transformed_objects field is empty. This change was achieved through the application of the "recolour" transformation on Object_1, changing its color to 0 (background color), effectively removing it from the output sequence.'},
'overall_pattern': 'In all three examples, the input-output relationship involves applying various transformations to the objects in the input sequence, such as "move", "hollow", "scale", "remove", "copy", "recolor". These transformations result in changes to the size, position, and color of the objects in the output sequence. Additionally, noise pixels may also be present in both the input and output sequences.',
'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Apply any necessary arithmetic operations based on the objects in the input sequence, such as counting or sorting.
2. Iterate over each object in the input sequence.
3. For each object, apply the appropriate transformation based on its properties, such as "move", "hollow", "scale", "remove", "copy", or "recolour".
4. If the object has been removed or hollowed out, continue iterating over the remaining objects. Otherwise, add the transformed object to the output sequence.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all objects have been processed.
6. Return the resulting output sequence.',
'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description':'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence.
