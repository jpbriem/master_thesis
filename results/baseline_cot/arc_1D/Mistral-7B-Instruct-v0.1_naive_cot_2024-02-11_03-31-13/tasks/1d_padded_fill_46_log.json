            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence.

The output sequence contains only one object, which spans the entire length of the input sequence and has a value of 8. This means that every element in the input sequence corresponds to an element in the output sequence, but the values may differ. In particular, the first element in the input sequence (which is 0) becomes the first element in the output sequence (which is also 0), while the second element in the input sequence (which is 8) becomes the last element in the output sequence (which is also 8). All other elements in the input sequence become 0 in the output sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has two objects: one starting at index 2 and ending at index 5, and another starting at index 7 and ending at index 10. The output sequence has two objects as well: one starting at index 2 and ending at index 6, and another starting at index 7 and ending at index 11. Both objects in the output sequence have the same value (which is 2 in this case), but they span different parts of the input sequence. Specifically, the first object in the input sequence (which starts at index 0 and ends at index 1) becomes the first object in the output sequence (which starts at index 2 and ends at index 6), while the second object in the input sequence (which starts at index 2 and ends at index 5) becomes the second object in the output sequence (which starts at index 7 and ends at index 11).

However, the specific details of the transformation depend on the input sequence and may vary across different examples. In general, the transformation seems to involve some kind of rearrangement or manipulation of the objects in the input sequence, as well as some kind of scaling or resizing of those objects.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for consecutive elements with the same color value.\n2. Determine the positions and sizes of each object by finding the start and end indices of each object in the input sequence.\n3. Move each object to a new position in the output sequence, depending on the desired outcome. This may involve shifting the object to the left or right, duplicating it, or removing it entirely.\n4. Resize each object to the desired size, if necessary. This may involve increasing or decreasing the number of elements in the object, or adjusting the size of individual elements within the object.\n5.
