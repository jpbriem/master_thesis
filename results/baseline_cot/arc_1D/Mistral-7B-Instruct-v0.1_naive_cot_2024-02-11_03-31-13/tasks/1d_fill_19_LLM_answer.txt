prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 3 and size 2, and Object_2 with color 0 and size 1. In the output sequence, both objects are copied and their positions remain the same. However, the color of Object_1 is changed to 3, while the color of Object_2 remains unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 5 and size 1. In the output sequence, the object is copied and its position remains the same. However, the color of the object is changed to 5, and it is repeated four times to create a total of five occurrences of this object.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to copy objects from the input sequence and change their colors if necessary. The position of the objects remains the same. If there are no objects in the input sequence, the output sequence will be an empty sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Copy all objects from the input sequence to the output sequence.
2. Check each object in the output sequence.
3. If the object has a color other than 0 (background color), change its color to match the color of the corresponding object in the input sequence.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all objects in the output sequence have been checked.
5. Return the final output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
