prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the information you requested:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has three objects (Object_1', Object_2', and Object_3'). Object_1 and Object_2 are merged into one object (Object_1') and Object_2 is replaced with Object_3'. Additionally, the noise pixel at index 5 is removed.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has three objects (Object_1', Object_2', and Object_3'). Object_1 and Object_2 are merged into one object (Object_1') and Object_2 is replaced with Object_3'. Additionally, the noise pixel at index 6 is removed.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has three objects (Object_1', Object_2', and Object_3'). Object_1 and Object_2 are merged into one object (Object_1') and Object_2 is replaced with Object_3'. Additionally, the noise pixel at index 7 is removed."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern is to merge adjacent objects of the same color and replace them with a single object if they have the same color. If there are multiple objects of the same color, the first one encountered will be kept and the rest will be removed. Any noise pixels will also be removed.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
        1. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence.
        2. If the current pixel is a noise pixel, skip it.
        3. If the current pixel is an object, check if it overlaps with any other object in the input sequence.
        4. If the current pixel does not overlap with any other object, create a new object with the same color and add it to the output sequence.
        5. If the current pixel overlaps with another object, merge the two objects into one object and add it to the output sequence.
        6. Repeat steps 2-5 until all pixels have been processed.",
