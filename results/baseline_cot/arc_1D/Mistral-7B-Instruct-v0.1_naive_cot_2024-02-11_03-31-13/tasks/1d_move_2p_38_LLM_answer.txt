prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 4 at positions 4, 5, and 6; and Object_2 with color 0 at position 7. The output sequence has no objects, but it contains the same noise pixels as the input sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 4 at positions 4 through 10. The output sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 4 at positions 4 through 10, and an additional object: Object_2 with color 0 at position 11.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input sequence, the output sequence consists of either no objects (if there are no adjacent pixels of the same color) or one or more objects with the same color as the corresponding adjacent pixels in the input sequence. The objects may be moved, scaled, or removed, and their sizes and positions may change. There may also be arithmetic operations performed on the objects, such as counting or sorting. The overall pattern appears to involve simple manipulations of the input sequence based on the presence and properties of adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:
1. Iterate over the input sequence and identify any adjacent pixels of the same color. If there are none, return the input sequence as the output sequence. Otherwise, create an empty list called "objects" to store the objects found.
2. For each pair of adjacent pixels of the same color, check if they form an object by comparing their positions and sizes. If they do, add them to the "objects" list with their color, start index, end index, and size.
3. Sort the "objects" list in ascending order of their start indices.
4. Create a new output sequence with the same length as the input sequence. Initialize it to all zeros.
5. Iterate over the sorted "objects" list and perform the appropriate operation(s) on each object to generate the corresponding output sequence element(s). This may involve moving, scaling, removing, or recoloring the object, or performing arithmetic operations on it.
6. Return the resulting output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.
