prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects (Object_1 and Object_2) while the output sequence has one object (Object_1). The color of Object_1 was changed from 2 to 0, and the color of Object_2 was removed. Additionally, there were no noise pixels in the input sequence, but there were three noise pixels added to the output sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence had one object (Object_1), while the output sequence had no objects. The color of Object_1 was changed from 8 to 0, and three noise pixels were added to the output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the input sequence may have multiple objects, and the output sequence may have fewer or more objects than the input sequence. The color of each object can be changed, and noise pixels can be added or removed. The order of the objects in the input sequence does not affect their positions in the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for adjacent pixels of the same color.
2. Determine the desired changes to the objects, such as changing their color, removing them, adding noise pixels, etc.
3. Apply the desired changes to the objects.
4. Create the resulting output sequence by combining the transformed objects and any necessary noise pixels.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Its color is 3.', 'transformed_objects': 'The object should have a size of 1 and a position of 4. Its color should be changed from 3 to 0.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by removing Object_1 and adding three noise pixels at positions 0, 2, and 6.'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}
