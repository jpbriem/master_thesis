prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 4 at positions 4, 5, and 6; and Object_2 with color 0 at position 7. The output sequence has no objects, indicating that the input objects were removed. This was done because the objects did not meet any specified criteria (e.g., they were too small or too far apart).', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 4 at positions 4 through 10. The output sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 4 at positions 4 through 10, but with a larger size (indicated by the value 8 instead of 4). This was done because the input object met the specified criteria (e.g., it was large enough and close enough to other objects).', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 3 at position 0. The output sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 3 at position 0, but with a smaller size (indicated by the value 0 instead of 3). This was done because the input object did not meet the specified criteria (e.g., it was too small).'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to remove or modify objects based on their size, position, color, and other specified criteria. If an object does not meet these criteria, it will be removed from the output sequence. If an object meets the criteria, it will be modified according to the specific action (e.g., moved, scaled, etc.).', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
2. Check if each object meets the specified criteria. If it does not, remove it from the output sequence. If it does, proceed to step 3.
3. Modify the object according to the specific action (e.g., move, scale, etc.) based on the specified criteria.
4. Return the resulting output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
