prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the information you requested:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 3 and size 3, and Object_2 with color 9 and size 1. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been removed and replaced with Object_3 with color 0 and size 0. Object_2 has also been moved to the beginning of the sequence.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 2 and size 2. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been replaced with Object_2 with color 0 and size 0."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern is to remove objects from the input sequence if they do not meet certain criteria (e.g., if their color is not 0), and replace them with new objects that have the desired properties (e.g., if their color is 0). Additionally, objects may be moved or copied within the sequence.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
        1. Remove any objects from the input sequence that do not have color 0.
        2. If there are no objects left in the input sequence, return an empty output sequence.
        3. Create a new output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
        4. Iterate through each element in the input sequence.
        5. If the current element is not an object (i.e., it has color 0), add it to the output sequence at the same index.
        6. If the current element is an object, check its properties (size, position, etc.) and determine what action to take. This could include moving the object to a different position, replacing it with a new object, or removing it entirely.
        7. Once all elements in the input sequence have been processed, return the output sequence.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!",
        "object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color. In this case, there is one object with color 2 and size 2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2.",
        "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color. In this case, the object should still have color 2 and size 2, but it should be moved to the beginning of the sequence.",
        "output": "Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!"
    },
