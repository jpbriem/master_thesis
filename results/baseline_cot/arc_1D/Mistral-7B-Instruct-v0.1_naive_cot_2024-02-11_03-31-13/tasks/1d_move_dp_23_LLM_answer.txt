prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 3 and size 3, and Object_2 with color 2 and size 1. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been removed and replaced with a single object with color 3 and size 6 (the sum of the original Object_1 and Object_2 sizes). Object_2 has also been removed. Additionally, there is an extra noise pixel at index 5.',
'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence is identical to Example_1 but with the positions of the objects reversed. In the output sequence, the objects have been moved to their original positions in the input sequence.'},
'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to remove objects from the input sequence if they overlap with other objects, and replace them with larger objects that cover the entire area of the removed object. If there are no overlapping objects, then the removed object is simply replaced with a larger version of itself. Any noise pixels remain unchanged.',
'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Iterate through each object in the input sequence.
2. Check if the current object overlaps with any other objects in the input sequence. If it does, remove it. Otherwise, keep it.
3. Replace any removed objects with larger versions of themselves that cover the entire area of the removed object.
4. Return the resulting output sequence.',
'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description':'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'},
'test_output': '[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2]'}
