prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 7 and size 6, and Object_2 with color 6 and size 6. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been moved one position to the left, while Object_2 has been removed entirely. Additionally, there are no noise pixels in either the input or output sequence.',
'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has three objects: Object_1 with color 0 and size 0, Object_2 with color 8 and size 1, and Object_3 with color 1 and size 1. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been removed entirely, while Object_2 has been shifted one position to the right and Object_3 has been shifted two positions to the right. There are also no noise pixels in either the input or output sequence.'},
'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to manipulate the objects in the input sequence based on their color, size, and position relative to other objects. Noise pixels are ignored. The specific operations performed on the objects depend on the input sequence and may include moving, removing, scaling, copying, and recoloring. The output sequence reflects these changes made to the objects in the input sequence.',
'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Copy the input sequence.
2. Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
3. Determine how the objects should look in the output sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
4. Perform the necessary operations on the objects to create the output sequence. These operations may include moving, removing, scaling, copying, and recoloring.
5. Return the resulting output sequence in numpy array format.',
'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!',
'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 4 and size 5, and Object_2 with color 5 and size 5. Object_1 starts at index 1 and ends at index 2, while Object_2 starts at index 3 and ends at index 4. Both objects have the same color.',
'transformed_objects': 'In the test output sequence, Object_1 will remain unchanged, while Object_2 will be shifted one position to the left. This means that Object_2 will now start at index 2 and end at index 3. The color of both objects will remain the same (4 and 5).'},
'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by shifting Object_2 one position to the left. The resulting output sequence should be [0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Return this sequence in numpy array format.'}
