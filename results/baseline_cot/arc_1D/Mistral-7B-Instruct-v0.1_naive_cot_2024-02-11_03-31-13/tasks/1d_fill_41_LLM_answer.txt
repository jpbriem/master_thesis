prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the information you requested:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 2 and size 2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2; and Object_2 with color 3 and size 1, starting at index 4 and ending at index 4. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been moved one position to the right (starting at index 2), and Object_2 has been copied and placed after Object_1. Additionally, there are some noise pixels added to the output sequence.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 3 and size 1, starting at index 3 and ending at index 3. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been moved three positions to the left (starting at index 0) and its size has been increased to 3. Additionally, there are some noise pixels added to the output sequence.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 8 and size 1, starting at index 7 and ending at index 7. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been moved one position to the left (starting at index 6) and its size has been increased to 8. Additionally, there are some noise pixels added to the output sequence."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern for this task is to transform the input sequence by applying various operations to the objects and adding noise pixels. The operations include moving, copying, scaling, removing, and recoloring objects. The relationships between objects can also affect their transformations, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment. The arithmetic operations count and sort can also be applied to the objects.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
        1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
        2. Describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, and color.
        3. Apply the necessary operations to the objects to create the desired output sequence.
        4. Create the resulting test output sequence.
