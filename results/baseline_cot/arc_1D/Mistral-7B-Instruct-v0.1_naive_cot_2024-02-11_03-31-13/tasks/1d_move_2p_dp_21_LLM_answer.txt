prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 7 and size 7, and Object_2 with color 0 and size 0. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been moved one position to the left, and Object_2 has been removed. Additionally, there is an extra noise pixel at index 8.',
'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 5 and size 5. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been scaled down to size 0, and there is an extra noise pixel at index 9.'},
'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to manipulate the objects in the input sequence based on their color, size, position, and alignment with other objects. Noise pixels may also be added or removed. The output sequence will have the same number of elements as the input sequence, but the values may be different.',
'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and size.
2. Determine the desired manipulations for each object (e.g., move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor).
3. Apply the manipulations to the objects while considering their positions and alignments with other objects.
4. Add or remove noise pixels as necessary.
5. Create the resulting output sequence with the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with the modified values.',
'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!',
'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there is one object: Object_1 with color 1 and size 1, starting at index 0 and ending at index 1. There are no noise pixels.',
'transformed_objects': 'Object_1 should remain unchanged in the output sequence.',
'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence with the value 1 at index 0 and 0 at all other indices.'},
'test_output': '[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}
