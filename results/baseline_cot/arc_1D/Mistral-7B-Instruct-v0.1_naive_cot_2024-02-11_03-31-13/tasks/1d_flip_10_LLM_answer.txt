prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 2, start_index 1, end_index 2, size 2; and Object_2 with color 3, start_index 4, end_index 4, size 1. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been moved one index to the left (start_index = 0), while Object_2 has been removed entirely. Additionally, noise pixel 6 has been replaced with noise pixel 2.',
'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has three objects: Object_1 with color 5, start_index 0, end_index 0, size 1; Object_2 with color 8, start_index 1, end_index 4, size 4; and Object_3 with color 8, start_index 5, end_index 5, size 1. In the output sequence, Object_1 has been moved one index to the right (end_index = 1), while Object_2 has been copied and placed at the beginning of the sequence. Additionally, noise pixel 0 has been replaced with noise pixel 5.'},
'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to manipulate the positions and sizes of objects in the input sequence, as well as replace noise pixels with other values. The specific operations performed depend on the input sequence and may involve moving, removing, scaling, copying, recoloring, counting, sorting, and arithmetic operations based on objects.',
'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Copy the input sequence.
2. Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
3. Determine how the objects should look in the output sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
4. Perform the necessary operations to achieve the desired output sequence. This may involve moving, removing, scaling, copying, recoloring, counting, sorting, and arithmetic operations based on objects.
5. Create the resulting output sequence.
6. Return the output sequence in numpy array format.',

'transformed_objects': 'Object_1 should be moved one index to the left (start_index = 0) and scaled down to size 1. Object_2 should be moved one index to the right (end_index = 2) and scaled up to size 3. Additionally, noise pixel 7 should be replaced with noise pixel 0.',
