prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 6 at positions 5 and 7, and Object_2 with color 0 at position 10. The output sequence has no objects, but it has the same noise pixels as the input sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1 with color 2 at positions 2 and 4. The output sequence has the same noise pixels as the input sequence, but it has an additional object: Object_2 with color 0 at position 6.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input sequence, the output sequence has the same noise pixels as the input sequence, but it may have additional objects or modified existing objects. The objects can have different sizes, positions, and colors. The objects can also have different types of transformations applied to them, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor. The objects can also have different relationships with each other, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment. The objects can be removed entirely from the output sequence if they do not meet certain conditions. The arithmetic operations performed on the objects can include counting and sorting. The overall pattern seems to involve applying various transformations to the objects based on their properties and relationships with each other, while preserving some aspects of the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:
1. Copy the test case input sequence into a variable called `input`.
2. Describe the objects in the input sequence using the `object_description` function. This function should focus on the size, position, and color of each object.
3. Apply any necessary transformations to the objects using the `transformed_objects` function. This function should focus on the size, position, and color of each object after the transformation.
4. Create the resulting test output sequence using the `output` function. This function should create a new numpy array with the same length as the input sequence, and populate it with the transformed objects and noise pixels.
5. Return the created test output sequence using the `test_output` function. This function should return the resulting numpy array.', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.
