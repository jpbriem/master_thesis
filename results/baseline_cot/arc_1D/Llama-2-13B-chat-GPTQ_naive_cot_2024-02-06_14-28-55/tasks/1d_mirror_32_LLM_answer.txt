You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, I can see that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations. Here's my understanding of the task:

* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 9, representing different pixel colors.
* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example, [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with two objects: Object_1 (color 2) and Object_2 (color 3).
* The output sequence is obtained by applying a set of transformations to the input sequence, including move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
* The transformations are conditioned on the objects in the input sequence, such as their size, position, and color.
* The goal is to transform the given input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using the specified transformations.

Based on the examples provided, here's the pattern I observe:

* Objects in the input sequence are transformed according to the following rules:
	+ Move: Objects move to a new location based on their current position and size.
	+ Hollow: Objects shrink to half their original size.
	+ Scale: Objects change size based on a scaling factor.
	+ Remove: Objects are removed if they have a size of 0.
	+ Copy: Objects are copied to a new location.
	+ Recolor: Objects change color based on a new value.
* The transformations are applied in a specific order, determined by the position of the objects in the input sequence.

Now, let me apply these transformations to the given input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

First, I will apply the moves:

Object_1 (color 2): move from position 1 to position 3.
Object_2 (color 3): move from position 4 to position 6.

Next, I will apply the hollows:

Object_1 (color 2): shrink to half size (from 2 to 1).
Object_2 (color 3): shrink to half size (from 3 to 1).

Then, I will apply the scales:

Object_1 (color 2): scale by 2 (from 1 to 2).
Object_2 (color 3): scale by 3 (from 1 to 3).

After that, I will apply the removes:

Object_1 (color 2): remove since it has a size of 0.
Object_2 (color 3): remove since it has a size of 0.

Finally, I will apply the copies and recolors:

Object_1 (color 2): copy to position 2 and recolor to 9.
Object_2 (color 3): copy to position 7 and recolor to 9.

And there we have it! The transformed output sequence is:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
