[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.

To begin, let me describe the input and output sequences for Example_1:

Input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
Output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

In this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of objects (represented by consecutive identical values) with some noise pixels (represented by the value 0). The output sequence has undergone several transformations, including:

* Moving objects: Some objects have been moved to different positions in the output sequence. For example, the first object (value 8) has been moved two positions to the right.
* Resizing objects: Some objects have been resized, either by expanding or contracting their size. For example, the second object (value 8) has been expanded to cover three positions in the output sequence.
* Removing objects: One object (value 0) has been removed entirely from the output sequence.
* Changing object properties: Some objects have had their properties modified, such as changing the color of an object (value 8) to value 5.

Now, let me describe the overall pattern that relates the input and output sequences for all three examples:

Overall Pattern: The input sequence is transformed through a series of operations that involve object movements, resizings, removals, and changes to object properties. These operations create a new output sequence where objects may have different sizes, positions, and colors than in the original input sequence. Noise pixels may also be introduced or removed.

Next, I will provide the instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its output sequence, based on the above pattern:

Instructions: To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence by looking for consecutive identical values.
2. Apply the following transformations to each object:
a. Move objects to different positions in the output sequence, depending on the specific pattern for each example.
b. Resize objects by expanding or contracting their size, depending on the specific pattern for each example.
c. Remove objects entirely from the output sequence, if applicable.
d. Change object properties, such as color, depending on the specific pattern for each example.
e. Introduce noise pixels, if applicable.
3. Output the resulting output sequence.

Finally, here is the transformation for the given test input sequence:

Transformation:

Input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence.

Object_1: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] (size: 8, position: 1-8)
Object_2: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] (size: 8, position: 9-16)
Object_3: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0] (size: 8, position: 17-24)

Step 2: Apply transformations.

For Object_1: Move 1 position to the right (position: 1-8).
For Object_2: Move 2 positions to the left (position: 9-11), then resize to size 5.
For Object_3: Move 2 positions to the left (position: 17-19), then resize to size 5.

Noise pixels added: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 8, position: 25-32)

Output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Therefore, the test output sequence is: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8].
