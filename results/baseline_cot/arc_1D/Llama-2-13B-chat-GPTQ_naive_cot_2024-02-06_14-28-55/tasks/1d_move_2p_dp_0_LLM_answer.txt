You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The output sequence is obtained by applying some kind of transformation to the input sequence.

From the examples given, we can observe the following patterns:

* Objects in the input sequence are transformed according to certain rules, such as moving, resizing, or changing color.
* Pixels with value 0 represent the background color, while pixels with value 1 represent the foreground color.
* The transformation preserves the overall structure of the input sequence, but may change the details of individual objects.

To solve this task, we need to identify the specific transformation that applies to each input sequence. Let's analyze each example in turn:

Example 1:
Input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of a series of identical objects (represented by the value 2) separated by gaps (represented by the value 0). The output sequence is obtained by copying the input sequence, but with each object moved one position to the right and the gap between them reduced by half.

Example 2:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of a series of identical objects (represented by the value 7) separated by gaps (represented by the value 0). The output sequence is obtained by replacing each object with the number of gaps that precede it.

Example 3:
Input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of a series of identical objects (represented by the value 8) separated by gaps (represented by the value 0). The output sequence is obtained by replacing each object with the number of gaps that follow it.

Now let's apply these patterns to the test case:

Test Case:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, we can deduce the following transformation:

* Objects in the input sequence are moved one position to the right.
* Gaps between objects are reduced by half.

Applying these rules to the test case, we get:

Transformed Output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As expected, the transformed output is identical to the original input sequence. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Transformation: None

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
