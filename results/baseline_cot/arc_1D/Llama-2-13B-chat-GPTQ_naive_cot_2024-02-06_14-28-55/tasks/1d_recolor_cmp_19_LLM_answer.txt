You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the input-output pairs:

* Example_1: In this example, the input sequence has two objects of color 7, one object of color 0, and one object of color 7. The output sequence has four objects of color 4, each with a size of 2x2 pixels, and one object of color 0. This suggests that the transformation involves grouping adjacent pixels of the same color together to form larger objects, and changing the color of some pixels to 4.
* Example_2: In this example, the input sequence has three objects of color 7, one object of color 0, and one object of color 7. The output sequence has four objects of color 4, each with a size of 2x2 pixels, and one object of color 0. Similar to Example_1, the transformation appears to group adjacent pixels of the same color together to form larger objects, and change the color of some pixels to 4.
* Example_3: In this example, the input sequence has five objects of color 7, one object of color 0, and one object of color 7. The output sequence has seven objects of color 4, each with a size of 2x2 pixels, and one object of color 0. This example shows that the transformation can create new objects by combining smaller objects, and can also change the color of some pixels to 4.

Based on these patterns, it seems that the transformation involves grouping adjacent pixels of the same color together to form larger objects, and changing the color of some pixels to 4. Additionally, the transformation may involve creating new objects by combining smaller objects.

Now, let me describe the transformation in more detail:

* Objects: The transformation involves moving, resizing, and recoloring objects. Objects can be moved horizontally, vertically, or both, and their sizes can be increased or decreased. Some objects may be removed or replaced with new ones.
* Noise pixels: The transformation may introduce noise pixels, which are pixels that do not belong to any object. These pixels may be randomly distributed throughout the image.
* Arithmetic operations: The transformation may involve arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, and summing the objects. These operations may affect the size, position, and color of the objects.
* Conditional logic: The transformation may involve conditional statements that determine the outcome of the transformation based on specific conditions. For example, an object may be moved or resized only if it meets certain criteria.

With this understanding of the transformation, let me describe how I would transform the test input sequence:

* Input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]
* Output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]

In this example, I have applied the transformation rules described above to produce the output sequence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation:

1. Object_1 (color 7): Move to (1, 1) and resize to 2x2 pixels.
2. Object_2 (color 7): Move to (3, 1) and resize to 2x2 pixels.
3. Object_3 (color 7): Move to (5, 1) and resize to 2x2 pixels.
4. Object_4 (color 0): Remove.
5. Object_5 (color 7): Move to (7, 1) and resize to 2x2 pixels.
6. Noise pixel at (2, 2): Add a noise pixel with color 4.
7. Noise pixel at (4, 4): Add a noise pixel with color 4.
8. Arithmetic operation: Sum the sizes of Objects_1, _2, and _3, and add 2 to the result. Set the size of Object_5 to the result.
9. Conditional logic: If the size of Object_5 is greater than 4, move it to (9, 1) and resize it to 2x2 pixels. Otherwise, leave it unchanged.
10. Output: Create the resulting output sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
