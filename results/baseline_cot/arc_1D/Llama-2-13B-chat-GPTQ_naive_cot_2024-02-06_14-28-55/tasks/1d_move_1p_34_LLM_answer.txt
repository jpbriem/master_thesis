[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects (or pixels) around, resizing them, and changing their color. The noise pixels also seem to play a role in the transformation.

For the given input sequence `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I observe:

* There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color `8` and one object of color `0`.
* The two objects of color `8` are located at positions `1-3` and `5-7`, respectively. They are both of size `2`.
* The object of color `0` is located at position `4` and has size `1`.
* All objects are aligned horizontally and there is no overlap between them.

Now, let me describe the transformation that would produce the corresponding output sequence:

* Move the two objects of color `8` so that they are adjacent to each other, with one object being shifted left by one position. This results in the objects being located at positions `1-2` and `3-4`, respectively.
* Resize the two objects of color `8` so that they are both of size `3`.
* Change the color of the object of color `0` to `8`.
* Add noise pixels to the output sequence to make it more diverse.

Here's the resulting output sequence: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

As for the overall pattern, it appears that the transformation involves moving and resizing objects, as well as changing their color. The noise pixels also play a role in adding diversity to the output sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
