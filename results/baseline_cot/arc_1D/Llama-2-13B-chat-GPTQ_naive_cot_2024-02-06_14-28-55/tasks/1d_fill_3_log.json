The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nFrom the examples, we can see that the transformations involve moving objects (represented by non-zero values) around, resizing them, and changing their color. Additionally, there may be noise pixels added to the output sequence.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand the rules governing these transformations and apply them to the given input sequence. Here's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* The input sequence consists of 18 integers representing pixel colors.\n* There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n* The pixels are arranged in a 3x6 grid, with each pixel having a value of either 0 (background color) or 3 (foreground color).\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* The output sequence consists of 18 integers representing pixel colors.\n* There are noise pixels in the output sequence, represented by values other than 0 or 3.\n* The pixels are still arranged in a 3x6 grid, but they have undergone various transformations, including movement, resizing, and color changes.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here are the observed patterns and rules governing the transformations:\n\n1. Objects can move horizontally or vertically by up to two pixels. This means that an object can move left, right, up, or down by one or two pixels.\n2. Objects can change size by up to two pixels in either direction (left, right, up, or down). This means that an object can grow or shrink by one or two pixels in any direction.\n3. Objects can change color. This means that an object can change from a foreground color (value 3) to a background color (value 0), or vice versa.\n4. Noise pixels can be added to the output sequence. These are represented by values other than 0 or 3.\n\nWith these rules in mind, let's analyze the given input sequence:\n\nInput Sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere's how I would transform this input sequence into the corresponding output sequence based on the observed patterns and rules:\n\nOutput Sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The first pixel (value 0) remains unchanged.\n2. The second pixel (value 0) moves one pixel to the right and changes size to two pixels wide.\n3. The third pixel (value 3) moves one pixel down and changes size to three pixels tall.\n4. The fourth pixel (value 0) moves one pixel up and changes size to two pixels tall.\n5. The fifth pixel (value 0) stays put and retains its original size.\n6. The sixth pixel (value 3) moves one pixel to the left and changes size to three pixels wide.\n7. The seventh pixel (value 0) moves one pixel down and changes size to two pixels tall.\n8. The eighth pixel (value 0) stays put and retains its original size.\n9. The ninth pixel (value 3) moves one pixel up and changes size to three pixels tall.\n10. The tenth pixel (value 0) moves one pixel to the left and changes size to two pixels wide.\n11. The eleventh pixel (value 0) stays put and retains its original size.\n12. The twelfth pixel (value 3) moves one pixel to the right and changes size to three pixels wide.\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has undergone several transformations based on the observed patterns and rules, including movement, resizing, and color changes.\n\nNow, to answer the questions posed in the task description:\n\n1. What changed?\n\nIn the input sequence, there were only zeros and threes. In the output sequence, there are now zeros, threes, and other random values (noise pixels).\n\n2. How did it change?\n\nThe objects in the input sequence moved, resized, and changed color in the output sequence.\n\n3. What is the overall pattern?\n\nThe overall pattern is that objects can move, resize, and change color, and noise pixels can be added to the output sequence.\n\n4. Instructions:\n\nTo transform a new input sequence, follow the same rules as above: move objects, resize them, and change their color. Add noise pixels as necessary.\n\n5. Transformation:\n\nThe transformation function takes an input sequence and applies the observed patterns and rules to produce an output sequence. The function returns the resulting output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the task is to write a Python function that takes an input sequence as a list of integers and applies the observed patterns and rules to produce an output sequence. The function should return the resulting output sequence as a list of integers."
