            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, changing their size and color, and removing or adding objects. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we see two objects (colors 2 and 4) that are moved horizontally by one position. Object 2 is resized to twice its original size, while object 4 is removed. Finally, the background color is set to 0.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have three objects (colors 6, 8, and 8) that are resized and moved. Objects 6 and 8 are doubled in size, while object 8 is moved left by four positions. Additionally, the background color is set to 8.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, there is only one object (color 7), which is resized to seven times its original size and moved right by seven positions.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer that the desired transformation is a function that takes an input sequence of pixels and applies the following operations:\n\n* Moves objects horizontally by one or more positions\n* Resizes objects by a factor of 2 or more\n* Removes objects\n* Sets the background color to 0 or 8\n\nTo perform this transformation, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate operations to each object. We can represent the objects in the input sequence as dictionaries, where each key corresponds to a pixel color and the value indicates the size and position of the object.\n\nFor example, here's how we could represent the objects in the input sequence for Example 1:\n```\nobjects = [\n    {\"color\": 2, \"size\": 2, \"position\": [1, 2]},\n    {\"color\": 4, \"size\": 1, \"position\": [4, 5]}\n]\n```\nWith this representation, we can now describe the transformation for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nTransform the input sequence by moving objects according to their positions and sizes:\n\n* Move object 2 (color 2) right by 2 positions\n* Move object 4 (color 4) left by 1 position\n* Set the background color to 0\n\nExample 2:\nTransform the input sequence by resizing and moving objects:\n\n* Double the size of object 6 (color 6)\n* Move object 8 (color 8) left by 4 positions\n* Set the background color to 8\n\nExample 3:\nTransform the input sequence by resizing and moving objects:\n\n* Set the background color to 8\n* Resize object 7 (color 7) to 7 times its original size and move it right by 7 positions\n\nOverall, the transformation pattern appears to involve applying a series of operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, resizing them, and setting the background color. To complete the task, we need to write a Python function that takes an input sequence and applies these operations accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to provide the Python code for the transformation function."
