The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some logical rules and patterns.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and ones, representing different colors. The output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with some changes in the values. Specifically, any element that has a value of 2 in the input sequence has been replaced with a value of 0 in the output sequence. Additionally, the last element of the output sequence has a value of 4, which was not present in the input sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence again consists of a series of zeros and ones, representing different colors. However, this time there are some additional values present in the input sequence that were not present in the previous examples (specifically, the values 8 and 4). The output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with some changes in the values. Specifically, any element that has a value of 4 in the input sequence has been replaced with a value of 0 in the output sequence. Additionally, the last element of the output sequence has a value of 8, which was not present in the input sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence is similar to the previous examples, but with one key difference: the last element of the input sequence has a value of 8, which is not present in the other examples. The output sequence also has the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with some changes in the values. Specifically, any element that has a value of 9 in the input sequence has been replaced with a value of 8 in the output sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves replacing certain values in the input sequence with others, and possibly adding or removing elements from the sequence. Specifically, it looks like any element that has a value of 2 or 4 in the input sequence will be replaced with a value of 0 in the output sequence, while any element that has a value of 9 in the input sequence will be replaced with a value of 8 in the output sequence. Additionally, it appears that the last element of the output sequence will always have a value of 8, regardless of the value of the last element in the input sequence.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, thinking step by step:\n\nStep 1: Check if any elements in the input sequence have a value of 2 or 4. If so, replace those elements with a value of 0.\n\nStep 2: Check if any elements in the input sequence have a value of 9. If so, replace those elements with a value of 8.\n\nStep 3: Add a value of 8 to the last element of the output sequence.\n\nWith these steps, we can transform any valid input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFinally, here is the test output sequence for the given input:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
