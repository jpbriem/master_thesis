            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there are some noise pixels that need to be taken into account.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are five objects in the input sequence, each with a size of 5. They are located at positions 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20.\n* Noise pixels: There are three noise pixels at positions 5, 10, and 15.\n* Transformations: To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following transformations:\n\t+ Move object at position 0 to position 3 (since the background color is 0).\n\t+ Scale object at position 5 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n\t+ Scale object at position 10 by a factor of 3 in both x and y directions.\n\t+ Remove object at position 15.\n\t+ Copy object at position 20 and move it to position 15.\n\t+ Change the color of object at position 5 from 5 to 3.\n\nBased on these transformations, the expected output sequence would be:\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n```\nHere's the detailed explanation of each transformation:\n\n1. Move object at position 0 to position 3: Since the background color is 0, we can simply move the object at position 0 to position 3 without any changes.\n2. Scale object at position 5 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions: This will double the size of the object in both x and y directions.\n3. Scale object at position 10 by a factor of 3 in both x and y directions: This will triple the size of the object in both x and y directions.\n4. Remove object at position 15: Since this object is already removed, there is no need to apply any transformations.\n5. Copy object at position 20 and move it to position 15: We copy the object at position 20 and move it to position 15 to replace the removed object.\n6. Change the color of object at position 5 from 5 to 3: Since the object at position 5 has a color of 5, we change it to 3.\n\nTherefore, the final output sequence is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`."
