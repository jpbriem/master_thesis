[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence of zeros and twos. The output sequence consists of only zeros, with the exception of one two at the beginning. From this, we can deduce that any object (i.e., a sequence of consecutive pixels of the same color) that contains at least one pixel of color two will be replaced by a single zero. This suggests that the transformation rule is to replace any object containing a pixel of color two with a single zero.

Example 2:
Here, we have an input sequence consisting entirely of sixes. The output sequence is similar, but with all the sixes replaced by zeros. This indicates that any object containing only pixels of color six will be replaced by a single zero.

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence consisting solely of zeros and one non-zero pixel (a three). The output sequence consists of only zeros, indicating that any object containing a pixel of color three will be replaced by a single zero.

Based on these examples, we can infer that the general transformation pattern is as follows:

* Any object containing a pixel of color two will be replaced by a single zero.
* Any object containing only pixels of color six will be replaced by a single zero.
* Any object containing a pixel of color three will be replaced by a single zero.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the given test case:

input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Using the above pattern, we can identify the objects in the input sequence as follows:

Object 1: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] (containing pixels of color three)
Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (containing no pixels of color two, six, or three)

To transform the input sequence, we need to replace any objects containing pixels of color two, six, or three with single zeros. Therefore, the output sequence will be:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
