[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and copying them. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:

Example 1:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of five objects of color 0 (background color), and two objects of color 5. The output sequence has the same objects, but they have been moved horizontally by one position to the right. This means that each object has been shifted by one position to the right, so the total length of the output sequence is still 9.

Example 2:
Input: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of three objects of color 3, and the output sequence has the same objects, but they have been replicated three times. This means that each object has been copied three times, so the total length of the output sequence is now 9.

Example 3:
Input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of six objects of color 6, and the output sequence has the same objects, but they have been scaled up by a factor of two. This means that each object has been doubled in size, so the total length of the output sequence is now 12.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some sort of operation to the objects in the input sequence, such as movement, scaling, or duplication. However, the exact nature of the transformation is not specified, so we need to be careful when interpreting the input-output pairs.

Now, let's turn our attention to the test case:

Input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To begin, let's analyze the input sequence:

* The first object has color 7.
* There are no objects of color 0 (background color) in the input sequence.
* The last object also has color 7.

Based on the above observations, we can deduce that the input sequence consists of two objects of color 7, with no background color objects. Now, let's apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence:

* Move the first object one position to the right (since there are no background color objects).
* Copy the second object twice, since there are no more objects of color 7 after the first object.

Here's the resulting output sequence:

Output: [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As expected, the first object has been moved one position to the right, and the second object has been copied twice to fill the remaining positions in the output sequence. Since there are no more objects of color 7 after the second object, we stop copying at that point. The resulting output sequence consists of three objects of color 7, with no background color objects.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to elaborate on any aspect of the solution.
