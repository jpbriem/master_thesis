The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, where adjacent pixels of the same value represent objects. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of logical rules that involve object transformations, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9. The output sequence has the same number of pixels, but with some changes in the values.\n\nObject 1 (value 2) has been moved to the left by 2 positions, so it now starts at index 1 and ends at index 2. Object 2 (value 3) has been moved to the right by 2 positions, so it now starts at index 4 and ends at index 4. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9. The output sequence has the same number of pixels, but with some changes in the values.\n\nAll pixels with value 1 have been replaced by value 5. Additionally, all zeros have been removed from the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9. The output sequence has the same number of pixels, but with some changes in the values.\n\nAll pixels with value 1 have been replaced by value 5. Additionally, all zeros have been removed from the output sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation involves applying a set of logical rules to the input sequence, such as moving objects, replacing pixels with specific values, and removing zeros. The exact rules used to transform the input sequence into the output sequence will depend on the specific requirements of the task.\n\nFor the test case input sequence provided, here's my analysis:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nThis input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9. There are several objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1 (value 1): starts at index 1, ends at index 2, and has size 2.\n* Object 2 (value 1): starts at index 4, ends at index 6, and has size 3.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into the corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the logical rules described above. Here's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has the same number of pixels as the input sequence, but with some changes in the values. Object 1 has been moved to the left by 2 positions, while Object 2 has been moved to the right by 3 positions. All other pixels remain unchanged."
