            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 3, representing different colors. The output sequence is obtained by applying some kind of transformation to the input sequence.\n\nFrom the examples given, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n* Objects in the input sequence are transformed in various ways, such as moving, resizing, rotating, and changing color.\n* The relationships between objects in the input and output sequences seem to be important, such as distance, alignment, and overlap.\n* Some objects may be removed or copied from one location to another.\n\nTo solve this task, I will need to carefully analyze each example and identify the specific transformation patterns that are applied to the input sequence. Once I have identified these patterns, I can use them to transform the test input sequence into its corresponding test output sequence.\n\nHere is my analysis of the examples provided:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we see two objects (colors 2 and 3) that are moved and resized. Object 2 is moved to the right and increased in size, while object 3 is moved to the left and decreased in size. The distance between the objects and their alignment relative to each other appear to be important factors in the transformation.\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we see three objects (colors 2, 3, and 0) that are rotated and resized. Object 2 is rotated clockwise and increased in size, while object 3 is rotated counterclockwise and decreased in size. Object 0 is added to the sequence and appears to be a background color.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we see a single object (color 8) that is repeated multiple times. The object is moved to the right and increased in size with each repetition.\n\nBased on these examples, I infer that the transformation pattern involves moving and resizing objects, as well as modifying their colors and positions relative to each other. To transform the test input sequence, I will need to apply these transformation patterns in a specific order to produce the correct output sequence.\n\nHere is my proposed transformation plan:\n\n1. Move object 3 to the right and increase its size to match the size of object 2.\n2. Rotate object 2 clockwise and decrease its size to match the size of object 3.\n3. Add an object of color 0 to the beginning of the sequence.\n4. Repeat object 8 multiple times, moving it to the right with each repetition.\n5. Remove any duplicate objects.\n\nWith these transformation steps, I believe I can produce the correct test output sequence. Here is my predicted output:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nPlease let me know if this is correct, or if there are any additional instructions or constraints that I should be aware of."
