            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining adjacent pixels of the same color into larger objects, while maintaining their relative positions and sizes. Additionally, noise pixels may be introduced or removed, and arithmetical operations may be performed on the objects based on their properties.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis and proposed transformation:\n\n1. Objects:\n\t* Object 1: `color = 2`, `start_index = 1`, `end_index = 2`, `size = 2` (i.e., two consecutive pixels of color 2)\n\t* Object 2: `color = 2`, `start_index = 4`, `end_index = 5`, `size = 1` (i.e., one pixel of color 2)\n2. Relations between objects:\n\t* Distance between Objects 1 and 2: 2 pixels\n3. Noise pixels: None\n4. Arithmetics based on objects:\n\t* Counting: Object 1 has 2 pixels, Object 2 has 1 pixel\n\t* Sorting: Objects 1 and 2 can be sorted in ascending order based on their size (2, 1)\n5. Conditions: None\n\nNow, let me apply the transformation rules to the input sequence:\n\n1. Move Object 1 by 2 pixels to the right:\n\t* New position of Object 1: `start_index = 3`, `end_index = 4`\n2. Scale Object 2 by 2 times its original size:\n\t* New size of Object 2: `size = 2 * 1 = 2`\n3. Remove noise pixels: None\n4. Recolor Object 2 to color 3:\n\t* New color of Object 2: `color = 3`\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence:\n```json\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Objects were moved and resized, but their relative positions and colors remained unchanged.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"Objects were moved and resized, and some noise pixels were added.\",\n\"Overall_Pattern\": \"The input sequence was transformed by applying various operations to the objects, including moving, scaling, and recoloring.\"\n},\n\"Instructions\": \"Apply the transformation rules to the input sequence, considering the objects' positions, sizes, and colors.\",\n\"Transformation\": {\n\"Input\": \"[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"Object_Description\": \"Two objects of color 2, one object of color 3\",\n\"Transformed_Objects\": \"Two objects of color 2, one object of color 3, with adjusted positions and sizes\",\n\"Output\": \"[0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n},\n\"Test_Output\": \"[0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!
