You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color.

For Example_1, we can see that all objects have a size of 7 and are located at positions 1-7 in the input sequence. In the output sequence, these objects remain unchanged, but their background color has been set to 0.

For Example_2, we can see that there is one large object spanning positions 1-5 in the input sequence, with a size of 5. In the output sequence, this object has been split into five smaller objects, each with a size of 1 and located at positions 1-5.

For Example_3, we can see that there is one object spanning positions 1-6 in the input sequence, with a size of 6. In the output sequence, this object has been split into six smaller objects, each with a size of 1 and located at positions 1-6.

Based on these patterns, it appears that the transformation involves applying some sort of splitting or fragmentation operation to larger objects in the input sequence, while leaving smaller objects unchanged.

Now, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:

input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To begin, I will describe the input sequence:

* There are eight objects in the input sequence, each with a size of 1 and a color of 1.
* The objects are located at positions 1-8 in the sequence.

Next, I will describe the desired output sequence:

* The output sequence should have the same length as the input sequence (i.e., 9 elements).
* Each object in the output sequence should have a size of 1 and a color of 0.

Finally, I will provide the actual output sequence:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, the output sequence consists entirely of zeros, indicating that no objects were transformed or moved in the output sequence. Therefore, the transformation pattern for this input sequence is simply to set all objects to have a color of 0.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
