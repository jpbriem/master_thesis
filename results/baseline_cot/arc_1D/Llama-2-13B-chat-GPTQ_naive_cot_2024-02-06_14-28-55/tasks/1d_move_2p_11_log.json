The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence is a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (one of 0, 2, 3, or 5).\n* The output sequence is also a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color.\n* The transformation rule is as follows:\n\t+ If two adjacent pixels have the same color, they form an object.\n\t+ Objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, or changing color.\n\t+ Non-object pixels (i.e., pixels that are not part of an object) do not change their color.\n\nBased on these rules, we can analyze the examples provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all pixels have the same color (0), so there are no objects. Therefore, the output sequence is the same as the input sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the objects are formed by adjacent pixels of the same color (3). When an object is formed, all non-object pixels (i.e., pixels with color 0) become 0. In this case, all pixels except for the ones with color 3 become 0, so the output sequence is different from the input sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, there is one large object consisting of all pixels with color 7. Since all pixels in the object become 0, the output sequence is the same as the input sequence, but with all pixels set to 0.\n\nNow, let me explain how I would approach the task of transforming a new input sequence into its output sequence. Here are the steps I would follow:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence: Scan the input sequence and identify any contiguous sequences of pixels with the same color. These sequences of pixels will form the objects.\n2. Apply transformations to objects: Depending on the specific transformation rule applied, objects may need to be moved, resized, rotated, or changed in color.\n3. Update non-object pixels: Once objects have been transformed, update the colors of non-object pixels accordingly. For example, if an object moves, the pixels it leaves behind may need to be updated to reflect their new color.\n4. Output the transformed sequence: Finally, output the transformed sequence of pixels, represented as a 1D array of integers.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the steps above."
