The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, I can see that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence consists of a series of pixels, each represented by a value from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and 1-9 represent different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example, if two consecutive pixels have the same color, they form an object.\n* The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of predefined rules. These rules involve object transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, and copying objects.\n* The output sequence should also consist of pixels represented by values from 0 to 9, where each pixel value corresponds to the appropriate object color.\n\nBased on the examples provided, I can see that the transformation pattern involves the following operations:\n\n* Moving objects: Objects can be moved horizontally or vertically by a certain number of pixels.\n* Resizing objects: Objects can be resized by changing their size (width and height) by a certain amount.\n* Rotating objects: Objects can be rotated by a certain angle clockwise or counterclockwise.\n* Copying objects: Objects can be copied to create new objects at a different location.\n\nTo perform the transformation, we need to apply these operations to the objects in the input sequence, taking into account their positions, sizes, and colors. We can use arithmetic operations to count and sort the objects, and we may need to use conditions to determine when to apply certain transformations based on the object properties.\n\nNow, let me turn to the test case you provided. Here's the description of the transformation pattern for the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs we can see, the input sequence consists of several objects of different colors, including three objects of color 3 (represented by the value 3). The output sequence has the same number of objects, but their positions, sizes, and colors have been transformed according to the pattern described above.\n\nHere's the transformation I would suggest for this test case:\n\n1. Move the first object of color 3 (value 3) five pixels to the right.\n2. Resize the second object of color 3 (value 3) to twice its original width and height.\n3. Rotate the third object of color 3 (value 3) by 90 degrees clockwise.\n4. Copy the fourth object of color 3 (value 3) and place it two pixels below the original position.\n5. Set the fifth object of color 3 (value 3) to the background color (value 0).\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the desired output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."
