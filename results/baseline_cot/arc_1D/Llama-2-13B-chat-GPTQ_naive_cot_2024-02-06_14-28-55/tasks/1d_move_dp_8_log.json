The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 6]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring. Additionally, there may be conditions or constraints that affect the application of these operations.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are five objects in the input sequence, each consisting of a single pixel of color 3. These objects are located at positions 1-5, respectively.\n* Transformations: To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following transformations to the objects:\n\t+ Move object 1 (position 1) to position 2.\n\t+ Scale object 2 (position 3) by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\n\t+ Recolor object 3 (position 4) to color 6.\n\t+ Remove object 5 (position 5).\n* Output: Applying these transformations results in the following output sequence: `[3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6]`.\n\nHere's the detailed description of the transformations:\n\n1. Move object 1 (position 1) to position 2:\n\t* The first object (color 3) moves one position to the right, so its new position becomes 2.\n2. Scale object 2 (position 3) by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions:\n\t* The second object (color 3) is scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, so its new size becomes 2x2.\n3. Recolor object 3 (position 4) to color 6:\n\t* The third object (color 3) changes color to 6.\n4. Remove object 5 (position 5):\n\t* The fifth object (color 3) is removed entirely.\n\nOverall Pattern: The input-output relationship for all input-output pairs can be described as follows:\n\n* Each input sequence consists of a series of objects, each with a specific color and location.\n* The objects are subject to various transformations, such as movement, scaling, and recoloring.\n* The transformations are applied conditionally, depending on the specific input sequence.\n\nInstructions: To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Apply the appropriate transformations to each object, based on the conditions specified in the input sequence.\n3. Combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence.\n\nTransformation: The input sequence is `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]`. To transform this input sequence, we need to apply the following transformations:\n\n1. Move object 1 (position 1) to position 2.\n2. Scale object 2 (position 3) by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\n3. Recolor object 3 (position 4) to color 6.\n4. Remove object 5 (position 5).\n\nOutput: Applying these transformations results in the output sequence `[3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6]`."
