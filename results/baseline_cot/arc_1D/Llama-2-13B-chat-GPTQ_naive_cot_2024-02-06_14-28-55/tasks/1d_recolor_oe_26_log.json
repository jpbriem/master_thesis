The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions attached to these operations that determine when they should be applied.\n\nTo describe the transformation pattern, we can identify the following key elements:\n\n* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each represented by a single pixel with a specific color (0, 2, 3, etc.). These objects have properties such as size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of the same color), position (represented by the index of the first pixel of the object), and color.\n* Operations: The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence. These operations include:\n\t+ Move: Pixels can be moved to a different location in the output sequence.\n\t+ Scale: Pixels can be resized to a different size in the output sequence.\n\t+ Remove: Pixels can be removed from the output sequence if they do not meet certain conditions.\n\t+ Copy: Pixels can be copied from one location to another in the output sequence.\n\t+ Recolor: Pixels can be given a different color than their original color.\n* Conditions: The operations applied to the objects are conditioned on certain criteria, such as the distance between objects, the alignment of objects, and the overlap of objects.\n\nBased on these elements, we can describe the transformation pattern as follows:\n\n\"The input sequence consists of a series of objects, each represented by a single pixel with a specific color. The objects are subject to various operations based on their properties, such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and recoloring. The conditions for applying these operations are based on the distance between objects, the alignment of objects, and the overlap of objects.\"\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation pattern to the test input sequence:\n\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. We can see that there are five objects in the input sequence, each represented by a group of consecutive pixels with the same color:\n\nObject 1: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7] (color: 2)\nObject 2: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0] (color: 3)\nObject 3: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7] (color: 2)\nObject 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7] (color: 3)\nObject 5: [7, 7, 0, 0, 7] (color: 2)\n\nNext, we need to apply the operations to the objects based on their properties. Here's how we can describe the operations for each object:\n\nObject 1: Move (no operation).\nObject 2: Remove (since it has no overlapping objects).\nObject 3: Scale (downsize to 1 pixel since it is the smallest object).\nObject 4: Copy (move to the beginning of the sequence).\nObject 5: Recolor (change color to 3).\n\nAfter applying these operations, we get the following output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has undergone several changes compared to the input sequence. Objects have been moved, resized, removed, and recolored based on their properties and the conditions specified in the transformation pattern."
