The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color.\n\nTo describe the transformation pattern, we can start by identifying the objects in the input sequence. In the given input sequence [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], there are three objects:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6] (six consecutive pixels of color 6)\n* Object 2: [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0] (three consecutive pixels of color 6, followed by three pixels of background color 0)\n* Object 3: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] (six consecutive pixels of color 6)\n\nNow, let's describe the transformation pattern for each object:\n\nObject 1:\n\n* Move: All six pixels of Object 1 move together by one position to the right (i.e., their positions become [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]).\n\nObject 2:\n\n* Scale: Object 2 scales down by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions (i.e., its size reduces to half).\n\nObject 3:\n\n* Remove: Object 3 disappears completely (i.e., all six pixels of Object 3 are removed).\n\nBased on these transformations, we can now describe the overall pattern for the input-output pairs:\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n* Any object of color 6 in the input sequence will move one position to the right.\n* Any object of color 6 in the input sequence will scale down by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\n* Any object of color 6 in the input sequence will disappear completely.\n\nUsing this understanding of the transformation pattern, we can now create the test output sequence for the given input sequence. Here's the calculation:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\nHere's the explanation of the transformation for each object:\n\nObject 1:\n\n* Move: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6] becomes [1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5] (moves one position to the right)\n\nObject 2:\n\n* Scale: [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0] becomes [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0] (scales down by a factor of 2)\n\nObject 3:\n\n* Remove: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] disappears completely (removed)\n\nTherefore, the final output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3].\n\nI hope this helps!
