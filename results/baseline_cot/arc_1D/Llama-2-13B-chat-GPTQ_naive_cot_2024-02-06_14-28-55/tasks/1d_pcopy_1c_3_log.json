The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my understanding of the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., 1 pixel).\n\t+ Resizing: Pixels can change size by a factor (e.g., 2x larger or smaller).\n\t+ Color changes: Pixels can change color, either to a new color or back to the background color (0).\n\t+ Overlapping: Pixels can overlap each other, causing one pixel to cover another.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be replaced with noise pixels (randomly chosen integer value between 1 and 9).\n* Arithmetic operations: Pixel values can be modified using basic arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) based on the object properties.\n* Conditional logic: Transformations can be conditioned based on specific rules or conditions (e.g., only apply a transformation if a certain condition is met).\n\nWith this understanding, let's analyze the given input and output sequences:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all pixels have their color set to 7, indicating that they have been overwritten by a single object. There is no movement, resizing, or color changing involved.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all pixels have their color set to 3, indicating that they have been overwritten by a single object. There is no movement, resizing, or color changing involved.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nIn this example, all pixels have their color set to 5, indicating that they have been overwritten by a single object. There is no movement, resizing, or color changing involved.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given test case input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, here's my prediction for the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, all pixels have had their color set to 4, indicating that they have been overwritten by a single object. There is no movement, resizing, or color changing involved.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the transformation pattern and how to approach the task at hand! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
