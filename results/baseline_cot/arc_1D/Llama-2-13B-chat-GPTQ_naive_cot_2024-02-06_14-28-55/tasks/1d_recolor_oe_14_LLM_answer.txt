[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.

To begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:

Input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, let me analyze the patterns in the input sequence:

* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each consisting of a group of consecutive pixels with the same color. For example, there are three objects of color 9 in the input sequence: [9, 9, 9].
* Noise pixels: There are also some noise pixels in the input sequence, which are pixels that do not belong to any object. For example, there are two noise pixels of color 0 in the input sequence: [0, 0].
* Arithmetical operations: Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence undergoes some arithmetical operations, such as counting and sorting. For example, the input sequence contains a sequence of nine pixels of color 9, followed by a sequence of nine pixels of color 0. This suggests that the input sequence may be subject to some sort of counting or sorting operation.

Now, let me describe the desired output sequence:

Output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output sequence is derived from the input sequence through a series of transformations that involve object movements, resizing, and color changes. Specifically, it seems that the objects in the input sequence are moved, resized, and recolored in various ways to produce the output sequence.

To perform these transformations, I will need to carefully examine the input sequence and identify the objects, their properties (such as size and position), and the relationships between them. Once I have identified these properties and relationships, I can apply the appropriate transformations to produce the desired output sequence.

Here is my plan of action:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their properties (such as size and position).
2. Apply transformations to the objects based on their properties and the relationships between them. These transformations may include moving objects, resizing them, changing their color, or removing them altogether.
3. Use arithmetical operations to count and sort the objects in the output sequence.
4. Output the final output sequence in numpy array format.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you.
