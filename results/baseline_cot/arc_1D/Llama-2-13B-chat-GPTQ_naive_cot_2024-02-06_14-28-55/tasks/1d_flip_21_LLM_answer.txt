You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, changing size, and sometimes disappearing or appearing. The noise pixels also seem to play a role in the transformation.

For the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I observe:

* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color 6 (represented by the numbers 6) and one object of color 7 (represented by the number 7). These objects are located at positions 1-3, 4-5, and 6-7, respectively.
* Relations between objects: The objects are aligned horizontally and vertically, with some objects overlapping each other.
* Noise pixels: There are several noise pixels scattered throughout the input sequence.

Based on these observations, here's my interpretation of the transformation pattern:

* Objects:
	+ Move: Objects may move horizontally or vertically, but they do not change size.
	+ Scale: Objects may change size, but only by a factor of 2 (i.e., either double or halve their original size).
	+ Remove: Objects may disappear if they are completely surrounded by noise pixels.
	+ Copy: New objects may appear as copies of existing objects.
	+ Recolor: Objects may change color, but only to a neighboring color (i.e., 6 becomes 7, or 7 becomes 6).
* Noise pixels: Noise pixels may change value, but only to a neighboring value (i.e., 0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0).

With these patterns in mind, let's apply them to the given input sequence:

1. Objects:
	* Move: Objects 1 and 2 move horizontally to positions 2 and 3, respectively.
	* Scale: Object 3 scales up by a factor of 2 to occupy positions 4-5.
	* Remove: No objects are removed.
	* Copy: No new objects are copied.
	* Recolor: Object 7 changes color to 6.
2. Noise pixels:
	* Change value: Some noise pixels change value, as follows:
		+ Position 0: 0 becomes 1.
		+ Position 2: 1 becomes 0.
		+ Position 4: 0 becomes 1.
		+ Position 6: 1 becomes 0.

Now, let's create the test output sequence based on these transformations:

output = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's a breakdown of the output sequence:

* Objects:
	+ Object 1: starts at position 1, ends at position 2, size 2.
	+ Object 2: starts at position 2, ends at position 3, size 2.
	+ Object 3: starts at position 4, ends at position 5, size 2.
	+ Object 7: starts at position 6, ends at position 7, size 1.
* Noise pixels:
	+ Positions 0, 2, 4, and 6: change value from 0 to 1.
	+ Positions 1, 3, 5, and 7: change value from 1 to 0.

And there you have it! This is my interpretation of the transformation pattern and the resulting test output sequence for the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
