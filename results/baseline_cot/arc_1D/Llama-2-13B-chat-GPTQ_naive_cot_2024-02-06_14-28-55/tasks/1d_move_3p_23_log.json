            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves making certain objects larger or smaller, while also changing their position and color. Additionally, some objects may be removed or copied.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I observe:\n\n* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color `3` (represented by the numbers `3`) and one object of color `0` (represented by the number `0`).\n* Relations between objects: The two objects of color `3` are adjacent to each other, and they are both located near the beginning of the sequence. The object of color `0` is located at the end of the sequence.\n* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, here's my interpretation of the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects: The two objects of color `3` will be made larger, while the object of color `0` will be removed.\n* Relations between objects: The two objects of color `3` will be moved closer together, and the object of color `0` will be replaced with a new object of color `3`.\n* Noise pixels: None.\n\nNow, let me apply this transformation pattern to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nOutput: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nAs you can see, the only change made was the removal of the object of color `0` and the replacement of the two objects of color `3` with larger versions of themselves. The resulting output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
