The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence has a specific color (0, 2, 3, or 4) and a specific size (2, 1, or 4 pixels long).\n* Objects of the same color are grouped together and can overlap each other.\n* Objects can move horizontally, but their positions relative to each other remain unchanged.\n* Some objects can change color (recolor) while others stay the same.\n* Noise pixels (0) may appear randomly throughout the sequence.\n\nWith these observations in mind, here's the description of the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs:\n\nOverall Pattern:\nThe input sequence consists of a series of objects with specific colors and sizes, arranged horizontally. The output sequence transforms these objects according to certain rules, resulting in a new sequence with modified objects.\n\nInstructions:\nTo transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify objects of the same color.\n2. Apply the following transformations to each object:\na. Move objects horizontally to create overlaps.\nb. Recolor objects based on specified rules.\nc. Remove noise pixels.\n3. Sort objects by color and size.\n\nTransformation:\nThe input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0].\n\nObject Description:\nThe input sequence contains the following objects:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object_2: {color: 2, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}\n* Object_3: {color: 3, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n* Object_4: {color: 4, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 4}\n\nTransformed Objects:\nAfter applying the transformations, the objects in the input sequence become:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}\n* Object_3: {color: 4, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n* Object_4: {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 4}\n\nOutput:\nThe resulting test output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
