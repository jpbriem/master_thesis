The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing their color.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color. The objects are:\n\t+ Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3} (colors: 2, 2, 2)\n\t+ Object_2: {color: 2, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 2} (colors: 2, 2)\n\t+ Object_3: {color: 2, start_index: 8, end_index: 10, size: 2} (colors: 2, 2)\n\t+ Background: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 11, size: 11}\n* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n* Transformation rules: Based on the examples provided, the transformation rules seem to involve moving objects, resizing them, and changing their color. Specifically, the rules suggest the following operations:\n\t+ Move objects horizontally by a fixed amount (e.g., Object_1 moves 2 positions to the right).\n\t+ Resize objects by a factor (e.g., Object_2 doubles in size).\n\t+ Change object color (e.g., Object_3 changes from color 2 to color 1).\n* Output sequence: Applying these transformation rules to the input sequence yields the following output sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nAs requested, here's the description of the transformation in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Object_1\": \"moved 2 positions to the right\",\n\"Object_2\": \"doubled in size\",\n\"Object_3\": \"changed color from 2 to 1\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"applied transformation rules to move, resize, and change object colors\",\n\"instructions\": \"apply the transformation rules to the input sequence\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"list of objects in the input sequence, including their color, start index, end index, and size\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"list of objects in the output sequence, including their color, start index, end index, and size\",\n\"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\"\n}"
