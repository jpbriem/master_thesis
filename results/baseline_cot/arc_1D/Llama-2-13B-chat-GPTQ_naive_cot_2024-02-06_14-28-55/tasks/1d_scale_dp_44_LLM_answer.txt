[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4]
output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the information provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.

For Example_1, we can see that the input sequence consists of repeating patterns of three identical pixels (colors 7) separated by two background pixels (color 0). The output sequence simply repeats the same pattern, but with each group of three pixels shifted one position to the right. This means that each object (group of three pixels) has been moved one position to the right, while maintaining their original size and color.

For Example_2, we can see that the input sequence consists of repeating patterns of three identical pixels (colors 3) separated by two background pixels (color 0). Similar to Example_1, the output sequence simply repeats the same pattern, but with each group of three pixels shifted one position to the right. However, in this case, the objects (groups of three pixels) have been resized to twice their original size.

For Example_3, we can see that the input sequence consists of a single object (a group of eight pixels all having color 8) followed by four background pixels (color 0). The output sequence simply duplicates the object, creating two groups of eight pixels all having color 8, separated by four background pixels (color 0).

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving and resizing objects, while maintaining their original color. Additionally, there may be some sort of conditionality involved, as the output sequence for Example_2 differs from the other two examples.

Now, let's consider the test case input sequence: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0]. To transform this sequence, we need to apply the transformation pattern described above. Here's how I would do it step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence:

Object 1: [5, 5, 5] (color 5, start index 1, end index 3, size 3)

Object 2: [0, 0, 4] (color 4, start index 4, end index 6, size 2)

Note that there are only two objects in this input sequence.

2. Apply the transformation pattern:

a. Move Object 1 one position to the right:

New location of Object 1: [6, 5, 5]

b. Resize Object 2 to twice its original size:

New size of Object 2: 4 (twice the original size of 2)

c. Maintain the background color (color 0) for the remaining positions:

Output sequence: [6, 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Therefore, the test output sequence would be:

numpy array([6, 5, 5, 7, 7, 4, 0])

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
