            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:\n\n* Moving objects (represented by non-zero values) to different positions in the sequence\n* Changing the color of objects (represented by changes in the value of the corresponding element in the output sequence)\n* Removing objects (represented by zero-valued elements in the output sequence)\n* Copying objects (represented by unchanged values in the output sequence)\n\nAdditionally, there may be some arithmetical operations based on the objects, such as counting or sorting.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to carefully analyze each example and identify the specific transformations applied to the input sequence. Here's my analysis of the three examples provided:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we see two objects (represented by the values 4 and 2) that are moved to different positions in the output sequence. Specifically, object 4 is moved to the first position, while object 2 is moved to the last position. Additionally, object 4 is resized to twice its original size.\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we see eight objects (represented by the values 8 and 0) that are moved to different positions in the output sequence. Specifically, objects 8 are moved to the first seven positions, while object 0 is moved to the eighth position. Additionally, objects 8 are resized to half their original size.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we see six objects (represented by the values 6 and 0) that are moved to different positions in the output sequence. Specifically, objects 6 are moved to the first five positions, while object 0 is moved to the sixth position. Additionally, objects 6 are resized to twice their original size.\n\nBased on these observations, we can deduce the general pattern of the transformation:\n\n* Objects are moved to different positions in the output sequence.\n* Objects are resized based on their original size.\n* Some objects are removed from the output sequence.\n\nNow let's apply this pattern to the given test case:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence, we need to follow the above pattern. Here's the transformed output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has undergone the following transformations:\n\n* Object 7 is moved to the first position.\n* Object 7 is resized to four times its original size.\n* All other objects (values 0) are removed from the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to explain anything else."
