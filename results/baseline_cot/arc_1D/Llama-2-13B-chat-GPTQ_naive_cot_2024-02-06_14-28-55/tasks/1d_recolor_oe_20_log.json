            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some logical rules and patterns.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* The input sequence consists of 18 pixels, each with a value from 0 to 9.\n* There are several groups of adjacent pixels with the same color (e.g., [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0], etc.). These groups represent objects in the scene.\n* Some pixels have a value of 0, indicating the background color.\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* The output sequence also consists of 18 pixels, each with a value from 0 to 9.\n* The objects in the input sequence have undergone some transformations, such as movement, resizing, and color changes.\n* The output sequence reflects the relationships between the objects, such as overlapping and distance.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here are the logical rules and patterns that seem to apply:\n\n1. Objects can move horizontally and vertically.\n2. Objects can change size, either growing or shrinking.\n3. Objects can change color.\n4. Objects can overlap or be separated by empty space.\n5. The background color is always 0.\n\nNow, let me analyze the test input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\nHere's my interpretation of the input sequence:\n\n* The input sequence consists of 18 pixels, each with a value from 0 to 9.\n* There are several objects in the scene, including a large object consisting of four pixels with the value 9 (representing a dark blue color), and a smaller object consisting of three pixels with the value 0 (representing a light blue color).\n* The background color is 0.\n\nNow, let me generate the output sequence based on the logical rules and patterns observed in the examples:\n\nOutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nHere's my reasoning for the output sequence:\n\n* The large object consisting of four pixels with the value 9 moves horizontally one pixel to the right and vertically two pixels down, changing size to three pixels wide and six pixels tall.\n* The smaller object consisting of three pixels with the value 0 moves horizontally one pixel to the left and vertically two pixels up, changing size to three pixels wide and six pixels tall.\n* The background color remains unchanged at 0.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
