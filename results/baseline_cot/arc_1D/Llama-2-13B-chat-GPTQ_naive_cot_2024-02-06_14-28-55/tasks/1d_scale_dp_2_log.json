The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, let me describe the pattern I observe in these examples:\n\n* Each input sequence consists of a series of objects, where each object has a specific color (represented by a number from 0 to 8).\n* Each object has a fixed size (represented by the number of consecutive elements of the same color in the input sequence).\n* Objects can overlap or touch each other, but they never overlap completely.\n* There are also noise pixels scattered throughout the input sequence, represented by the value 0.\n* The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by applying a set of transformations to the objects, including moving, scaling, and rotating them.\n* The transformations are conditioned on the properties of the objects, such as their size, position, and color.\n\nBased on this analysis, I suggest the following transformation pattern for the input-output pairs:\n\n1. Move objects: Objects can move horizontally or vertically by a certain distance, depending on their properties.\n2. Scale objects: Objects can scale up or down by a factor, depending on their properties.\n3. Rotate objects: Objects can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise by a certain angle, depending on their properties.\n4. Remove objects: Objects can be removed if they satisfy certain conditions, such as being fully contained within another object.\n5. Copy objects: New objects can be created by copying existing ones.\n6. Recolor objects: Objects can change color based on certain conditions.\n\nUsing this pattern, we can generate the output sequence for any given input sequence. To do so, we need to apply the appropriate transformations to each object in the input sequence, taking into account their properties and the relationships between them.\n\nFor the test case input sequence provided, here's the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
