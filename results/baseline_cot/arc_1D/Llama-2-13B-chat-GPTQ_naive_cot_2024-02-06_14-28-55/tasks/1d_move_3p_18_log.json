            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of the three examples:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of zeros with one object at index 7, which has size 3 and color 7. The output sequence consists of zeros with one object at index 7, but now it has size 0 and color 0. This means that the object at index 7 was \"removed\" from the input sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have an input sequence of ones with one object at index 6, which has size 6 and color 6. The output sequence consists of zeros with one object at index 6, but now it has size 6 and color 0. This means that the object at index 6 was \"copied\" to the beginning of the output sequence, but its color was changed to zero.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of fives with two objects at indices 5 and 5, both having size 5 and color 5. The output sequence consists of zeros with two objects at indices 5 and 5, but now they have size 0 and color 0. This means that both objects were \"removed\" from the input sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some sort of operation to objects in the input sequence, possibly involving moving, resizing, or changing the color of objects. To transform the test input sequence, I would need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate operation(s) to produce the desired output sequence.\n\nTo summarize, the overall pattern of the transformation seems to involve manipulating objects in the input sequence, possibly involving moves, resizes, and color changes. The specific instructions for each input-output pair are as follows:\n\n* Example 1: Remove the object at index 7.\n* Example 2: Copy the object at index 6 to the beginning of the output sequence, but change its color to zero.\n* Example 3: Remove both objects at indices 5 and 5.\n\nFor the test input sequence, I would need to carefully examine each object and apply the appropriate operation(s) to produce the desired output sequence. Here is the description of the needed transformation actions:\n\n* Object at index 0: None (keep the zero).\n* Object at index 1: Remove (set to zero).\n* Object at index 2: Remove (set to zero).\n* Object at index 3: Remove (set to zero).\n* Object at index 4: Copy to beginning of output sequence, change color to zero.\n* Object at index 5: Remove (set to zero).\n* Object at index 6: Remove (set to zero).\n* Object at index 7: Remove (set to zero).\n\nFinally, here is the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format:\n\narray([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4])\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."
