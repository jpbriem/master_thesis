[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, where adjacent pixels of the same value represent objects. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of logical rules that involve object transformations, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.

Here's my understanding of the task so far:

* Input: A sequence of integers from 0 to 9, where each integer represents a pixel color.
* Output: A transformed sequence of integers from 0 to 9, where each integer still represents a pixel color but has been transformed according to the given rules.
* Rules:
	+ Objects: Transformations such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor. Relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
	+ Noise pixels: Add random pixels to the output sequence.
	+ Arithmetics: Perform basic arithmetic operations on object properties, such as counting and sorting.
	+ Conditions: Apply conditional logic to determine the outcome of object transformations.

To begin, let me describe the input and output sequences for Example_1:

Input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0]

In this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with the value 2, indicating that they belong to the same object. The output sequence has several changes:

* Pixels with value 2 have been moved to different positions in the output sequence.
* Some pixels have been removed (indicated by zeros).
* The last pixel (value 9) has been added to the output sequence.

Now, let me describe the instructions for the task:

Instructions:

* Transform the input sequence into the output sequence using the given rules.
* Focus on the size, position, and color of objects in the input and output sequences.
* Use the provided examples to guide your understanding of the task.

Based on these instructions, here's my plan for transforming the input sequence:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color values.
2. Apply transformations to objects based on their properties, such as moving them to different positions, scaling them, or removing them.
3. Add noise pixels to the output sequence to simulate random variations in the image.
4. Perform arithmetical operations on object properties to create interesting patterns and effects.
5. Apply conditional logic to determine the outcome of object transformations based on specific rules.

With these steps in mind, I will now proceed to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence. Please provide the input sequence, and I will generate the output sequence accordingly.
