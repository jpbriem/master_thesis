[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of the three examples:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence of zeros and ones, where each one represents a colored object (red). The output sequence has the same number of elements as the input, but each element is now twice the size of the original object. This suggests that the transformation applies some kind of scaling operation to the objects. Specifically, each object is doubled in size, keeping its original position and color.

Example 2:
Here, we have an input sequence of fives and zeros, where each five represents a blue object and each zero represents a background color. The output sequence has the same number of elements as the input, but each element is now the same value (five) regardless of its original color. This implies that the transformation applies some kind of copying or repetition operation to the objects. Specifically, each object is copied five times, filling the entire output sequence with the same color.

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence with a mix of red and blue objects, along with some background colors. The output sequence has the same number of elements as the input, but each element is now either red or blue, depending on the color of the original object. This suggests that the transformation applies some kind of color-based operation to the objects. Specifically, each object is checked to see if it matches a specific color (red or blue), and if it does, the output element is set to that color. If it doesn't match, the output element remains unchanged.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some kind of operation to objects in the input sequence, possibly involving scaling, copying, or color-based manipulation. To determine the exact pattern, let's examine the given test case:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

From the input, we can identify several objects:

* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0] (size: 8, color: 0, position: 0-7)
* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0] (size: 8, color: 0, position: 8-15)

Now, let's apply the transformation pattern to this input:

1. Check if any objects overlap or touch each other. If they do, merge them into a single object.
2. Apply a scaling operation to each object, doubling its size.
3. If the object overlaps with the background color (zero), change its color to the background color.

With these rules, we can transform the input sequence as follows:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

As expected, the output sequence has the same number of elements as the input, but each element has been modified according to the transformation pattern. Each object has been doubled in size, and any overlapping objects have been merged into a single object. Additionally, any objects that touched the background color have had their color changed to the background color.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
