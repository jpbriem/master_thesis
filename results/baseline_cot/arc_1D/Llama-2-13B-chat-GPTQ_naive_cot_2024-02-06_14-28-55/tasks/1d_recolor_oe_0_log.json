            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing their color.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color. The objects are:\n\t+ Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2} (represented by the first two pixels with color 2)\n\t+ Object_2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3} (represented by the next three pixels with color 2)\n\t+ Object_3: {color: 2, start_index: 8, end_index: 10, size: 2} (represented by the last two pixels with color 2)\n* Transformations: To apply the transformation pattern, we need to consider the relationships between these objects and the noise pixels. Here are some observations:\n\t+ Distance: Object_1 and Object_2 are adjacent and have a distance of 1 pixel between them. Object_2 and Object_3 are also adjacent and have a distance of 1 pixel between them.\n\t+ Alignment: All objects are aligned horizontally, meaning they have the same x-coordinate.\n\t+ Overlap: Object_1 overlaps with Object_2 by 1 pixel, and Object_2 overlaps with Object_3 by 1 pixel.\n\t+ Containment: Object_1 and Object_2 are contained within Object_3.\n* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n* Arithmetic operations: Based on the object relationships, we can apply the following arithmetic operations to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\t+ Move Object_1 1 pixel to the right: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0] becomes [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\t+ Resize Object_2 by -1 pixel: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0] becomes [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\t+ Remove Object_3: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0] becomes [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on these transformations, the expected output sequence would be:\n\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
