            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, depending on their properties such as size, position, and color.\n\nFor Example_1, we can see that all objects have a size of 2 and are located at positions 1, 2, and 3. In the output sequence, these objects are moved to positions 0 and 2, and their size is increased to 3. Additionally, the object at position 4 has a size of 1 and is moved to position 4.\n\nFor Example_2, we can see that all objects have a size of 5 and are located at positions 1, 2, and 3. In the output sequence, these objects are resized to 0 and are moved to positions 0, 2, and 4.\n\nFor Example_3, we can see that all objects have a size of 8 and are located at positions 1, 2, and 3. In the output sequence, these objects are resized to 0 and are moved to positions 0, 2, and 4.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer that the transformation involves moving objects to different positions, resizing them, and changing their color.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the given test case:\n\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin with, we can observe that there are three objects in the input sequence, each with a size of 5 and located at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n\nObject 1 (position 1) has a size of 5 and is colored 0.\n\nObject 2 (position 2) has a size of 5 and is colored 1.\n\nObject 3 (position 3) has a size of 5 and is colored 0.\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation rules to this input sequence:\n\n1. Move Object 1 (size 5, color 0) to position 0:\n\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n2. Resize Object 2 (size 5, color 1) to size 3:\n\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n3. Move Object 3 (size 5, color 0) to position 2:\n\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nAnd finally, we need to update the output sequence with the transformed objects:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this task is:\n\n* Move objects to different positions\n* Resize objects\n* Change object colors\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to explain anything else."
