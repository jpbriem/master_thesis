[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:

* Objects: The input and output sequences can be divided into smaller objects, represented by contiguous sequences of pixels with the same color. These objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, and changing color.
* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be considered noise and can be removed or replaced with background color (0).
* Arithmetics: The relationships between objects can be expressed through arithmetic operations, such as counting, sorting, and summing up the object sizes.
* Conditions: The transformations may be conditioned upon certain criteria, such as the distance between objects, their alignment, overlap, or containment.

Now, let me analyze the given test case:

Input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, we can identify the following objects in the input sequence:

Object 1: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] - This object consists of nine pixels of color 9, followed by three pixels of color 0.

Object 2: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] - This object consists of ten pixels of color 9.

Noise pixels: [0, 0, 0] - These three pixels are considered noise and can be replaced with background color (0).

Now, let's apply the transformation rules to the input sequence:

1. Move Object 1 five positions to the right, so that it overlaps with Object 2:

New position of Object 1: [5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]

2. Resize Object 2 to six pixels, so that it aligns with Object 1:

New size of Object 2: [6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

3. Remove the noise pixels [0, 0, 0]:

New input sequence: [5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Finally, applying the instructions provided, we need to create the resulting test output sequence. Based on the examples, we can expect the output sequence to consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position.

Output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9]

Therefore, the test output sequence for the given input sequence would be:

[0, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
