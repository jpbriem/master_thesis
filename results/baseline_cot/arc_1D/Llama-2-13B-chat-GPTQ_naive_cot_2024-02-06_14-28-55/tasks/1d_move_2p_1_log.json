The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:\n\n* Objects: The input and output sequences can be divided into objects, which are groups of adjacent pixels of the same color. For example, in Example_1, the input sequence consists of five objects of color 5, each with a size of 5 pixels. In Example_2, there are three objects of color 1, each with a size of 3 pixels.\n* Transformations: The transformations applied to the objects seem to be based on logical rules, such as moving objects, changing their size, or recoloring them. For instance, in Example_1, the objects are moved one position to the right, while in Example_2, they are shrunk to half their original size.\n* Noise pixels: There are also noise pixels scattered throughout the input sequences, which do not belong to any object. These pixels seem to be unaffected by the transformations.\n* Arithmetic operations: The transformations involve arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, and counting the number of objects. For example, in Example_1, the objects are counted and then sorted according to their size.\n* Conditional logic: The transformations are also conditioned upon certain criteria, such as the distance between objects or their overlap. For instance, in Example_2, objects that are too close to each other are merged into a single object.\n\nBased on these observations, I would suggest that the overall pattern of the transformation is to apply a series of logical operations to the input sequence, taking into account the properties of the objects and the noise pixels.\n\nNow, let me turn to the specific task at hand. Given the input sequence `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, I would transform it as follows:\n\n1. Move all objects one position to the right, so that the first object becomes `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.\n2. Shrink all objects by half their original size, so that the second object becomes `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.\n3. Remove all noise pixels, leaving us with `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence would be `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
