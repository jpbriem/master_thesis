You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects of the same color into larger objects, while also applying some noise pixels to the output sequence.

For Example_1, we can see that the input sequence consists of six objects of color 6, each with a size of 2. In the output sequence, these objects are combined into three larger objects of size 6, with the remaining two objects being removed. Additionally, there are four noise pixels added to the output sequence.

For Example_2, we can see that the input sequence consists of four objects of color 4, each with a size of 2. In the output sequence, these objects are combined into two larger objects of size 4, with the remaining two objects being removed. Additionally, there are four noise pixels added to the output sequence.

For Example_3, we can see that the input sequence consists of six objects of color 6, each with a size of 2. In the output sequence, these objects are combined into three larger objects of size 6, with the remaining three objects being removed. Additionally, there are six noise pixels added to the output sequence.

Based on these patterns, we can infer that the desired transformation is to combine adjacent objects of the same color into larger objects, while removing any remaining isolated objects. Additionally, noise pixels may be added to the output sequence.

To perform the transformation on the given input sequence, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions. Here's how we can do it:

Object_1: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

* Color: 7 (since all elements in this object are 7)
* Size: 5 (since there are five elements in this object)
* Position: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (since these are the indices of the elements in the input sequence)

Object_2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9]

* Color: 6 (since all elements in this object are 6)
* Size: 8 (since there are eight elements in this object)
* Position: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] (since these are the indices of the elements in the input sequence)

Now that we have identified the objects in the input sequence, we can apply the transformation rules as follows:

1. Combine adjacent objects of the same color into larger objects. Since Object_1 and Object_2 have the same color (7), we can combine them into one larger object.
2. Remove any remaining isolated objects. Since there are no isolated objects in the input sequence, we don't need to take any action here.
3. Add noise pixels. We can add four noise pixels to the output sequence, since there are four gaps in the input sequence where objects could potentially be placed.

Here's the resulting output sequence:

[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to explain anything else.
