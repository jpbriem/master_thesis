The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects (represented by non-zero values) around and resizing them, while keeping their relative positions and colors unchanged. Additionally, there are some noise pixels (represented by zero values) that appear to be randomly distributed throughout the sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, here is my understanding of the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Objects can move left, right, up, or down by a fixed amount (e.g., 2 pixels).\n\t+ Resizing: Objects can change size, either growing or shrinking by a fixed amount (e.g., 2 pixels).\n\t+ Alignment: Objects must align with each other horizontally and vertically.\n* Noise pixels:\n\t+ Random placement: Noise pixels can appear anywhere in the sequence, regardless of object boundaries.\n\t+ Fixed color: All noise pixels have the same color (e.g., 3).\n\nNow, let me apply this understanding to the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nFirst, let's identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] (size: 5 pixels, color: 2)\nObject 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 5 pixels, color: 0)\n\nNext, we need to apply the transformation rules to these objects:\n\nFor Object 1:\n\n* Move 2 pixels to the right: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]\n* Resize to 4 pixels: [2, 2, 2, 2, 4] becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]\n\nFor Object 2:\n\n* Move 2 pixels to the left: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, -2]\n* Resize to 2 pixels: [0, 0, 0, 0, -2] becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, -2]\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 3]\n\nAs you can see, the objects have moved and resized according to the transformation pattern, while the noise pixels have remained unchanged.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to perform additional tests."
