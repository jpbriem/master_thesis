prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Specifically, the objects appear to be moved, resized, and recolored based on their positions and sizes. Additionally, there seem to be some noise pixels added to the output sequence.

To describe the transformation pattern more formally, we can define the following rules:

1. Objects are moved based on their positions: if an object is at position i in the input sequence, it will be moved to position i+1 in the output sequence (modulo the sequence length).
2. Objects are resized based on their sizes: if an object has size j in the input sequence, it will be resized to size j+1 in the output sequence (modulo the sequence length).
3. Objects are recolored based on their colors: if an object has color c in the input sequence, it will be recolored to color c+1 in the output sequence (modulo the number of colors).
4. Noise pixels are added to the output sequence: each pixel in the output sequence has a 25% chance of being set to a noise pixel value (i.e., a random value between 0 and 8).

Now, let's apply these rules to the given input sequence:

input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

First, we'll move the objects based on their positions:

* Object at position 0: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [1, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Object at position 1: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [2, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
*... and so on

Next, we'll resize the objects based on their sizes:

* Object at position 0: [1, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [1, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size increased by 1)
* Object at position 1: [2, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [2, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size increased by 1)
*... and so on

Finally, we'll recolor the objects based on their colors:

* Object at position 0: [1, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color increased by 1)
* Object at position 1: [2, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [2, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color increased by 1)
*... and so on

Applying these rules to the entire input sequence yields the following output sequence:

output: [1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
