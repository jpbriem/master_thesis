            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and copying them.\n\nFor Example_1, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and ones, where each one corresponds to a pixel of color 3. The output sequence has the same length, but with some changes:\n\n* All the zeros have been replaced with zeros.\n* Each group of three consecutive ones (i.e., [1, 1, 1]) has been replaced with a single one (i.e., [3]).\n\nIn other words, the transformation takes any group of three or more consecutive pixels of color 3 and replaces them with a single pixel of color 3. This creates a checkerboard pattern in the output sequence.\n\nFor Example_2, we can see that the input sequence is similar to Example_1, but with an additional pixel of color 0 at the beginning. The output sequence again has the same length, but with some changes:\n\n* All the zeros have been replaced with zeros, just like in Example_1.\n* Each group of two or more consecutive ones (i.e., [1, 1, 1, 1]) has been replaced with a single pixel of color 3.\n\nIn other words, the transformation takes any group of two or more consecutive pixels of color 3 and replaces them with a single pixel of color 3. This creates a checkerboard pattern in the output sequence, but with a slight variation compared to Example_1.\n\nFor Example_3, we can see that the input sequence consists solely of pixels of color 7. The output sequence has the same length, but with some changes:\n\n* All the pixels of color 7 have been replaced with pixels of color 3.\n\nIn other words, the transformation takes any pixel of color 7 and replaces it with a pixel of color 3. This results in an output sequence consisting entirely of pixels of color 3.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and copying them. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve replacing groups of adjacent pixels of the same color with a single pixel of that color.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:\n\ninput: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, I will describe the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, size: 1}\n* Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 1}\n* Object_3: {color: 7, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1}\n* Object_4: {color: 7, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 1}\n\nNext, I will describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, size: 1}\n* Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 1}\n* Object_3: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1}\n* Object_4: {color: 3, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 1}\n\nFinally, I will create the resulting test output sequence:\n\noutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nAs requested, I will return the created test output sequence in numpy array format:\n\nnumpy.array([3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3])\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
