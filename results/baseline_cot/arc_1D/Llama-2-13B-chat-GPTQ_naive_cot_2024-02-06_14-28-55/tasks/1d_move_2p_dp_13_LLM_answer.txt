prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:

* Removing all zeros (representing the background color) from the input sequence
* Moving objects (pixels with the same color) together if they are adjacent
* Scaling objects up or down based on their size
* Changing the color of some objects

Here's a breakdown of each example:

Example 1:

Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, all zeros (background color) are removed from the input sequence, leaving only the object pixels. The objects are not moved or scaled.

Example 2:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]

In this example, all non-zero pixels (objects) are moved together if they are adjacent, regardless of their color. The objects are not scaled or changed in color.

Example 3:

Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]

In this example, all objects (pixels with the same color) are scaled up by a factor of 4, regardless of their original size. The objects are not moved or changed in color.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving objects together if they are adjacent, scaling objects up or down based on their size, and changing the color of some objects.

Now, let me explain how I would approach the task of transforming the given input sequence. First, I would start by creating a list of objects in the input sequence, where each object is represented as a dictionary with the following keys: `start_index`, `end_index`, `size`, and `color`. For example, the input sequence `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` would result in the following list of objects:
```less
[
    {
        "start_index": 1,
        "end_index": 2,
        "size": 2,
        "color": 7
    },
    {
        "start_index": 3,
        "end_index": 4,
        "size": 2,
        "color": 7
    },
    {
        "start_index": 5,
        "end_index": 6,
        "size": 2,
        "color": 7
    },
    {
        "start_index": 7,
        "end_index": 8,
        "size": 2,
        "color": 7
    },
    {
        "start_index": 9,
        "end_index": 10,
        "size": 2,
        "color": 7
    }
]
```
Next, I would loop through each object in the list and perform the necessary transformations based on the rules described above. For example, if an object has a size of 2 and is adjacent to another object with the same color, I would move the two objects together so that they share a boundary. If an object has a size of 1 and is not adjacent to any other objects, I would remove it from the sequence.

Finally, I would create the resulting output sequence by iterating through the list of objects and constructing the output sequence one pixel at a time. Here's the complete code in Python:
```python
def transform_sequence(input_seq):
    # Create a list of objects in the input sequence
    obj_list = []
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        if input_seq[i]!= 0:
            obj_list.append({
                "start_index": i,
                "end_index": i + 1,
                "size": 1,
                "color": input_seq[i]
            })
    # Perform transformations on the objects
    for obj in obj_list:
        if obj["size"] == 2 and obj["color"] == obj["start_index"] + 1:
            # Move adjacent objects together
            obj["start_index"] += 1
            obj["end_index"] += 1
        elif obj["size"] == 1 and not obj["adjacent"]:
            # Remove isolated objects
            obj_list.remove(obj)
    # Create the output sequence
    output_seq = []
    for obj in obj_list:
        output_seq.extend([obj["color"]] * obj["size"])
    return output_seq

# Test the function with some sample inputs
print(transform_sequence([0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(transform_sequence([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]))
print(transform_sequence([4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]))
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
