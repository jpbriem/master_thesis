The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some logical rules and patterns.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of pixels with values from 0 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are considered to be part of the same object.\n* There are several logical rules and patterns that need to be applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence. These include:\n\t+ Objects can move, change size, or be removed.\n\t+ Pixels can change color based on certain conditions.\n\t+ Noise pixels may be introduced or removed.\n\t+ Arithmetic operations may be performed on objects and pixels.\n\nBased on these rules and patterns, I will now provide the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, test output, and other information requested in the task.\n\nDescription:\nThe input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using logical rules and patterns.\n\nOverall Pattern:\nThe input-output relationship involves applying various logical rules and patterns to the input sequence, including object transformations, noise addition/removal, and arithmetic operations.\n\nInstructions:\nTo transform the input sequence, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on adjacent pixels of the same color.\n2. Apply transformations to objects based on their properties (e.g., move, resize, remove).\n3. Add or remove noise pixels as appropriate.\n4. Perform arithmetic operations on objects and pixels as specified.\n5. Output the resulting transformed sequence.\n\nTransformation:\nThe input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nObject Description:\nThe input sequence contains the following objects:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object_2: {color: 1, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}\n* Object_3: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\nTransformed Objects:\nAfter applying the transformations, the resulting objects in the output sequence are:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object_2: {color: 1, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}\n* Object_3: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\nOutput:\nThe resulting output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTest Output:\nThe test output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
