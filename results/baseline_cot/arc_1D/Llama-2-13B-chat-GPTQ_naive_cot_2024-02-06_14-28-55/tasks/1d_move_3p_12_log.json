The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 8, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence according to some specific pattern.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns observed in the examples:\n\n* Objects: In each example, there are one or more objects (i.e., sequences of adjacent pixels with the same value) that undergo transformations such as moving, resizing, or changing color.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be labeled as noise and are unaffected by the transformations.\n* Arithmetic operations: The transformations often involve arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, or summing the object sizes.\n* Conditional logic: The transformations may be conditioned on certain criteria, such as the distance between objects or their alignment with respect to each other.\n\nBased on these observations, I would suggest that the general pattern for transforming the input sequence into the output sequence involves applying a set of rules to the objects in the input sequence, taking into account their positions, sizes, and colors. These rules may include moving objects to new locations, resizing them, or changing their colors based on certain conditions.\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation for the given test input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObject description:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}\n* Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 4}\n\nTransformed objects:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4} (no change)\n* Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 4} (no change)\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs we can see, the input sequence remains unchanged except for the noise pixels at indices 0 and 9, which are replaced with 8. This suggests that the transformation pattern is simply copying the input sequence without any changes, except for replacing noise pixels with a constant value.\n\nTherefore, the overall pattern for transforming the input sequence into the output sequence is simply copying the input sequence without any modifications.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
