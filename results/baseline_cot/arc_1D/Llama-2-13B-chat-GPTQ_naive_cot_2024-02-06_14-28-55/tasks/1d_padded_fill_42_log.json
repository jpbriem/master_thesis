The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence is a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (one of 0, 4, or 5).\n* The output sequence is also a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color.\n* The transformation rule is as follows:\n\t+ If two adjacent pixels have the same color (i.e., they are part of the same object), then the corresponding output pixel will have the same color as the input pixel.\n\t+ If two adjacent pixels have different colors, then the corresponding output pixel will have the color that is one step clockwise from the color of the input pixel.\n\nFor example, in the first example, the input sequence is `[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Applying the transformation rule, we get the output sequence `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nTo perform the transformation, we need to keep track of the current object being processed (if any) and the current color of the object. We can use a dictionary to store this information, where the keys are the object IDs (starting from 0) and the values are the object colors.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform the transformation:\n```python\ndef transform(input_seq):\n    # Initialize the object dictionary\n    obj_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate over the input sequence\n    for i in range(len(input_seq)):\n        # Get the current pixel color\n        curr_color = input_seq[i]\n\n        # Check if we're starting a new object\n        if i in obj_dict:\n            # End the current object\n            obj_dict[obj_dict['start']]['end'] = i - 1\n            del obj_dict[obj_dict['start']]\n\n        # Start a new object if necessary\n        if curr_color!= obj_dict['start']:\n            obj_dict[curr_color] = {'start': i, 'end': i}\n\n        # Update the current object\n        if curr_color == obj_dict['start']:\n            obj_dict[curr_color]['end'] = i + 1\n\n    # Create the output sequence\n    output_seq = []\n    for key in obj_dict:\n        output_seq.extend(key['start'], key['end'] - key['start'] + 1)\n\n    return np.array(output_seq)\n```\nFinally, here's the JSON description of the task:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"\",\n        \"Overall_Pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\"\n    },\n    \"Instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n    \"Transformation\": {\n        \"Input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n        \"Object_Description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n        \"Transformed_Objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n        \"Output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n    },\n    \"Test_Output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n```"
