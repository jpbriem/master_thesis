            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and removing objects.\n\nFor Example_1, we can see that all objects are moved to the left by 7 positions, so the output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nFor Example_2, we can see that all objects are scaled down by a factor of 4, so the output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0].\n\nFor Example_3, we can see that all objects are removed except for one object at index 5, so the output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer that the general transformation rule is to apply a series of operations to each object in the input sequence, depending on its position and properties. These operations may include movement, scaling, removal, and other arithmetical operations.\n\nTo transform the test input sequence, we need to apply the same operations as in the examples. Here's the description of the transformation steps:\n\n1. Move all objects to the left by 4 positions.\n2. Scale all objects down by a factor of 4.\n3. Remove all objects except for one object at index 5.\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0].\n\nFinally, here's the JSON response:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"All objects moved to the left by 7 positions\",\n\"Example_2\": \"All objects scaled down by a factor of 4\",\n\"Example_3\": \"All objects removed except for one object at index 5\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Apply series of operations to each object in the input sequence\",\n\"instructions\": \"Transform a new input sequence using the same operations as in the examples\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\"\n}"
