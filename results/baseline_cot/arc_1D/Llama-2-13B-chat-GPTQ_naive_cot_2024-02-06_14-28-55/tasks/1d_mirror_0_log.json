The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my understanding of the transformation pattern based on the examples:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a certain number of positions.\n\t+ Resizing: Pixels can change size, either growing or shrinking.\n\t+ Color changes: Pixels can change color, either to a different color or back to the background color (0).\n\t+ Removal: Pixels can be removed entirely.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be replaced with noise pixels (randomly chosen integer value between 0 and 8).\n* Arithmetic operations: Pixel values can be modified using basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n* Conditional logic: Transformations can be conditioned upon specific conditions, such as whether a pixel is part of an object or not.\n\nBased on these patterns, I would suggest the following steps to transform the given input sequence into the corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence. This can be done by iterating over each pixel and checking if it has the same color as the previous pixel. If it does, then we have found an object. We need to keep track of the starting and ending indices of each object, as well as their sizes and colors.\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to objects. Depending on the type of transformation, we need to modify the appropriate properties of the objects. For example, if we want to move an object, we need to shift its starting index by the desired amount. If we want to resize an object, we need to adjust its size accordingly.\n\nStep 3: Handle noise pixels. We need to randomly replace some pixels with noise pixels. We can do this by selecting a random pixel and replacing it with a noise pixel.\n\nStep 4: Perform arithmetic operations. Finally, we need to perform any necessary arithmetic operations on the pixel values. This could include adding or subtracting a constant value, multiplying or dividing by a factor, etc.\n\nWith these steps in mind, let's apply them to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, let's identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (size: 8, color: 1)\nObject 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] (size: 7, color: 1)\n\nNext, we'll apply transformations to the objects:\n\nObject 1: Move 2 positions to the right (starting index: 1, ending index: 3)\nObject 2: Resize to 3 pixels (size: 3)\n\nNow we'll handle noise pixels:\n\nReplace pixel at index 4 with noise pixel (value: 5)\n\nFinally, we'll perform arithmetic operations:\n\nAdd 2 to each pixel value\n\nOutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
