The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence: two blue objects (colors 2 and 8) and one green object (color 0).\n* Transformations:\n\t+ Object 1 (blue): Move 2 positions to the right and resize to twice its original size.\n\t+ Object 2 (blue): Move 2 positions to the left and resize to half its original size.\n\t+ Object 3 (green): Move 1 position to the left and resize to half its original size.\n* Noise pixels: None.\n* Arithmetic operations: None.\n* Conditions: None.\n\nBased on these observations, here's the expected output sequence:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"...\",\n        \"Overall_Pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\"\n    },\n    \"Instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n    \"Transformation\": {\n        \"Input\": \"[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n        \"Object_Description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n        \"Transformed_Objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n        \"Output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n    },\n    \"Test_Output\": \"[2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nIn summary, the input sequence consists of three objects of different colors, and the transformation involves moving and resizing some of the objects while keeping others unchanged. The output sequence reflects these changes, with the objects now arranged differently and having different sizes and positions."
