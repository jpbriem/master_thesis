You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a set of logical rules that involve object transformations, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.

To begin, let's take a closer look at the input and output sequences. The input sequence is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This sequence consists of zeros and fours, with each four representing a object of a specific color (in this case, blue). The objects are separated by zero pixels, which represent the background color (black).

The output sequence is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This sequence consists entirely of zeros, indicating that all objects have been removed and replaced with background color pixels.

Now, let's consider the transformation pattern that relates the input and output sequences. From the examples provided, we can see that the transformation involves several operations, including:

1. Object creation: New objects are created based on existing ones, with the same color and size.
2. Object movement: Objects are moved to new positions, either horizontally or vertically.
3. Object resizing: Objects are resized, either growing or shrinking in size.
4. Object removal: Objects are removed completely, leaving behind background color pixels.
5. Noise addition: Random pixels are added to the output sequence, creating a "noisy" appearance.

Based on these patterns, we can infer that the transformation from input to output is a complex process involving multiple steps. To perform this transformation, we need to carefully analyze each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation operation based on the object's properties.

For the test case input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we can apply the following transformation steps:

1. Object creation: Create a new object at position 0, with color 4 and size 4.
2. Object movement: Move the object at position 4 to position 8.
3. Object resizing: Resize the object at position 8 to double its original size (i.e., from 4 to 8).
4. Object removal: Remove the object at position 2, leaving behind a background color pixel.
5. Noise addition: Add random noise to the output sequence, creating a "noisy" appearance.

After applying these transformation steps, we get the following output sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Therefore, the needed transformation action to transform a new input into its output is to carefully analyze each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation operation based on the object's properties, taking into account the patterns and rules described above.
