            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, resizing, and changing color. Additionally, there are noise pixels that can affect the objects in various ways.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`, here's what I observe:\n\n* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence, each represented by a run of consecutive pixels of the same color. Object 1 has color 0, starts at index 0, and ends at index 3. Object 2 has color 3, starts at index 4, and ends at index 6. Object 3 has color 0, starts at index 7, and ends at index 9.\n* Noise pixels: There are two noise pixels, one at index 3 (color 3) and one at index 8 (color 0).\n\nNow, let me describe the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn the input sequence `[0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we have two objects: Object 1 (colors 0 and 2) and Object 2 (color 2). In the output sequence `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we see that Object 1 has doubled in size and moved to the right, while Object 2 has also moved to the right but kept its original size. The noise pixel at index 0 has been replaced with a pixel of color 2.\n\nExample 2:\nIn the input sequence `[4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we have one object (color 4) that spans indices 0-4. In the output sequence `[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we see that the object has tripled in size and moved to the right.\n\nExample 3:\nIn the input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]`, we have two objects: Object 1 (color 7) that spans indices 0-3, and Object 2 (color 7) that spans indices 4-6. In the output sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]`, we see that both objects have doubled in size and moved to the right.\n\nBased on these observations, I believe the general pattern for the transformation is as follows:\n\n* Objects move to the right and can change size.\n* Noise pixels can appear or disappear, and their color can affect the objects they are next to.\n\nTo transform the input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`, we need to apply the above pattern. Here's the transformed output sequence:\n\n`[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`\n\nAs you can see, no objects were created or destroyed, and the noise pixel at index 3 was replaced with a pixel of color 3.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to perform additional tasks."
