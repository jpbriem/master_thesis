The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects (or pixels) around, changing their size, and sometimes changing their color. The noise pixels also seem to play a role in the transformation.\n\nBased on these observations, here is my understanding of the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects can move horizontally or vertically, and their size can change.\n* Objects can overlap or be contained within other objects.\n* Some objects may change color.\n* Noise pixels can appear or disappear.\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation for the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere's how the transformation was applied:\n\n1. Object #1 (color 2): moved horizontally rightward by 2 positions, so now it starts at index 2 and ends at index 4. Its size increased from 2 to 4.\n2. Object #2 (color 2): moved vertically downward by 2 positions, so now it starts at index 4 and ends at index 6. Its size remained the same (2).\n3. Object #3 (color 0): appeared at index 6 and has size 2.\n4. Noise pixel at index 8 was removed.\n\nOverall, the transformation involved moving objects and changing their size, while also introducing new objects and removing noise pixels.\n\nNow, if we were to provide the actual test input sequence, I could apply the same transformation to produce the corresponding output sequence.\n\nPlease note that the above description is based on my understanding of the patterns observed in the examples provided. If there are any additional or different patterns that need to be considered, please let me know."
