The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining adjacent pixels of the same color into larger objects, while also applying some noise pixels to the output sequence.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of single-pixel objects (represented by the numbers 0-8) separated by gaps of zero pixels. The output sequence combines adjacent pixels of the same color into larger objects, resulting in fewer but larger objects in the output. For instance, the first object in the input sequence (0) becomes a two-pixel object in the output sequence (0, 0). Similarly, the second object (1) becomes a three-pixel object (1, 1, 1), and so on.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the transformation is similar to Example 1, but with a different starting point. Instead of combining adjacent pixels of the same color, the output sequence starts by combining adjacent pixels of different colors. For instance, the first object in the input sequence (0) becomes a two-pixel object in the output sequence (0, 2), and the second object (2) becomes a three-pixel object (2, 2, 2).\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a mix of single-pixel objects and longer objects made up of adjacent pixels of the same color. The output sequence combines these objects in a similar way to Examples 1 and 2, but with some additional noise pixels added to the output. For instance, the first object in the input sequence (0) becomes a two-pixel object in the output sequence (0, 1), and the second object (1) becomes a three-pixel object (1, 1, 1).\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves combining adjacent pixels of the same color into larger objects, while also applying some noise pixels to the output sequence. To perform the transformation, we will need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and determine how it should be combined with neighboring objects to produce the corresponding output object.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case input sequence:\n\nInput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, I notice that the input sequence consists entirely of the number 4, indicating that there are no noise pixels present. Therefore, the output sequence will likely consist of a series of identical objects, each consisting of four pixels.\n\nNext, I observe that the input sequence has a repeating pattern of alternating between two colors: 4 and 8. This suggests that the output sequence may also have a repeating pattern, possibly involving the same two colors.\n\nFinally, I note that the input sequence ends with a gap of zero pixels, followed by the number 8. This suggests that the output sequence may also end with a gap of zero pixels, potentially leading to a shorter output sequence than the input sequence.\n\nWith these observations in mind, here is my proposed transformation for the test case input sequence:\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Combine adjacent pixels of the same color (in this case, 4) into a single object.\n* Repeat this process for each object in the input sequence, resulting in a series of identical objects each consisting of four pixels.\n* End the output sequence with a gap of zero pixels, followed by the number 8.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\nThe input-output relationship for all input-output pairs involves combining adjacent pixels of the same color into larger objects, while also applying some noise pixels to the output sequence. In this specific test case, the input sequence consists entirely of the number 4, indicating that there are no noise pixels present. Therefore, the output sequence will likely consist of a series of identical objects, each consisting of four pixels.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\n2. Mind the sequence length!\n3. Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.\n4. Transform the input sequence into its output sequence using the above transformation pattern.\n5. Create the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\n\nTransformation:\n\nInput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObject Description:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 4}\n* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 4, end_index: 8, size: 4}\n\nTransformed Objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 4}\n* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 4, end_index: 8, size: 4}\n\nOutput: [[4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4]]\n\nNote that the output sequence consists of two identical objects, each consisting of four pixels. The first object corresponds to the first four pixels of the input sequence, while the second object corresponds to the remaining four pixels."
