            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]\noutput: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, changing their size and color, and removing or adding objects.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that some objects (represented by the 8s) are moved to different positions in the output sequence. Specifically, two objects are moved one position to the left, while another object is moved three positions to the right. Additionally, some objects change size (from 8 to 6), and one object changes color (from 8 to 1).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]\nOutput: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nIn this example, we can see that some objects are removed (the 8s), while others are added (the 1s). Additionally, some objects change size (from 8 to 6), and some objects change color (from 8 to 1).\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all objects change size (from 8 to 6), and some objects change color (from 8 to 1). Additionally, one object is added to the beginning of the output sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving objects, changing their size and color, and removing or adding objects.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its output sequence, I would need to apply the transformation pattern described above. Here's my analysis of the input sequence:\n\n* Objects: There are eight objects in the input sequence, each represented by the number 8.\n* Relations between objects: There are no relationships between objects in the input sequence.\n* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n* Arithmetic operations: None are applied to the input sequence.\n* Conditions: None are specified for the input sequence.\n\nBased on the transformation pattern, here's what I would do to transform the input sequence into its output sequence:\n\n1. Move the first object one position to the left (from index 0 to index -1).\n2. Change the second object's size from 8 to 6.\n3. Remove the third object.\n4. Add a new object at index 4 with size 1 and color 1.\n5. Change the fifth object's size from 8 to 6.\n6. Move the seventh object three positions to the right (from index 7 to index 4).\n7. Change the eighth object's size from 8 to 6.\n\nAnd here's the resulting output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
