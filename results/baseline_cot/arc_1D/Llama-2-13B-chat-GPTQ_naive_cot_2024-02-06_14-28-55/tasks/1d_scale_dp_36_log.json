            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there are noise pixels that can affect the output.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color `2` (represented by the consecutive `2`s) and one object of color `7` (represented by the single `7`). The objects are separated by zero-indexed positions represented by `0`.\n* Transformations: To apply the transformation pattern, we need to consider the relationships between the objects and the noise pixels.\n\t+ Distance: The two objects of color `2` are adjacent to each other, while the object of color `7` is not adjacent to any other object.\n\t+ Alignment: The objects are aligned horizontally, meaning they all have the same x-coordinate.\n\t+ Overlap: The two objects of color `2` overlap each other, while the object of color `7` does not overlap any other object.\n\t+ Containment: None of the objects contain any other object.\n* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, the transformation pattern for this input sequence can be described as follows:\n\n* Move the two objects of color `2` towards the right by one position, so that they do not overlap anymore.\n* Scale the object of color `7` up by a factor of 2, so that it covers the entire row.\n* Set all non-object pixels (i.e., the zeros) to the background color `0`.\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence:\n```json\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to analyze another input sequence."
