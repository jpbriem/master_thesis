The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output pairs follow a certain pattern, where the input sequences are composed of zeros and ones representing different pixel colors, and the output sequences are obtained by applying some transformations to the input sequences.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns observed in the examples:\n\n* Objects: The input sequences consist of objects of different sizes and colors. These objects can move, change size, or change color.\n* Noise pixels: There may be noise pixels in the input sequences that do not belong to any object.\n* Arithmetic operations: The output sequences are obtained by applying arithmetic operations to the input sequences, such as counting, sorting, or summing up the objects.\n* Conditional logic: The transformations applied to the input sequences may depend on certain conditions, such as the size or color of the objects.\n\nBased on these observations, here's my proposed transformation pattern for the input-output pairs:\n\n* Input: A sequence of integers representing the pixel colors (0 for background, 1-9 for different object colors).\n* Output: A sequence of integers representing the transformed pixel colors.\n\nTo transform an input sequence, I would apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their size and color.\n2. Apply transformations to each object based on its properties (e.g., move, resize, change color).\n3. Update the output sequence with the transformed objects.\n4. Add noise pixels to the output sequence if necessary.\n5. Apply arithmetic operations to the output sequence as needed (e.g., count, sort, sum).\n6. Conditionally apply additional transformations based on the object properties.\n\nNow, let me apply this pattern to the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence.\n\nObserved objects:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] (size: 4, color: 2)\n* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] (size: 4, color: 2)\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to each object.\n\nObject 1: Move 2 pixels to the right.\nObject 2: Move 2 pixels to the left.\n\nStep 3: Update the output sequence with the transformed objects.\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has been transformed according to the pattern observed in the examples. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll proceed to create the test output sequence based on the given input sequence. Here it is:\n\nTest output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with."
