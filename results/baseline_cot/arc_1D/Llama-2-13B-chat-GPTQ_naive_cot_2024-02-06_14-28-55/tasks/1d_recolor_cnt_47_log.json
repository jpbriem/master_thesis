The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, I can see that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations. Here's my understanding of the pattern:\n\n* Objects in the input sequence are assigned a color (0, 8, or 3) based on their position and the previous object's color.\n* Objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, or changing color. These transformations are determined by the distance between objects, their alignment, and other relationships.\n* Some objects may be removed or copied depending on the specific transformation rule applied.\n* The output sequence reflects these transformations, with each object taking on the appropriate color and size based on the transformation rules.\n\nNow, let me apply this understanding to the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the pattern described above, here's how I would transform the input sequence:\n\n1. Object #1 (position 0): Keep the current color (0).\n2. Object #2 (position 1): Change color to 8 because it has the same color as the previous object (Object #1).\n3. Object #3 (position 2): Remove because it is not aligned with any other object.\n4. Object #4 (position 3): Move to position 4 and change color to 3 because it is now aligned with Object #5.\n5. Object #5 (position 4): Resize to twice the original size and change color to 8 because it is now aligned with Object #6.\n6. Object #6 (position 5): Copy and move to position 7, maintaining the original size and color.\n7. Object #7 (position 6): Remove because it is not aligned with any other object.\n8. Object #8 (position 7): Move to position 8 and change color to 3 because it is now aligned with Object #9.\n9. Object #9 (position 8): Resize to twice the original size and change color to 8 because it is now aligned with Object #10.\n10. Object #10 (position 9): Copy and move to position 10, maintaining the original size and color.\n\nHere's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
