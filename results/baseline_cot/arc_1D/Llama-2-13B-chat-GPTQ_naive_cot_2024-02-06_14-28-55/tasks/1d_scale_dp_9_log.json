The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a specific pattern of object transformations.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of pixels with values from 0 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color (background color is 0).\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example, [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with two objects: Object_1 with color 2 and size 2, and Object_2 with color 3 and size 1.\n* The transformation from input to output follows a specific pattern involving object transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, and changing color.\n* The output sequence will also consist of pixels with values from 0 to 9, but the values will represent the transformed objects.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the differences between the input and output sequences for Example_1:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6]\n\nIn this example, all objects remain the same size and position, but their color has been changed. Specifically, all objects with color 4 have been replaced with objects of color 6.\n\nNow, let me describe the overall pattern for all input-output pairs:\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n* All objects remain the same size and position.\n* Some objects change color, while others retain their original color.\n* No new objects are introduced or removed.\n\nInstructions:\n\n* Transform the input sequence into the output sequence using the specified pattern.\n* Focus on the size, position, and color of the objects in both sequences.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6]\n\nBased on the pattern observed in the examples, the transformation involves replacing some objects with different colors. In this case, all objects with color 4 are replaced with objects of color 6.\n\nNow, let me create the test output sequence:\n\nTest Output: np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6])\n\nFinally, here's the complete description of the task:\n\nDescription:\n\n* Input sequence consisting of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.\n* Transformation from input to output follows a specific pattern involving object transformations.\n* Output sequence will also consist of pixels with values from 0 to 9, but the values will represent the transformed objects.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
