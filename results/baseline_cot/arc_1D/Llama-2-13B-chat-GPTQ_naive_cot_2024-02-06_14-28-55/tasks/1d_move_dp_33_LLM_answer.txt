[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:

* Moving objects (represented by non-zero values) to adjacent positions
* Scaling objects by a factor of 2 or 3
* Removing objects if their size is less than a certain threshold (represented by zero values)
* Copying objects to create duplicates
* Changing the color of objects

Based on these observations, here is my understanding of the transformation pattern:

* Objects are moved to adjacent positions if they have a non-zero value. This means that any object with a value greater than zero will be shifted to the next position in the sequence.
* Objects are scaled by a factor of 2 or 3. If an object has a value of 2, it will be doubled in size to become two objects with values of 1 each. Similarly, if an object has a value of 3, it will be tripled in size to become three objects with values of 1 each.
* Objects are removed if their size is less than a certain threshold (represented by zero values). Any object with a value of zero will be removed from the sequence.
* Objects can be copied to create duplicates. If an object has a value greater than zero, it may be duplicated one or more times in the sequence.
* Objects can change color. Some objects may change color from one value to another. For example, an object with a value of 2 may change to a value of 3.

With this understanding of the transformation pattern, let me now apply it to the given test case:

Input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. Based on the patterns observed so far, we know that objects are represented by non-zero values. In this case, we have the following objects:

* Object 1: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, let's apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence:

1. Move objects to adjacent positions:
	* Object 1: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] becomes [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
	* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] remains unchanged
2. Scale objects by a factor of 2 or 3:
	* Object 1: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] becomes [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
	* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] remains unchanged
3. Remove objects if their size is less than a certain threshold (represented by zero values):
	* Object 1: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] becomes [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
	* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] remains unchanged
4. Copy objects to create duplicates:
	* Object 1: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] becomes [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
5. Change the color of objects:
	* Object 1: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] becomes [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

And finally, here is the transformed output sequence:

Output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
