The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd now, let me describe the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject_1: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject_2: {color: 5, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\nObject_3: {color: 5, start_index: 8, end_index: 10, size: 2}\n\nNow, let me explain the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects can move horizontally (left or right) by a fixed amount.\n* Objects can change size by a factor of 2 or 3.\n* Pixels can become noise pixels (value 0).\n* Arithmetic operations may occur between objects, such as addition or subtraction.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can deduce the following transformation rules:\n\n1. Object_1 moves left by 2 positions.\n2. Object_2 changes size from 5 to 3.\n3. Object_3 moves right by 2 positions.\n4. All pixels with value 5 become noise pixels (value 0).\n\nNow, let me apply these rules to the input sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has undergone several transformations compared to the input sequence. Objects have moved, changed size, and some pixels have become noise pixels.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the transformation pattern and how to apply it to new input sequences! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
