            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a set of logical rules that involve object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations based on objects.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis input sequence consists of 16 pixels, each with a value of either 0 or 3. There are several groups of adjacent pixels with the same color (3), indicating objects in the scene.\n\nNow, let me describe the desired output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has undergone some changes compared to the input sequence. In particular, there are several instances where objects have been moved, resized, or had their color modified. Additionally, there are some noise pixels scattered throughout the sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving them, scaling them, or changing their color. The exact nature of these operations will depend on the specific rules defined for each example.\n\nTo complete the task, you will need to define the necessary transformation actions to convert the input sequence into the output sequence. This may involve using logic to determine which operations to apply to each object based on its properties and the context in which it appears.\n\nHere is the required information in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, being precise about what changed and how!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, thinking step by step.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps you get started on completing the task! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
