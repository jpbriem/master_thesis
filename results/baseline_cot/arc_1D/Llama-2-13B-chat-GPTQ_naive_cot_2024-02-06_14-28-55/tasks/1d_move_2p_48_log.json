The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 7, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence according to some specific pattern.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns observed in the examples:\n\n* Objects: In each example, there are one or more objects (i.e., sequences of adjacent pixels with the same value) that need to be transformed. The objects can move, change size, or change color.\n* Noise pixels: There may be noise pixels in the input sequence that do not belong to any object. These pixels should be removed.\n* Arithmetic operations: The transformation involves arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, and summing up the object sizes.\n* Conditional logic: The transformation is conditioned upon certain rules, such as whether two objects overlap or not.\n\nBased on these observations, here's the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences:\n\nFor each object in the input sequence, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Move the object to a new location based on certain rules (e.g., moving an object to the left if it overlaps with another object).\n2. Change the size of the object based on certain rules (e.g., doubling the size of an object if it is fully contained within another object).\n3. Change the color of the object based on certain rules (e.g., changing the color of an object to the average color of all objects it overlaps with).\n4. Remove any noise pixels that do not belong to any object.\n5. Perform arithmetical operations on the objects, such as counting their sizes and sorting them based on their sizes.\n6. Apply conditional logic to determine the final placement of the objects in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let me provide the actual transformation for the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Object 1 (values 0, 0, 0, 0, 0):\n\t* Move to the left because it overlaps with object 2.\n\t* Size increases to 4 because it is fully contained within object 2.\n\t* Color changes to 7 because it is the average color of all objects it overlaps with.\n2. Object 2 (values 7, 7, 7, 7, 7):\n\t* Remains at the same location because it does not overlap with any other object.\n\t* Size remains unchanged.\n\t* Color remains unchanged.\n3. Noise pixels (value 0):\n\t* Remove because they do not belong to any object.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to explain anything else."
