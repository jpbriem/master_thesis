[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing the color of objects. Here's my analysis of the three examples:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence of length 16, consisting of seven copies of the color 7. The output sequence has the same length, but with some changes to the objects. Specifically, each object of color 7 has been moved one position to the right, so that there are now eight objects of color 7, each shifted one position to the right. Additionally, the last two objects (positions 14 and 15) have been replaced with objects of color 0.

Example 2:
In this example, we have an input sequence of length 12, consisting of six copies of the color 3. The output sequence has the same length, but with some changes to the objects. Specifically, each object of color 3 has been scaled up by a factor of three, so that there are now six larger objects of color 3, each covering three positions in the output sequence.

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence of length 18, consisting of four copies of the color 0, followed by four copies of the color 4. The output sequence has the same length, but with some changes to the objects. Specifically, each object of color 0 has been replaced with an object of color 4, so that there are now four objects of color 4 in the output sequence.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as movement, scaling, and replacement. The specific operations applied seem to depend on the colors present in the input sequence, and may involve conditions or constraints that affect the application of these operations.

Now, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:

input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, here's my analysis of the test case:

The input sequence consists of ten zeros and five ones, indicating that there are five objects of color 5 in the input sequence. Applying the transformation pattern observed in the examples, we can expect that these objects will undergo some kind of operation, possibly involving movement, scaling, or replacement.

To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the appropriate operations to each object in the input sequence. Since the input sequence consists of five objects of color 5, we can expect that each object will undergo a different operation, depending on the specific conditions or constraints involved.

Here's my proposed transformation for the test case:

* Object 1 (position 0): Move one position to the right, so that it becomes object 2 in the output sequence.
* Object 2 (position 1): Scale up by a factor of three, so that it covers three positions in the output sequence (positions 1-3).
* Object 3 (position 2): Replace with an object of color 0, so that there is no object at position 2 in the output sequence.
* Object 4 (position 3): Move one position to the left, so that it becomes object 1 in the output sequence.
* Object 5 (position 4): Scale down by a factor of three, so that it becomes a single object of color 5 at position 4 in the output sequence.

With these transformations applied, we obtain the following output sequence:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you.
