The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing different pixel colors, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence according to some specific pattern.\n\nFrom the examples given, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n* Each object (i.e., sequence of adjacent pixels of the same color) has a fixed size, which is determined by the number of pixels of that color in the input sequence.\n* Objects can move horizontally, change color, or disappear completely.\n* There is no noise in the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, here is my inference of the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences:\n\nThe input sequence is transformed into the output sequence by applying a series of operations to each object in the input sequence, including moving, resizing, changing color, and removing objects. These operations are applied in a specific order, depending on the type of object and its properties.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, thinking step by step:\n\nStep 1: Identify all objects in the input sequence.\n\nStep 2: Move any object that overlaps with another object to a new location, ensuring that there is no overlap.\n\nStep 3: Resize any object that is too large or too small to fit within the boundaries of the image.\n\nStep 4: Change the color of any object that needs to be updated.\n\nStep 5: Remove any object that is no longer needed or is outside the boundaries of the image.\n\nWith these steps, we can create the resulting test output sequence. Here is the description of the overall pattern and the instructions for each step:\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n* Objects move, resize, change color, and disappear.\n* No noise is introduced during the transformation process.\n\nInstructions:\n\nStep 1: Identify all objects in the input sequence.\n\n* Look for sequences of adjacent pixels of the same color.\n* Record the starting and ending indices of each object.\n\nStep 2: Move any object that overlaps with another object to a new location, ensuring that there is no overlap.\n\n* Check for overlapping objects and move them to non-overlapping locations.\n* Keep track of the new positions and sizes of the objects.\n\nStep 3: Resize any object that is too large or too small to fit within the boundaries of the image.\n\n* Measure the size of each object and adjust it accordingly.\n* Ensure that the object does not go outside the boundaries of the image.\n\nStep 4: Change the color of any object that needs to be updated.\n\n* Check for objects that need their color updated and update them accordingly.\n\nStep 5: Remove any object that is no longer needed or is outside the boundaries of the image.\n\n* Check for objects that are no longer needed or are outside the boundaries of the image and remove them.\n\nWith these steps, we can create the test output sequence. Here is the code to implement these steps in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_sequence(sequence):\n    # Step 1: Identify all objects in the input sequence.\n    objects = []\n    for i in range(len(sequence)):\n        if sequence[i]!= 0:\n            objects.append([i, i + 1])\n    \n    # Step 2: Move any object that overlaps with another object to a new location, ensuring that there is no overlap.\n    for obj in objects:\n        for other_obj in objects:\n            if obj[1] > other_obj[0] and obj[0] < other_obj[1]:\n                # Overlap detected! Move one of the objects to a new location.\n                if obj[0] < other_obj[0]:\n                    obj[0] += other_obj[0] - obj[0]\n                    other_obj[0] -= obj[0] - other_obj[0]\n                else:\n                    obj[1] += other_obj[1] - obj[1]\n                    other_obj[1] -= obj[1] - other_obj[1]\n        \n    # Step 3: Resize any object that is too large or too small to fit within the boundaries of the image.\n    for obj in objects:\n        if obj[1] - obj[0] > 2:\n            obj[0] = 0\n            obj[1] = 2\n        elif obj[1] - obj[0] < -2:\n            obj[0] = 8\n            obj[1] = 6\n        \n    # Step 4: Change the color of any object that needs to be updated.\n    for obj in objects:\n        if obj[0] == 7:\n            obj[0] = 0\n        \n    # Step 5: Remove any object that is no longer needed or is outside the boundaries of the image.\n    for obj in objects:\n        if obj[0] < 0 or obj[1] >= len(sequence):\n            del objects[objects.index(obj)]\n    \n    return objects\n\n# Test input sequence\ninput_sequence = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Transform the input sequence\ntransformed_sequence = transform_sequence(input_sequence)\n\n# Print the transformed sequence\nprint(transformed_sequence)\n```\nAnd here is the expected output for the test input sequence:\n```json\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!
