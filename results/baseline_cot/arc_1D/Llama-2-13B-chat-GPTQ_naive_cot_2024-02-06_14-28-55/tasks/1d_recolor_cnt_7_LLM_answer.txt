You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing their color. Additionally, there are some noise pixels that need to be taken into account.

To begin, let's take a closer look at the input sequence you provided:

`input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9]`

Based on the patterns we've seen so far, here's what I can observe about the objects in this input sequence:

* There are three objects in total: two blue objects (represented by the value 9) and one red object (represented by the value 0).
* Each object has a size of 2 pixels, except for the last red object, which has a size of 1 pixel.
* All objects are located at the beginning of the sequence, with the first blue object starting at index 0 and the second blue object starting at index 2.

Now, let's consider the desired output sequence. Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output sequence should consist of the original objects, but possibly moved, resized, or modified in some way. Here's my interpretation of the output sequence for the given input sequence:

`output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 0]`

Here's how I arrived at this output sequence:

* The first blue object (value 9) remains unchanged and is located at index 0.
* The second blue object (value 9) moves one position to the right and is now located at index 2.
* The red object (value 0) disappears and is replaced by a new object with value 4, which is located at index 4.
* The remaining noise pixels (values 0) are set to the value 1.

Therefore, the transformation from the input sequence to the output sequence involves moving one blue object to the right, replacing one red object with a new object, and setting the remaining noise pixels to the value 1.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to explain anything else.
