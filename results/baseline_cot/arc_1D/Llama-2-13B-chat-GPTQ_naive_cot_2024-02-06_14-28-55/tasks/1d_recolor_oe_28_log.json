            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there may be conditions attached to these operations that determine whether they are applied or not.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7]`, here's my analysis of the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: `color = 7` and `size = 7` (a single object spanning positions 0-6)\n* Object 2: `color = 7` and `size = 1` (seven separate objects at positions 7-13)\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, we can make the following assumptions about the transformation:\n\n* Objects can move horizontally (i.e., change their position relative to each other).\n* Objects can change size (either growing or shrinking).\n* Objects can change color.\n\nNow, let's apply these assumptions to the input sequence. Here's what the transformed output sequence might look like:\n\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]`\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes made to each object in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: moved horizontally to positions 0-6, maintaining its original size and color.\n* Object 2: moved horizontally to positions 7-13, grew in size to 5, and changed color to 3.\n\nNote that the output sequence still has a total length of 14, matching the input sequence. Also, the noise pixels (represented by zeros) were preserved in the output sequence.\n\nTo summarize, the key steps involved in transforming the input sequence were:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color and size.\n2. Apply assumptions about object behavior (movement, resizing, color changes) to transform the objects.\n3. Preserve noise pixels and ensure the output sequence has the correct length.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
