You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. Additionally, there are conditions attached to these operations that determine whether they should be applied or not.

To describe the transformation pattern in JSON format, we can start by defining the object description for the input sequence:

{
"description": {
"Object_1": {"size": 2, "position": [1, 2], "color": 3},
"Object_2": {"size": 1, "position": [4, 5], "color": 2}
}
}

Next, we can describe the overall pattern for transforming objects in the input sequence:

{
"overall_pattern": "move Object_1 by (1, 1) if its color is 3, and scale Object_2 by 2 if its color is 2."
}

Now, let's apply this pattern to the given input sequence:

[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. Based on the object descriptions provided, we can see that there are two objects: Object_1 and Object_2.

Object_1 has a size of 2 and is located at positions [1, 2] with a color of 3.

Object_2 has a size of 1 and is located at positions [4, 5] with a color of 2.

Next, we need to apply the transformation operations to each object based on its properties. In this case, we need to move Object_1 by (1, 1) if its color is 3, and scale Object_2 by 2 if its color is 2.

After applying these operations, we get the following output sequence:

[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Here's the breakdown of the transformation operations applied to each object:

* Object_1: moved by (1, 1) since its color is 3, so its new location is [2, 3].
* Object_2: scaled by 2 since its color is 2, so its new size is 2 x 2 = 4.

Therefore, the final output sequence is [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain anything else.
