            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects (represented by non-zero values) around and resizing them, while keeping their relative positions and colors unchanged. Additionally, there are some noise pixels (represented by zero values) that appear to be randomly distributed throughout the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, here is my understanding of the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Objects can move left, right, up, or down by a fixed amount (e.g., 1 pixel).\n\t+ Resizing: Objects can change size, either growing or shrinking by a fixed amount (e.g., 2 pixels).\n\t+ Alignment: Objects can align themselves with each other horizontally or vertically.\n* Noise pixels:\n\t+ Random placement: Noise pixels can appear anywhere in the input sequence, regardless of object boundaries.\n\t+ Random value assignment: Each noise pixel has a random value assigned to it, drawn from a predefined set of values (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0, 3]).\n\nNow, let me apply this understanding to the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, let's identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nObject 2: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNext, we need to determine the desired output sequence based on the transformation pattern. Here's what I believe the output sequence should look like:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Object 1 moves 2 pixels to the right, so its starting index becomes 1 instead of 0.\n* Object 2 grows by 2 pixels in both dimensions, so its size becomes 4 pixels wide and tall.\n* Since there are no noise pixels in the input sequence, none are added to the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final output sequence should be [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
