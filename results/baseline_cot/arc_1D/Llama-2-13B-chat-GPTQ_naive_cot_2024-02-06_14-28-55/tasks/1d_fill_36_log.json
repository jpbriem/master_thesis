The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, and copying objects, as well as changing their color.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what the transformation would look like:\n\n1. Object #1 (color 2) has size 2 and starts at index 1, so it needs to be moved to the beginning of the sequence.\n2. Object #2 (color 0) has size 1 and starts at index 3, so it needs to be removed.\n3. Object #3 (color 2) has size 2 and starts at index 5, so it needs to be scaled down to size 1 and moved to the end of the sequence.\n4. Object #4 (color 0) has size 1 and starts at index 7, so it needs to be copied and pasted after object #3.\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence: `[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nIn JSON format, the description of the transformation would look like this:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"All objects were moved to the beginning of the sequence.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"All objects were scaled up to twice their original size.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"Object #3 was moved to the end of the sequence.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Objects were moved, scaled, or removed based on their properties.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Transform the input sequence by applying the described operations to each object based on its properties.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n        \"object_description\": \"List of objects in the input sequence, including their color, size, and starting index.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"List of objects in the transformed output sequence, including their color, size, and starting index.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```"
