You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.

Here's my understanding of the transformation pattern based on the examples:

* Objects:
	+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 4, 0]).
	+ Resizing: Pixels can change size (e.g., [3, 3, 3, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9, 3]).
	+ Color changes: Pixels can change color (e.g., [7, 7, 7, 7] becomes [1, 1, 1, 1]).
	+ Overlapping: Pixels can overlap each other (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 3]).
* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be replaced with noise pixels (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 8]).
* Arithmetic operations: Pixels can be subject to arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, etc. (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]).
* Conditional transformations: Transformations can be conditioned on certain criteria (e.g., if a pixel is blue, change its color to red).

Based on these patterns, I would infer that the goal of the task is to transform an input sequence of pixel colors into an output sequence of pixel colors using the given transformation pattern.

Now, let me apply this understanding to the test case you provided:

Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

First, I will identify the objects in the input sequence:

* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 7, size: 7}
* Object 2: {color: 1, start_index: 8, end_index: 10, size: 3}
* Object 3: {color: 2, start_index: 11, end_index: 13, size: 2}

Now, I will apply the transformation pattern to each object:

Object 1:

* Move: No movement.
* Resize: No resizing.
* Color change: None.
* Overlap: None.

Object 2:

* Move: Move right by 3 positions (from index 8 to index 11).
* Resize: Double in size (from size 1 to size 2).
* Color change: Change color from 1 to 2.
* Overlap: Overlap with Object 3.

Object 3:

* Move: Move left by 2 positions (from index 11 to index 9).
* Resize: Halve in size (from size 2 to size 1).
* Color change: Change color from 2 to 7.
* Overlap: Overlap with Object 1.

After applying the transformations, we get the following output sequence:

Output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, the output sequence has undergone the desired transformations based on the given pattern.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do for you.
