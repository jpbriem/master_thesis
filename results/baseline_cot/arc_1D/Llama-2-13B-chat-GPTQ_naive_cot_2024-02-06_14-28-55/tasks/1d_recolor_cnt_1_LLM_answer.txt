You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.

To begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, let me analyze the patterns in the input sequence:

* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color. These objects include:
	+ Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 5] (color: 5)
	+ Object 2: [5, 0, 0, 5] (color: 5)
	+ Object 3: [0, 5, 0, 5] (color: 5)
	+ Object 4: [5, 5, 0, 5] (color: 5)
* Noise pixels: There are several noise pixels scattered throughout the input sequence, represented by the value 0.
* Arithmetical operations: There are several arithmetical operations performed on the objects in the input sequence, including addition and multiplication.

Based on these observations, I can infer that the goal of the transformation is to produce an output sequence that reflects the original input sequence, but with certain changes applied to the objects and noise pixels.

To achieve this, I would suggest the following steps to transform the input sequence:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their properties, such as size, position, and color.

Step 2: Apply transformations to the objects based on their properties, such as moving them, resizing them, or changing their color.

Step 3: Update the noise pixels based on the transformations applied to the objects.

Step 4: Repeat steps 2-3 until the desired output sequence is achieved.

Using this approach, we can generate the output sequence for the given input sequence. Here's the output sequence for the test case input sequence you provided:

Output: [0, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
