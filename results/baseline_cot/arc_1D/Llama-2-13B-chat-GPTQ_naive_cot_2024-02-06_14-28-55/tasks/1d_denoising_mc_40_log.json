The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence is a list of integers representing pixel colors, where each integer value corresponds to a specific color (0 for background, 1-9 for different object colors).\n* Each object in the input sequence is represented by a contiguous sequence of identical color pixels.\n* The output sequence is also a list of integers representing pixel colors, but with some modifications based on the object properties.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here's the transformation pattern I observe:\n\n* Objects are moved, resized, or removed based on their properties (e.g., distance, alignment, overlap, containment).\n* Pixel values are modified based on the object properties, such as changing the color of an object or removing background pixels.\n\nTo perform the transformation, we need to understand the object properties and the desired outcome. Here's my proposed approach:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and size.\n2. Analyze the object properties, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment, to determine the appropriate transformation.\n3. Apply the transformation to the objects, taking into account their properties and the desired outcome.\n4. Output the resulting transformed output sequence.\n\nHere's the JSON response for the given test case:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"No changes were made to the input sequence.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"Objects were moved and resized based on their properties.\",\n\"Example_3\": \"Objects were moved, resized, and removed based on their properties.\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Transform objects based on their properties, including distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Analyze the object properties and apply the appropriate transformation based on the desired outcome.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Identify objects based on their color and size.\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Move, resize, and modify objects based on their properties.\",\n\"output\": \"[9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n\nPlease let me know if this meets your requirements or if there's anything else you'd like me to do!"
