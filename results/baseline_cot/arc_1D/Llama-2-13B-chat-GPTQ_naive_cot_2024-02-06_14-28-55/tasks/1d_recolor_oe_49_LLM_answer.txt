You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:

* Each object in the input sequence has a specific color (0, 6, or 9) and a specific size (2 or 3).
* Objects of the same color are always touching each other, either horizontally or vertically.
* If two objects of the same color are touching, they merge into a single object with double the size.
* If an object is surrounded by objects of the same color, it changes color to match the surrounding objects.
* Any noise pixels (value 0) in the input sequence are removed.

Based on these rules, we can deduce the following transformation pattern:

* Move objects of the same color together, merging them if possible.
* Remove any noise pixels.
* Change the color of any object that is surrounded by objects of the same color.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the given test input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. We can see that there are several runs of consecutive objects with the same color. Here's the list of objects in the input sequence:

* Object 1: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] (color: 0)
* Object 2: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] (color: 6)
* Object 3: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] (color: 6)

Next, we need to apply the transformation rules to each object. We'll start with Object 1:

* Since Object 1 is surrounded by objects of the same color (colors 0 and 6), it changes color to match the surrounding objects (color 6).
* Since Object 1 is already the maximum size (2), it does not need to move or merge with any other objects.

Now let's move on to Object 2:

* Since Object 2 is surrounded by objects of the same color (colors 6 and 6), it changes color to match the surrounding objects (color 6).
* Since Object 2 is already the maximum size (2), it does not need to move or merge with any other objects.

We can repeat this process for all objects in the input sequence. Here's the updated list of objects after applying the transformation rules:

* Object 1: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] (color: 6)
* Object 2: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] (color: 6)
* Object 3: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] (color: 6)

Finally, we need to convert the list of objects back into a numerical array. Here's the resulting test output sequence:

Output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain anything else.
