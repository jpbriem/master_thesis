[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 3, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some sort of logical rules.

Here's my analysis of the input and output sequences:

Input Sequence:

* The input sequence consists of 15 pixels, each with a value from 0 to 3.
* There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color 3 (pixels [3, 3]) and one object of color 0 (pixel [0]).
* The objects are non-overlapping and have distinct boundaries.

Output Sequence:

* The output sequence also consists of 15 pixels, each with a value from 0 to 3.
* The objects in the input sequence have been transformed in some way to produce the output sequence.

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color. The exact rules for these operations are not explicitly stated, but we can infer some patterns based on the examples:

* Objects of the same color are treated similarly. For example, all objects of color 3 are moved together, and all objects of color 0 are moved together.
* Objects can be resized or shrunk. For example, the object of color 3 at pixel [3, 3] is resized to twice its original size.
* Objects can change color. For example, the object of color 0 at pixel [0] changes color to 3.

With these observations in mind, let's consider the given test case:

Input: [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

After analyzing the input sequence, here's what I believe the output sequence should be based on the patterns observed in the examples:

Output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

In particular, I believe the following operations should be applied to the input sequence:

1. Move all objects of color 3 together.
2. Resize the object of color 3 at pixel [3, 3] to twice its original size.
3. Change the color of the object of color 0 at pixel [0] to 3.
4. Remove any noise pixels (pixels with a value of 0).

Therefore, the output sequence should be:

[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
