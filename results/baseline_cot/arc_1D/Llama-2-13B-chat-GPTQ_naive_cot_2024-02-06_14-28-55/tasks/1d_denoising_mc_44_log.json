The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my understanding of the transformation pattern based on the examples:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 4, 0]).\n\t+ Resizing: Pixels can change size (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 4, 0]).\n\t+ Color changes: Pixels can change color (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 6, 6, 0]).\n\t+ Overlapping: Pixels can overlap each other (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 4, 2]).\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be replaced with noise pixels (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 4, 2, 0]).\n* Arithmetic operations: Pixels can be counted, sorted, or subjected to other arithmetic operations (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [2, 2, 2, 0]).\n* Conditional transformations: Transformations may be conditioned on certain criteria (e.g., if a pixel is blue, change its color to red).\n\nBased on these patterns, I would infer that the goal of the transformation is to produce an output sequence that differs from the input sequence in terms of object size, position, and color. The exact nature of the transformation will depend on the specific test case.\n\nFor the given test case input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I would do to transform it into the corresponding output sequence:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence:\n\t* Object 1: `7` (color)\n\t* Object 2: `6` (color)\n\t* Object 3: `9` (color)\n2. Apply transformations to objects:\n\t* Object 1: Move 2 positions right (`7` becomes `9`)\n\t* Object 2: Resize to twice the original size (`6` becomes `12`)\n\t* Object 3: Change color to `7`\n3. Update the output sequence:\n\t* Output sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 12, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nNote that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid transformations depending on the specific requirements of the task."
