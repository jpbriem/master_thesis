The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, where adjacent pixels of the same color are considered to be part of the same object. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some sort of logical rules and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and a single non-zero value (5) repeated multiple times. The output sequence simply removes all the zeros and replaces them with the value 9. This suggests that the transformation involves copying the non-zero value and pasting it multiple times to create a longer sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and a single non-zero value (4) repeated multiple times. The output sequence simply removes all the zeros and replaces them with the value 9. Like Example 1, this transformation involves copying the non-zero value and pasting it multiple times to create a longer sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a mix of zeros and ones, with the ones indicating the presence of objects. The output sequence appears to simply reverse the order of the objects, so that objects that were previously next to each other are now separated by zeros.\n\nBased on these examples, it seems that the transformation involves applying some sort of logical rule to the input sequence, possibly involving the concept of objects and their relationships (such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment). The exact nature of the transformation remains unclear, however.\n\nAs for the test case input sequence provided, here's my analysis:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis input sequence consists of a series of zeros and twos, with the twos indicating the presence of objects. There are several consecutive runs of twos, which suggests that there may be multiple objects present in the sequence.\n\nTo perform the transformation, we need to apply some sort of logical rule to the input sequence. One possibility is to consider the objects in the sequence and their relationships to each other. For example, we could count the number of objects present in the sequence and use that information to determine how to transform the output. Alternatively, we could use arithmetical operations to manipulate the objects in the sequence, such as adding or subtracting objects based on their positions and sizes.\n\nUltimately, the specific transformation that needs to be applied will depend on the details of the task and the desired outcome. However, based on the examples provided, it seems likely that the transformation will involve logical rules and arithmetical operations related to the objects in the input sequence."
