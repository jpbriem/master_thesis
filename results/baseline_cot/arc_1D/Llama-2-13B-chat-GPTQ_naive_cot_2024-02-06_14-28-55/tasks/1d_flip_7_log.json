The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving objects and their properties. Here's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 9, representing different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.\n* The output sequence will also consist of integers from 0 to 9, but with some modifications based on the objects in the input sequence.\n* There are three examples given, each with a different input and output sequence.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the objects in the input sequence for Example 1:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n\nThese objects are represented by the consecutive pixels of the same color in the input sequence. Now, let me describe the transformation pattern for this example:\n\n* Objects move horizontally by a fixed amount (in this case, 2 pixels).\n* Objects change color if they overlap with another object.\n* Non-overlapping objects remain unchanged.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can deduce the following steps to transform the input sequence into the output sequence for Example 1:\n\n1. Move Object 1 to the right by 2 pixels.\n2. Change the color of Object 2 to 2, since it overlaps with Object 1.\n3. Leave non-overlapping pixels unchanged.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence for Example 1:\n\noutput = [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, let me describe the objects in the input sequence for Example 2:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 1, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, size: 1}\n* Object 2: {color: 1, start_index: 2, end_index: 2, size: 1}\n\nAgain, these objects are represented by the consecutive pixels of the same color in the input sequence. The transformation pattern for this example is similar to Example 1, but with one additional rule:\n\n* Objects move vertically by a fixed amount (in this case, 1 pixel) if they do not overlap with any other object.\n\nWith these patterns in mind, here are the steps to transform the input sequence into the output sequence for Example 2:\n\n1. Move Object 1 down by 1 pixel.\n2. Move Object 2 up by 1 pixel.\n3. Change the color of Object 1 to 1, since it now overlaps with Object 2.\n4. Leave non-overlapping pixels unchanged.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence for Example 2:\n\noutput = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFinally, let me describe the objects in the input sequence for Example 3:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 8, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, size: 1}\n\nIn this example, there is only one object, and it moves horizontally by a fixed amount (in this case, 1 pixel):\n\n* Move Object 1 to the right by 1 pixel.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence for Example 3:\n\noutput = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with the remaining tasks."
