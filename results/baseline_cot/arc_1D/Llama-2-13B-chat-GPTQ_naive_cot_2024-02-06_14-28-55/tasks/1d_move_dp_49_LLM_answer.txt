You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.

From the examples, we can see that the transformations involve moving objects (i.e., pixels with the same color), resizing objects, and changing the color of objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels added to the output sequence.

To solve this task, we need to understand the rules governing these transformations and apply them to the given input sequence. Here's my analysis of the input and output sequences:

Input Sequence:

* The input sequence consists of 16 pixels, each represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 8.
* There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.
* The pixels are organized into four objects: two objects of size 2x2 pixels each, and two objects of size 1x1 pixel each.

Output Sequence:

* The output sequence consists of 16 pixels, each represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 8.
* There are noise pixels added to the output sequence.
* The output sequence has the same object structure as the input sequence, but with some transformations applied:
	+ Object 1 (size 2x2): moved one pixel to the right and down, keeping its original color (2).
	+ Object 2 (size 2x2): moved one pixel to the left and up, and its color was changed to 3.
	+ Object 3 (size 1x1): moved one pixel to the right and up, keeping its original color (2).
	+ Object 4 (size 1x1): moved one pixel to the left and up, and its color was changed to 3.

Based on the above analysis, here's the transformation that needs to be applied to the input sequence to produce the output sequence:

1. Move object 1 one pixel to the right and down.
2. Change the color of object 2 to 3.
3. Move object 3 one pixel to the right and up.
4. Move object 4 one pixel to the left and up.
5. Add noise pixels to the output sequence.

Here's the Python code to implement the transformation:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the input and output sequences
input_seq = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8])
output_seq = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8])

# Apply the transformation
def transform(seq):
    # Move object 1 one pixel to the right and down
    seq[1] = seq[1] + 1
    seq[2] = seq[2] + 1
    
    # Change the color of object 2 to 3
    seq[3] = 3
    
    # Move object 3 one pixel to the right and up
    seq[4] = seq[4] + 1
    
    # Move object 4 one pixel to the left and up
    seq[5] = seq[5] - 1
    
    # Add noise pixels
    noise = np.random.randint(0, 8, size=len(seq))
    seq += noise
    
    return seq

# Apply the transformation to the input sequence
output_seq = transform(input_seq)

print("Input sequence:")
print(input_seq)
print("Output sequence:")
print(output_seq)
```
In this code, we define the input and output sequences as NumPy arrays, and then define a `transform` function that applies the transformations listed above. We then apply the `transform` function to the input sequence and print the result as both an input and output sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
