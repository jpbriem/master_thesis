The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions attached to these operations that determine when they should be applied.\n\nTo describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs, we can identify some common patterns:\n\n* Objects can move horizontally or vertically, or both.\n* Objects can change size, either growing or shrinking.\n* Objects can change color.\n* Objects can be removed or copied.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences. In general, the output sequence will consist of objects that have undergone various transformations based on the conditions specified.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the given test input sequence:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. We can see that there are several runs of consecutive pixels of the same color, indicating objects of different sizes. Here's the description of the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject_2: {color: 2, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}\nObject_3: {color: 2, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 1}\nObject_4: {color: 2, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 2}\n\nNext, we need to determine the transformations that each object should undergo to produce the corresponding output sequence. Based on the patterns we observed earlier, here are the transformations we can apply:\n\nObject_1: Move (2, 0) to the right and down.\nObject_2: Scale (2, 2) and move (4, 2) to the left and up.\nObject_3: Remove.\nObject_4: Copy (2, 2) and move (6, 2) to the right and down.\n\nWith these transformations applied, we can create the test output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn summary, the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs involves applying transformations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties, such as size, position, and color. These transformations can include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. By identifying the objects in the input sequence and determining the appropriate transformations for each object, we can generate the corresponding output sequence."
