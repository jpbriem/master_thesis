The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving objects and their properties. Here's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 8, representing different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example, [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with two objects: Object_1 (colors 2 and 3) and Object_2 (color 2).\n* The output sequence is obtained by applying a set of transformations to the input sequence, including moves, resizes, rotations, and changes in color.\n* The transformations are governed by logical rules, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\n* There may also be noise pixels in the output sequence.\n\nTo solve this task, I will need to carefully analyze each input-output pair and identify the patterns and transformations that convert the input into the output. Here's my plan of attack:\n\n1. Study each input-output pair and identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Analyze the transformations applied to each object in the input sequence, taking note of any noise pixels that may be present.\n3. Determine the overall pattern governing the transformations, including any logical rules or constraints that apply.\n4. Use this understanding to create a general algorithm for converting an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n5. Apply this algorithm to the test input sequence and verify that the output matches the expected result.\n\nHere's my initial analysis of the first input-output pair:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can identify three objects in the input sequence: Object_1 (colors 2 and 3), Object_2 (color 2), and Object_3 (color 6). These objects undergo various transformations, including moves, resizes, and changes in color.\n\nObject_1 moves from positions 1-2 to positions 3-4, while Object_2 remains stationary but grows in size from 2x2 to 4x4 pixels. Object_3 appears at position 6 and grows to 4x4 pixels. Finally, there are some noise pixels added to the output sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, I believe the key to solving this task is to understand the relationships between objects in the input sequence and how they are transformed into the output sequence. By identifying patterns and logical rules governing these transformations, I should be able to develop a general algorithm for converting input sequences into output sequences."
