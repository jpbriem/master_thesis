            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and copying objects. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all objects (represented by the numbers) have been moved to the right by one position, and their sizes have been doubled. This suggests that the transformation involves moving objects to the right and scaling them up.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all objects have been duplicated, and their positions have been shifted to the left by one position. This suggests that the transformation involves duplicating objects and shifting them to the left.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all objects have been duplicated, and their sizes have been tripled. This suggests that the transformation involves duplicating objects and scaling them up.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some combination of the following operations to the input sequence:\n\n* Moving objects to the right or left by one position\n* Scaling objects up or down by a factor of two or three\n* Duplicating objects\n\nWith this information, let's consider the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo apply the transformation pattern to this input, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. Based on the examples provided, it seems that each number in the input sequence represents an object. Therefore, we have nine objects in total, represented by the numbers 0 through 8.\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation pattern to this input. We can see that the objects in the input sequence are not moved or resized, so we don't need to perform any of those operations. However, we do need to duplicate each object three times, since there are three copies of each object in the output sequence.\n\nHere's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs requested, here is the description of the transformation in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"......\",\n\"Overall_Pattern\": \"describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"Instructions\": \"describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"Transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"Object_Description\": \"regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Transformed_Objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Output\": \"create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
