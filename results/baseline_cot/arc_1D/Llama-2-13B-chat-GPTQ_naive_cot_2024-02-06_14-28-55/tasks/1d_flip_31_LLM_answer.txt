prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects, resizing them, and changing their color. Here's my analysis of the input and output sequences:

Input Sequence:

* The input sequence consists of 12 pixels, each representing a color value (0-9).
* There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.
* The pixels are arranged in a linear fashion, with no overlapping objects.

Output Sequence:

* The output sequence also consists of 12 pixels, each representing a color value (0-9).
* The output sequence has undergone several transformations compared to the input sequence:
	+ Some pixels have moved to different positions in the sequence.
	+ Some pixels have been resized (either larger or smaller) than their original size.
	+ Some pixels have had their color changed.

Object Description:

* Objects in the input sequence can be described as follows:
	+ Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2} (represented by the two consecutive pixels with value 2)
	+ Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1} (represented by the single pixel with value 7 at index 4)
	+ Object_3: {color: 6, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1} (represented by the single pixel with value 6 at index 6)

Transformed Objects:

* After applying the transformation, the objects in the output sequence can be described as follows:
	+ Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2} (unchanged)
	+ Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1} (moved one position to the right and resized to 1x1)
	+ Object_3: {color: 6, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1} (remained unchanged)

Overall Pattern:

* The overall pattern in the input-output pairs is that objects are moved, resized, and sometimes have their color changed.

Instructions:

* To transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:
	1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.
	2. Move, resize, and change the color of each object according to the transformation pattern.
	3. Output the resulting sequence of pixels.

Transformation:

* The transformation function takes an input sequence of pixels and applies the necessary changes to produce the output sequence.
* The input sequence is copied and returned as the output sequence.

Test Output:

* Given the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], the expected output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
