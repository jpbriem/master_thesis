The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my understanding of the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 4, 0]).\n\t+ Resizing: Pixels can change size (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 4, 0]).\n\t+ Recoloring: Pixels can change color (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 5, 5, 0]).\n\t+ Overlapping: Pixels can overlap each other (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 4, 2]).\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be replaced with noise pixels (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 2, 4, 2, 0]).\n* Arithmetic operations: Pixels can be counted, sorted, or subjected to other arithmetic operations (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [2, 2, 2, 0]).\n* Conditional transformations: Transformations may be conditioned on certain criteria (e.g., if the previous pixel is blue, then the current pixel changes to red).\n\nBased on these patterns, I would infer that the goal of the transformation is to create a new output sequence that differs from the input sequence in some way, possibly by applying one or more of the above transformations.\n\nNow, let me turn to the specific test case you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAfter applying the transformation pattern, here's what I would expect the output sequence to look like:\n\nOutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn particular, I would expect the output sequence to have the same length as the input sequence, and for each pixel to have undergone one or more of the transformations listed above. Specifically, I would expect the following changes to occur:\n\n* Pixels 1, 2, and 3 will be resized to twice their original size.\n* Pixel 5 will be recolored to 5.\n* All pixels will be shifted horizontally by one position to the right.\n\nTherefore, the resulting output sequence will have the same length as the input sequence, but with different pixel values and positions."
