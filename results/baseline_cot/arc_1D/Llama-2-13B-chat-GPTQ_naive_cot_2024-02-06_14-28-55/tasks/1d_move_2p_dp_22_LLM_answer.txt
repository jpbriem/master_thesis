You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions attached to these operations that determine when they should be applied.

To describe the transformation pattern, we can start by identifying the objects in the input sequence. In the given input sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], we can identify several objects:

* Object 1: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (size: 8, position: 0-8, color: 1)
* Object 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (size: 8, position: 9-16, color: 1)

Now, let's apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence. We can start by moving Object 1 to the right by 1 position, since it has a size of 8 and is currently at position 0-8. This gives us:

* New Object 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (size: 8, position: 1-9, color: 1)

Next, we can scale Object 2 down by a factor of 2, since it has a size of 8 and we want to reduce its size to 4. This gives us:

* New Object 2: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] (size: 4, position: 9-16, color: 1)

Since Object 1 and Object 2 are now adjacent, we need to check if they overlap. Since they do not overlap, we can simply place Object 2 after Object 1. This gives us:

* Final Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] (size: 16, position: 0-16, color: 1)

As for the second part of the task, we need to create a test output sequence based on the given input sequence. Using the transformation pattern described above, we can generate the following test output sequence:

[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This sequence starts with 0 pixels of background color, followed by three objects of color 3, each with a size of 3 and placed at positions 1-3. Next, we have 9 pixels of background color, followed by another object of color 3 with a size of 3 placed at position 4. Finally, we have 0 pixels of background color to complete the sequence.

Therefore, the overall pattern of the transformation is:

* Move an object to the right by 1 position.
* Scale an object down by a factor of 2.
* Check if two objects overlap, and place one after the other if they do not.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
