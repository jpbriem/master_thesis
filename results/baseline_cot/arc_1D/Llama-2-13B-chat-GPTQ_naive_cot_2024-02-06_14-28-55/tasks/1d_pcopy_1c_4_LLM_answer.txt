[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:

* Objects: Each object in the input sequence has a specific size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of the same color) and position (represented by the starting index). Objects can be moved, resized, or removed.
* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be noise pixels (represented by the value 0), which do not belong to any object.
* Arithmetics: The transformation involves counting and sorting the objects based on their sizes and positions.
* Conditions: The transformation is conditioned on the properties of the objects, such as their size, position, and overlap.

Based on these patterns, I infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a mapping that takes each object in the input sequence and applies a series of transformations to it, depending on its properties. These transformations may include moving, resizing, removing, or copying objects, as well as adjusting their positions and sizes based on the conditions specified in the task.

Now, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output. First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties, such as their size, position, and color. We can then apply the following transformations to each object:

1. Move objects to their correct positions based on their size and the positions of other objects.
2. Resize objects to their appropriate size based on their color and the distances between objects.
3. Remove overlapping objects or merge them into a single object.
4. Copy objects to create additional instances of the same object if necessary.
5. Adjust the positions and sizes of objects based on the conditions specified in the task.

After applying these transformations, we will obtain the output sequence, which represents the transformed version of the original input sequence.

To summarize, the transformation pattern for the input-output pairs is a mapping that takes each object in the input sequence and applies a series of transformations to it, depending on its properties. These transformations may include moving, resizing, removing, or copying objects, as well as adjusting their positions and sizes based on the conditions specified in the task.

Finally, here is the transformation function in JSON format:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
"Example_2": "..."
},
"overall_pattern": "Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
"instructions": "Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step",
"transformation": {
"input": "Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!",
"object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color",
"transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color",
"output": "Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!"
},
"test_output": "Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!"
}

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
