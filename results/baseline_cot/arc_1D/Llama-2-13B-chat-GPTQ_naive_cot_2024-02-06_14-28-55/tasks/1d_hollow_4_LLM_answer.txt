[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects (pixels) around, resizing them, and changing their color. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence of [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output sequence is obtained by applying the following transformations:

* Move the first two pixels (0, 0) to the beginning of the sequence, so the new sequence starts with [0, 0, 2, 2].
* Resize the third pixel (2) to twice its original size, so it becomes [2, 2].
* Remove the last two pixels (2, 0), leaving us with [0, 2, 2, 0].

Therefore, the output sequence is [0, 0, 2, 2, 0].

Example 2:
In this example, we have an input sequence of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]. The output sequence is obtained by applying the following transformations:

* Move the first four pixels (0, 0, 0, 0) to the beginning of the sequence, so the new sequence starts with [0, 0, 4, 4].
* Resize the fifth pixel (4) to half its original size, so it becomes [4, 0].
* Remove the last four pixels (4, 4, 4, 4), leaving us with [0, 4, 0].

Therefore, the output sequence is [0, 4, 0].

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence of [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]. The output sequence is obtained by applying the following transformations:

* Move the first three pixels (0, 0, 3) to the beginning of the sequence, so the new sequence starts with [0, 0, 3].
* Resize the fourth pixel (3) to thrice its original size, so it becomes [3, 3].
* Remove the last three pixels (3, 3, 3), leaving us with [0, 3, 3].

Therefore, the output sequence is [0, 3, 3].

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving objects around, resizing them, and removing some objects entirely. To perform the transformation, we need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation based on the rules described above.

Now, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:

input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

To transform this input sequence, we need to follow the same pattern as before. Here's my analysis of each object in the input sequence:

Object 1: [5] - This object has five pixels, and since there are no noise pixels, we can simply move it to the beginning of the sequence without any changes.

Object 2: [5, 5] - This object consists of two pixels with the value 5. We can resize the first pixel to twice its original size, so it becomes [10, 5].

Object 3: [5, 5, 5] - This object consists of three pixels with the value 5. We can resize the second pixel to thrice its original size, so it becomes [15, 5, 5].

Object 4: [5, 5, 5, 5] - This object consists of four pixels with the value 5. We can remove the last two pixels, leaving us with [10, 5, 5].

Object 5: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] - This object consists of five pixels with the value 5. Since there are no noise pixels, we can simply move it to the end of the sequence without any changes.

Therefore, the transformed output sequence would be: [0, 0, 10, 5, 15, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to perform additional transformations.
