The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0] and an output sequence [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0].\n\nThe transformation pattern for this example can be described as follows:\n\n* Move objects: Objects 1 and 2 are moved one position to the right.\n* Scale objects: Object 3 is scaled up by a factor of 5.\n* Recolor objects: Object 4 is recolored from 0 to 2.\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] and an output sequence [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n\nThe transformation pattern for this example is similar to Example 1, but with some additional moves and scalings:\n\n* Move objects: Objects 1 and 2 are moved two positions to the right. Object 4 is moved one position to the left.\n* Scale objects: Object 3 is scaled up by a factor of 5, and object 5 is scaled down by a factor of 2.\n* Recolor objects: Object 6 is recolored from 0 to 9.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1] and an output sequence [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2].\n\nThe transformation pattern for this example is more complex than the previous two examples, involving multiple moves, scales, and recolors:\n\n* Move objects: Objects 1 and 2 are moved three positions to the right. Object 4 is moved two positions to the left.\n* Scale objects: Object 3 is scaled up by a factor of 5, and object 5 is scaled down by a factor of 2.\n* Recolor objects: Objects 6 and 7 are recolored from 0 to 9, and object 8 is recolored from 1 to 2.\n\nNow, let's apply these patterns to the given test input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns above, here's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0]\n\nAs requested, I will provide the transformation instructions in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"....\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else."
