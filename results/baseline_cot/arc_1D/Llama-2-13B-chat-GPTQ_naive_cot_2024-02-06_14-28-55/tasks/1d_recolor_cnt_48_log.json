The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the input and output sequences. The input sequence is `[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`. This sequence consists of a series of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 7, with some pixels being \"noisy\" (i.e., having a value of 0).\n\nThe output sequence is `[0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This sequence also consists of a series of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 9, but with some key differences compared to the input sequence:\n\n* Some pixels have changed color (e.g., the first pixel has changed from 0 to 9).\n* Some pixels have been removed (e.g., there are no longer any pixels with value 7 in the output sequence).\n* Some pixels have been duplicated (e.g., there are now multiple pixels with value 4 in the output sequence).\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer that the transformation from input to output involves a combination of object transformations (such as moving, resizing, and copying objects), noise addition/removal, and arithmetical operations (such as counting and sorting).\n\nNow, let me walk you through the steps to transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence.\n\nFrom the input sequence, we can identify several objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\n* Object 3: {color: 7, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 3}\n\nStep 2: Apply object transformations.\n\nFor each object, we need to apply appropriate transformations to create the corresponding object in the output sequence. Here are the transformations for each object:\n\n* Object 1: Move 2 pixels to the right and change color to 9.\n* Object 2: Remove all pixels.\n* Object 3: Copy the original object and move it 3 pixels to the left.\n\nStep 3: Add noise pixels.\n\nTo simulate the introduction of noise into the system, we need to add random pixels to the output sequence. We'll add 4 pixels with random values between 0 and 4.\n\nStep 4: Sort the output sequence.\n\nFinally, we need to sort the output sequence to ensure that the objects are properly aligned and the noise pixels are evenly distributed.\n\nHere's the complete transformation process in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Object_1\": \"move 2 pixels to the right and change color to 9\",\n    \"Object_2\": \"remove all pixels\",\n    \"Object_3\": \"copy the original object and move it 3 pixels to the left\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"apply object transformations, add noise pixels, and sort the output sequence\",\n  \"instructions\": \"transform the input sequence into the output sequence using the specified object transformations, noise addition, and sorting\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": \"identify objects in the input sequence\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"apply object transformations to create corresponding objects in the output sequence\",\n    \"output\": \"[9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n  },\n  \"test_output\": \"[9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nTherefore, the output sequence for the given input sequence is `[9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`."
