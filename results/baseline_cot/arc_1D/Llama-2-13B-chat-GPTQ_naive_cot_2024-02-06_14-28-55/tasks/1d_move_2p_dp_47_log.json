The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:\n\n* Moving objects (represented by non-zero values) to different positions in the sequence\n* Changing the color of objects (represented by changes in the value of the corresponding pixel)\n* Removing objects (represented by zeros in the output sequence)\n* Copying objects (represented by unchanged values in the output sequence)\n\nHere's a high-level description of the transformation pattern:\n\n* If an object overlaps with another object of the same color, they merge into a single object with the larger size and the color of the overlapping objects.\n* If an object does not overlap with any other object of the same color, it remains unchanged.\n* If an object overlaps with an object of a different color, the smaller object is removed and replaced with a new object of the same color as the overlapping object.\n* If an object does not overlap with any other object, it is moved to the beginning of the sequence.\n\nNow, let me apply this pattern to the given test input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. Based on the pattern described above, we can see that there are three objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5] (size: 5, color: 5)\n* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 0, color: 0)\n* Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0] (size: 1, color: 8)\n\nNext, we need to apply the transformation rules to each object:\n\nObject 1:\n\n* Merge with Object 2 since they overlap and both have color 5.\n* Size increases to 6.\n\nObject 2:\n\n* Remove since it has no overlap with any other object.\n\nObject 3:\n\n* Move to the beginning of the sequence since it does not overlap with any other object.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to explain the reasoning behind each step."
