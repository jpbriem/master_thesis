The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:\n\n* Moving objects (represented by non-zero values) to different positions in the sequence\n* Scaling objects up or down in size\n* Removing objects completely\n* Changing the color of objects\n\nHere's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], which contains several objects of color 2. After applying the transformation, we get the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nAs we can see, the objects of color 2 have been moved to different positions in the sequence, but their size has remained unchanged. Additionally, some noise pixels (represented by 0 values) have been removed.\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], which contains several objects of color 5. After applying the transformation, we get the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0].\n\nAs we can see, the objects of color 5 have been scaled up by a factor of 5, while the other pixels have been set to 0.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], which contains several objects of color 5. After applying the transformation, we get the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0].\n\nAs we can see, the objects of color 5 have been moved to different positions in the sequence, and their size has been increased by a factor of 5.\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0].\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, here's what I would expect the transformation to do:\n\n* Move the object of color 4 at index 4 to a different position in the sequence (perhaps to the beginning or end of the sequence)\n* Scale the object of color 4 up or down in size\n* Remove any noise pixels (represented by 0 values)\n* Possibly change the color of the object of color 4 to another value\n\nTo perform the transformation, I would need to carefully examine the input sequence and determine the appropriate actions to take based on the patterns observed in the previous examples. Here's one possible transformation that could produce the desired output:\n\nTransformed output sequence: [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n\nAs we can see, the object of color 4 at index 4 has been moved to the beginning of the sequence, and its size has been increased by a factor of 4. Additionally, any noise pixels (represented by 0 values) have been removed."
