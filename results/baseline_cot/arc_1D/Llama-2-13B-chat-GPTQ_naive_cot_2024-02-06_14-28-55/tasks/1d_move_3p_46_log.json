            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there are noise pixels in the input sequence that need to be accounted for.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the input sequence you provided:\n\n`input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this input sequence, we can identify several objects:\n\n* Object 1: `color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 7, size: 7` (a group of seven consecutive pixels with color 7)\n* Object 2: `color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 14, size: 6` (a group of six consecutive pixels with color 7, starting at index 8)\n* Object 3: `color: 7, start_index: 15, end_index: 21, size: 6` (a group of six consecutive pixels with color 7, starting at index 15)\n\nNow, let's consider the desired output sequence. From the examples provided, we know that the output sequence should consist of the original input sequence with some modifications. Specifically, we need to:\n\n* Move Object 1 to the beginning of the sequence\n* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2\n* Change the color of Object 3 to 0\n\nWith these requirements in mind, here's the transformation we need to apply to the input sequence:\n\n1. Move Object 1 to the beginning of the sequence:\n\t* Start index: 1, end index: 7, size: 7\n\t* New start index: 0, new end index: 6, new size: 7\n2. Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2:\n\t* Start index: 8, end index: 14, size: 6\n\t* New start index: 8, new end index: 22, new size: 12\n3. Change the color of Object 3 to 0:\n\t* Start index: 15, end index: 21, size: 6\n\t* New start index: 15, new end index: 21, new size: 6, new color: 0\n\nApplying these transformations to the input sequence yields the following output sequence:\n\n`output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nAs you can see, Object 1 has been moved to the beginning of the sequence, Object 2 has been scaled up by a factor of 2, and Object 3 has had its color changed to 0.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to perform additional tasks related to this input-output pair."
