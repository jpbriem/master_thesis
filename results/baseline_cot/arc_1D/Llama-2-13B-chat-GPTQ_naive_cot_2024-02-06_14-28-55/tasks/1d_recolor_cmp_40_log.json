            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nFrom the examples, we can see that the transformations involve moving objects (represented by consecutive identical pixels), resizing objects, and changing the color of objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels added to the output sequence.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand the rules governing these transformations and apply them to the given input sequence. Here's my analysis of the input and output sequences based on the examples:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* The input sequence consists of 16 pixels, each represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 9.\n* There are five objects in the input sequence, each represented by a group of consecutive identical pixels.\n* Each object has a specific color, represented by the integer value associated with each pixel.\n* The objects are not necessarily rectangular in shape, as they can be moved and resized.\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* The output sequence also consists of 16 pixels, each represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 9.\n* The output sequence contains the same objects as the input sequence, but with some transformations applied.\n* Some objects may be moved to different positions, resized, or have their color changed.\n* Noise pixels may be added to the output sequence.\n\nBased on the examples, here are the observed patterns and rules governing the transformations:\n\n1. Object Movement: Objects can be moved to different positions in the output sequence. This movement can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\n2. Object Resizing: Objects can be resized, either growing or shrinking in size. The size of an object is determined by the number of consecutive identical pixels it contains.\n3. Color Changes: Objects can change color, either retaining their original color or switching to a different color.\n4. Noise Pixels: Noise pixels can be added to the output sequence, potentially obscuring or modifying the original object shapes.\n5. Conditional Transformations: The transformations mentioned above may be conditional, meaning they only occur under certain conditions.\n\nNow, let me describe the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\n\n* Input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we see that the objects have been resized and moved around, with some objects overlapping each other. The color changes are minimal, with only one object switching from 9 to 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\n* Input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\nHere, we see that the objects have been heavily resized and moved around, with many objects overlapping each other. The color changes are more pronounced, with several objects switching from 9 to 4.\n\nExample 3:\n\n* Input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\nThis example is similar to Example 2, with heavy object resizing and movement, and significant color changes.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform the test input sequence into its output sequence:\n\n1. Move objects: Identify groups of consecutive identical pixels and move them to the appropriate position in the output sequence.\n2. Resize objects: Adjust the size of objects based on the number of consecutive identical pixels they contain.\n3. Change object color: Replace objects with different colors when necessary.\n4. Add noise pixels: Randomly add noise pixels to the output sequence to simulate imperfections in the image.\n\nWith these rules in mind, here's the transformed test input sequence:\n\nTransformed Test Input Sequence:\n\n[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd here's the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format:\n\nnumpy.array([0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0])\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
