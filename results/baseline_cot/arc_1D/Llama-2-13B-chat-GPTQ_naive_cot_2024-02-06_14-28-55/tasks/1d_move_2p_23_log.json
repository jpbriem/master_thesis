            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, changing size, and sometimes disappearing or appearing. The noise pixels also seem to play a role in the transformation.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I observe:\n\n* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence, each consisting of a run of consecutive pixels of the same color. Object 1 has colors 0 and 3, object 2 has color 3, and object 3 has color 3.\n* Relations between objects: Objects 1 and 2 are adjacent and have a distance of 1 pixel between them. Object 2 overlaps with object 3 by 1 pixel.\n* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, I can make the following deductions about the desired transformation:\n\n* Objects: Object 1 will move one pixel to the right, object 2 will shrink by one pixel, and object 3 will appear at the left end of the sequence.\n* Relations between objects: Object 1 will now be separated from object 2 by two pixels, and object 3 will overlap with object 2 by one pixel.\n* Noise pixels: None.\n\nTherefore, the expected output sequence would be:\n```\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nHere's the transformation steps in detail:\n\n1. Move object 1 one pixel to the right:\n\t* Start index: 1\n\t* End index: 2\n\t* Size: 1\n2. Shrink object 2 by one pixel:\n\t* Start index: 2\n\t* End index: 3\n\t* Size: -1\n3. Appear object 3 at the left end of the sequence:\n\t* Start index: 0\n\t* End index: 1\n\t* Size: 3\n\nAnd there we have it! The transformed output sequence is `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
