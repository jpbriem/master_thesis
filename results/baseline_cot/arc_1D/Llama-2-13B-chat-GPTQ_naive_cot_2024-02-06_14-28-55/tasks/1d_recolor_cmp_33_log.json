            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, let me describe the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}\nObject_2: {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 3}\nObject_3: {color: 8, start_index: 8, end_index: 10, size: 3}\n\nBased on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving objects, changing their size, and adjusting their position. In particular, objects seem to be moved together or apart, and their sizes appear to be modified by adding or removing pixels. Additionally, there may be some noise pixels added or removed during the transformation process.\n\nTo transform the input sequence, I would need to apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Move Object_1 to the left by 2 positions, so that it overlaps with Object_2.\n\nStep 2: Resize Object_2 to size 2 by removing one pixel at index 6.\n\nStep 3: Move Object_3 to the right by 1 position, so that it overlaps with Object_1.\n\nStep 4: Add noise pixel at index 2.\n\nStep 5: Remove noise pixel at index 9.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the steps."
