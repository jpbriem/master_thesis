The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with adjacent pixels of the same color being designated as objects. The transformation from input to output appears to follow a specific pattern involving object movements, resizing, and color changes.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [0, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all objects remain the same size and position, but their colors change. Objects 1 and 2 switch colors, while objects 3 and 4 become the same color as object 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, all objects double in size and maintain their original positions.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all objects become twice as large as they were originally.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and create a new empty output sequence of the same length.\n2. Iterate over the input sequence and identify objects based on their color.\n3. For each object, check if it needs to move, resize, or change color. If so, perform the appropriate action.\n4. Once all objects have been processed, return the resulting output sequence.\n\nFinally, here is the test output sequence for the given input:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
