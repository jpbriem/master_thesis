You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence of [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], which consists of several objects of color 1, with some noise pixels (0) scattered throughout. The output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0], where the objects of color 1 have been moved together and expanded to cover the entire sequence.

Example 2:
Here, we have an input sequence of [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0], which contains five objects of color 5, each with a size of 5 pixels. The output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0], where the objects of color 5 have been copied and aligned next to each other.

Example 3:
For this example, we have an input sequence of [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], which consists entirely of object 4, with a size of 4 pixels. The output sequence is [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0, 0], where the object of color 4 has been duplicated and expanded to cover the entire sequence.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving and scaling objects in the input sequence to create the output sequence. Specifically, objects of the same color are combined by moving them together and expanding them to fill the entire sequence. Additionally, noise pixels (represented by 0 in the input and output sequences) are preserved but do not affect the transformation.

Now, let me analyze the test case you provided:

input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]

This input sequence consists of six objects of color 6, each with a size of 6 pixels. There are also some noise pixels scattered throughout the sequence. To transform this input sequence into the corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the transformation pattern described above.

Here's my step-by-step description of the transformation:

1. Move and align objects of the same color together:
	* Objects of color 6 are moved together and aligned so that they form a single contiguous block of color 6.
2. Scale objects to fill the entire sequence:
	* The aligned objects of color 6 are scaled up to fill the entire sequence, so that there is no more noise pixels (0) present in the output sequence.

And here's the resulting output sequence:

output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, the output sequence consists solely of objects of color 6, with no noise pixels remaining. Each object has been scaled up to fill the entire sequence, creating a cohesive and visually appealing output.
