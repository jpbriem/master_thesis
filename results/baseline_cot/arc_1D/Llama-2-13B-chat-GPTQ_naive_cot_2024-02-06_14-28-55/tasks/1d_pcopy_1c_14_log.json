The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 9, representing different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.\n* The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of predefined rules.\n\nBased on the examples given, here are some observations about the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, and changing color.\n* Noise pixels can be added or removed from the sequence.\n* Arithmetical operations can be performed on objects and their properties (e.g., counting, sorting).\n* Conditional rules can be applied to determine the outcome of these operations.\n\nNow, let me describe the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation needed to convert the input sequence into the output sequence for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nNo transformation is needed - the input sequence is already in the correct order.\n\nExample 2:\nObject 2 needs to be moved from index 2 to index 0, and object 0 needs to be removed.\n\nExample 3:\nObject 2 needs to be duplicated and placed at indices 0 and 2, and object 0 needs to be removed.\n\nBased on these observations, I suggest the following transformation pattern for any input sequence:\n\n1. Check if there are any objects in the input sequence. If there are no objects, return the original input sequence.\n2. Iterate over the input sequence and identify objects based on adjacent pixels of the same color.\n3. Apply the following transformations to each object:\na. Move objects to different positions in the sequence according to the specified rules.\nb. Resize objects based on the specified rules.\nc. Change the color of objects according to the specified rules.\nd. Add or remove noise pixels as needed.\n4. Return the transformed output sequence.\n\nWith this understanding of the task, I am ready to provide the transformation for the test input sequence you provided. Please go ahead and provide the input sequence, and I will generate the output sequence accordingly."
