[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions attached to these operations that determine when they should be applied.

To describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs, we can identify some common patterns:

* Objects can move horizontally or vertically, or both.
* Objects can change size, either growing or shrinking.
* Objects can change color.
* Objects can be removed or copied.

Based on these patterns, we can infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences. In general, the output sequence will consist of the original input sequence with objects moved, resized, or changed in some way.

Now, let's apply this understanding to the given test case:

Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Object description:

* Object 1 (color 4): Start index 1, end index 4, size 4.
* Object 2 (color 0): Start index 5, end index 6, size 1.

Transformed objects:

* Object 1 (color 4): Move right 1 pixel, resize to size 3.
* Object 2 (color 0): Copy once, then move left 1 pixel.

Output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In summary, the input sequence consists of five objects of color 4, each with a size of 4 pixels. One object is moved right one pixel and resized to size 3, while another object is copied once and then moved left one pixel. The resulting output sequence reflects these changes.

Here's the JSON response:
