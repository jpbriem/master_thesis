[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:

* Each object in the input sequence has a specific color (0, 2, 3, or 5) and a specific size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of that color).
* The output sequence contains only objects of color 0 (background color), with each object having the same size as the corresponding object in the input sequence.
* If an object in the input sequence overlaps with another object of the same color, the overlapping pixels are removed from both objects in the output sequence.

Using this understanding, we can now describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output:

1. Copy the input sequence.
2. Iterate over each object in the input sequence:
a. Check if the current object overlaps with any other object of the same color. If so, remove the overlapping pixels from both objects.
b. Set the color of the current object to 0 (background color).
c. Increase the size of the current object by the number of consecutive pixels of the original color.
3. Return the transformed output sequence.

Here's the code to implement these steps in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_seq):
    # Step 1: Copy the input sequence
    output_seq = np.copy(input_seq)
    
    # Step 2: Transform each object in the input sequence
    for i in range(len(output_seq)):
        obj = output_seq[i]
        
        # Check for overlapping objects
        for j in range(i+1, len(output_seq)):
            if output_seq[j] == obj:
                # Remove overlapping pixels
                obj = np.delete(obj, np.where(output_seq[j] == obj)[0])
        
        # Set object color to 0
        obj[:] = 0
        
        # Increase object size
        obj = np.insert(obj, obj.size, obj[0], axis=0)
    
    return output_seq

# Test the function with Example_1
input_seq = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
output_seq = transform(input_seq)
print(output_seq)
```
And here's the expected output:
```json
{
"description": {
"Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
"Example_2": "",
"Overall_Pattern": "Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
"Instructions": "Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step",
"Transformation": {
"Input": "Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!",
"Object_Description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color",
"Transformed_Objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color",
"Output": "Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!"
},
"Test_Output": "Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!"
}
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
