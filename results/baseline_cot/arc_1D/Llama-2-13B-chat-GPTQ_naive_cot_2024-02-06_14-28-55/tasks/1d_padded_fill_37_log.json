The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing different pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nFrom the examples, we can see that the transformations involve moving objects (pixels) around, resizing them, and changing their color. The transformations seem to be applied in a specific order, with the first object being moved or resized, then the second object, and so on.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to identify the patterns and rules behind the transformations and apply them to the given input sequence. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of alternating pixels of two colors (1 and 0). The output sequence applies the following transformations:\n\n* All pixels of color 1 are moved one position to the right.\n* All pixels of color 0 are removed.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence consists solely of pixels of color 1, shifted one position to the right.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of repeating the value 5 five times. The output sequence applies the following transformations:\n\n* All pixels of value 5 are duplicated five times.\n* All other pixels (of value 0) are removed.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence consists solely of pixels of value 5, repeated five times.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5]\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of alternating pixels of two values (0 and 5). The output sequence applies the following transformations:\n\n* All pixels of value 0 are removed.\n* All pixels of value 5 are duplicated three times.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence consists solely of pixels of value 5, repeated three times.\n\nBased on these observations, we can deduce the general pattern for the transformation:\n\n1. Move objects (pixels) one position to the right.\n2. Remove any pixels of value 0.\n3. Duplicate pixels of value 5, applying the number of duplicates as a parameter.\n\nNow let's apply this pattern to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWe can see that the input sequence consists of alternating pixels of two values (0 and 7). Applying the transformation pattern above, we get:\n\n1. Move all pixels of value 0 one position to the left, leaving a gap.\n2. Remove all pixels of value 0.\n3. Duplicate all pixels of value 7, applying the number of duplicates as a parameter. In this case, we duplicate each pixel of value 7 three times.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence would be:\n\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]\n\nI hope this helps!
