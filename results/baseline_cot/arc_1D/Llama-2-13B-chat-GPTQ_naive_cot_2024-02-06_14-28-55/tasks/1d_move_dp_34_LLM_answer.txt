You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves making copies of certain objects, changing their sizes, and moving them around in the sequence. Additionally, some objects may be removed or replaced with others.

For the given input sequence `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I would do to transform it into the corresponding output sequence:

1. First, I notice that there are three identical objects (with value 8) in the input sequence. To simplify the transformation process, I will create separate variables to represent these objects: `obj1 = [8, 8, 8]`, `obj2 = [8, 8, 8]`, and `obj3 = [8, 8, 8]`.
2. Next, I see that the second object (`obj2`) needs to be moved to the third position in the output sequence. To achieve this, I will create a new object `tmp` with the same value as `obj2`: `tmp = obj2`. Then, I will move `obj2` to the third position by assigning it to the index `2` in the output sequence: `output[2] = obj2`.
3. After that, I need to remove the fourth object (`obj3`) from the input sequence because it has already been copied and moved to the third position. So, I will simply remove it from the input sequence: `input.pop(4)`.
4. Now, I need to replace the fifth object (`obj1`) with a new object that has the same value but a different size. Since the new object should have size 2, I will create a new array `new_obj1` with twice the number of elements as `obj1`: `new_obj1 = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`. Then, I will replace `obj1` with `new_obj1`: `output[5:] = new_obj1`.
5. Finally, I need to add the remaining objects back to the output sequence. Since the sixth object (`obj2`) has already been moved to the third position, I will simply assign it back to its original index `6` in the output sequence: `output[6] = obj2`. Similarly, I will assign the seventh and eighth objects (`obj1` and `obj3`) back to their original indices `7` and `8`, respectively: `output[7] = obj1`, `output[8] = obj3`.

Here's the final output sequence: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
