            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [6, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, changing size, and sometimes changing color. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we see three objects (colors 7, 7, and 6) that move horizontally and change size. Object 1 grows from 2 pixels wide to 3 pixels wide, while object 2 shrinks from 3 pixels wide to 2 pixels wide. Object 3 moves leftward by 1 pixel.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have four objects (colors 8, 8, 8, and 1) that move vertically and change size. Objects 1 and 2 grow from 1 pixel tall to 2 pixels tall, while object 3 shrinks from 2 pixels tall to 1 pixel tall. Object 4 moves upward by 1 pixel.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we see two objects (colors 2 and 7) that move and change size. Object 1 grows from 1 pixel wide to 2 pixels wide, while object 2 shrinks from 2 pixels wide to 1 pixel wide.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some combination of the following operations to the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Moving objects left or right by a fixed number of pixels\n* Changing the size of an object by adding or removing pixels\n* Changing the color of an object\n\nTo transform the given input sequence, we need to apply these operations in a way that produces the desired output sequence. Here's my proposed approach:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObjects:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 6] (color 6, size 3 pixels wide)\n* Object 2: [4, 4, 4] (color 4, size 3 pixels wide)\n* Object 3: [0, 0, 0] (color 0, size 1 pixel wide)\n\n2. Apply the transformation operations:\n\na. Move Object 1 left by 1 pixel: [0, 0, 5]\n\nb. Change Object 2's color to 7 and increase its size to 4 pixels wide: [4, 4, 7]\n\nc. Move Object 3 up by 1 pixel: [0, 0, 1]\n\nd. Change Object 1's color to 2 and decrease its size to 2 pixels wide: [2, 2, 5]\n\ne. Move Object 2 left by 1 pixel: [4, 4, 6]\n\nf. Change Object 3's color to 8 and increase its size to 2 pixels wide: [1, 1, 8]\n\ng. Move Object 1 right by 1 pixel: [2, 2, 5]\n\nh. Change Object 2's color to 8 and increase its size to 3 pixels wide: [4, 4, 8]\n\ni. Move Object 3 down by 1 pixel: [1, 1, 0]\n\nj. Change Object 1's color to 7 and increase its size to 3 pixels wide: [7, 7, 5]\n\nk. Move Object 2 right by 1 pixel: [4, 4, 6]\n\nl. Change Object 3's color to 2 and decrease its size to 1 pixel wide: [1, 1, 2]\n\nm. Move Object 1 left by 1 pixel: [6, 6, 5]\n\nn. Change Object 2's color to 7 and increase its size to 3 pixels wide: [7, 7, 6]\n\no. Move Object 3 left by 1 pixel: [1, 1, 0]\n\np. Change Object 1's color to 2 and decrease its size to 2 pixels wide: [2, 2, 5]\n\nq. Move Object 2 right by 1 pixel: [4, 4, 6]\n\nr. Change Object 3's color to 8 and increase its size to 2 pixels wide: [1, 1, 8]\n\nNow, let me create the test output sequence based on the above operations:\n\nOutput sequence: [7, 7, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 0]\n\nAs requested, here's the description of the transformation in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
