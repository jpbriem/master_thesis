[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there may be conditions attached to these operations that determine whether they are applied or not.

For the given input sequence `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]`, here's my analysis:

* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each consisting of a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color. The objects are:
	+ Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 7, size: 7}
	+ Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 14, size: 7}
	+ Object_3: {color: 7, start_index: 15, end_index: 21, size: 7}
	+ Object_4: {color: 7, start_index: 22, end_index: 28, size: 7}
* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.
* Transformation rules: Based on the examples provided, the transformation rules can be summarized as follows:
	+ Move objects: If an object overlaps with another object, it moves to the right (i.e., increases its index) by the amount of the overlap.
	+ Scale objects: Objects can be scaled up or down by a factor of 2 or 3, depending on their color.
	+ Change color: Objects can change color based on certain conditions.
* Conditions: Some of the transformations are conditioned on the color of the object. For example, if an object has color 7 and is not overlapped by any other object, it will be scaled up by a factor of 3.

Now, let me describe the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:

Example_1:
Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]
Output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]

In this example, all objects remain the same size and position, but their color changes. The objects are simply copied from the input sequence to the output sequence, but with a different color.

Example_2:
Input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
Output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]

In this example, all objects are moved to the right by one pixel, and their color changes. This creates a new object at the left side of the output sequence.

Example_3:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0]

In this example, all objects are moved to the right by six pixels, and their color changes. This creates a new object at the left side of the output sequence.

Based on these examples, we can infer that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. The specific operations applied to each object depend on its color and position in the sequence.

Now, let me describe the transformation actions needed to transform the test input sequence into its output sequence:

Test input sequence: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]

1. Object_1: Move to the right by 7 pixels, change color to 9.
2. Object_2: Move to the right by 7 pixels, keep color 7.
3. Object_3: Move to the right by 7 pixels, keep color 7.
4. Object_4: Move to the right by 7 pixels, keep color 7.

Transformation output sequence: [9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]

As requested, I will provide the transformation output sequence in numpy array format: `np.array([9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9])`.
