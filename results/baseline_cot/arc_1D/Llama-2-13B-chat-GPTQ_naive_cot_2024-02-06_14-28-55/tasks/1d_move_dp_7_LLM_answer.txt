prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 8]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, resizing, and changing color. Additionally, there are noise pixels that appear to be randomized. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:

Example 1:
Input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8]

In this example, we see three objects (colors 3, 3, and 3) that are moved horizontally to the left by one pixel position. The background color changes from 0 to 8.

Example 2:
Input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 8]

Here, we have two objects (colors 2 and 2) that are moved vertically downward by one pixel position. Again, the background color changes from 0 to 8.

Example 3:
Input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8]

In this example, we see three objects (colors 3, 3, and 3) that are resized to twice their original size. The background color remains unchanged.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some combination of the following operations to the objects in the input sequence:

* Moving objects horizontally or vertically by one pixel position
* Resizing objects by a factor of 2 or 3
* Changing the background color to a different value
* Adding noise pixels randomly

To transform the test input sequence [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8], we need to apply these operations accordingly. Here's the description of the transformation:

Transformation:

* Move object at index 0 (color 4) horizontally to the right by one pixel position
* Resize object at index 1 (color 4) by a factor of 2
* Change the background color from 0 to 8
* Add noise pixels randomly to the output sequence

Overall Pattern:

The input-output relationship for all input-output pairs can be described as follows:

* Objects move horizontally or vertically by one pixel position
* Objects resize by a factor of 2 or 3
* Background color changes to a different value
* Noise pixels are added randomly

Instructions:

To transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color values.
2. Apply the appropriate transformation operations to each object based on its color value and position in the sequence.
3. Add noise pixels randomly to the output sequence.

Transformation:

Input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8]

Object Description:

* Object at index 0 (color 4): size=2, position=(0, 0), color=4
* Object at index 1 (color 4): size=3, position=(1, 0), color=4
* Background color: 8

Transformed Objects:

* Object at index 0 (color 4): size=2, position=(0, 0), color=4
* Object at index 1 (color 4): size=3, position=(1, 0), color=4
* Background color: 8

Output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8]

Test Output: np.array([0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8])

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain anything else.
