            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, and copying objects, as well as changing their color.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I would do to transform it into the corresponding output sequence:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence:\n\t* Object 1: `7` (color: 7, start index: 2, end index: 3, size: 1)\n\t* Object 2: `0` (color: 0, start index: 0, end index: 1, size: 1)\n2. Apply transformations to objects based on their properties:\n\t* Object 1: Move object 1 one position to the right (from index 2 to index 3).\n\t* Object 2: Scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions (from size 1 to size 2).\n3. Update the output sequence based on the transformed objects:\n\t* Output sequence: `[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nHere's the description of the transformation in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Object_1\": \"moved one position to the right\",\n\"Object_2\": \"scaled by a factor of 2 in both dimensions\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"moved and scaled objects\",\n\"instructions\": \"move and scale objects based on their properties\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": [\"Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 1}\", \"Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, size: 1}\"],\n\"transformed_objects\": [\"Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 3, end_index: 3, size: 1}\", \"Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 2, size: 2}\"],\n\"output\": \"[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
