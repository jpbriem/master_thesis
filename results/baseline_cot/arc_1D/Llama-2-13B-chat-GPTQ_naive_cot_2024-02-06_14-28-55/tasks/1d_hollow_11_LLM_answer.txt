[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of the three examples:

Example 1:
In this example, we see two objects of color 1, one of size 2x2 and the other of size 1x1. The output sequence has these objects moved to the left and right sides of the sequence, respectively. Specifically, the 2x2 object moves to the left side of the sequence, overlapping with the background color (represented by 0), while the 1x1 object moves to the right side of the sequence.

Example 2:
Here, we have three objects of color 5, each of size 5x1. In the output sequence, these objects are scaled down to size 0x1, effectively removing them from the sequence.

Example 3:
In this example, there is a single object of color 1, spanning the entire input sequence. The output sequence shows this object being split into five smaller objects of size 1x1, each with the same color.

Based on these patterns, I can infer that the desired transformation is a function that takes an input sequence of pixels and applies the following operations to each object in the sequence:

* Move: Objects may be moved to the left or right sides of the sequence, overlapping with background color if necessary.
* Scale: Objects may be scaled up or down in size, potentially disappearing from the sequence if their size becomes too small.
* Remove: Objects may be removed entirely from the sequence, leaving behind empty space.
* Copy: New objects may be copied from the input sequence and added to the output sequence.
* Recolor: Objects may be given a new color.

To apply these operations, I would suggest using NumPy arrays to represent both the input and output sequences. First, I would iterate through the input sequence, identifying objects based on their size and color. Next, I would apply the desired operations to each object, updating the output sequence accordingly. Finally, I would return the completed output sequence as a NumPy array.

Here's some sample Python code to illustrate this process:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_seq):
    # Initialize output sequence
    output_seq = np.zeros((len(input_seq), 1))
    
    # Iterate through input sequence
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        # Identify current object
        obj = None
        for j in range(i, min(i+3, len(input_seq))):
            if input_seq[j]!= 0:
                obj = input_seq[j:]
                break
        
        # Apply operations based on object type
        if obj == [0, 0, 0]:  # Background color
            output_seq[i] = [0] * len(obj)
        elif obj == [1, 1, 1]:  # Object 1
            output_seq[i] = [1, 0, 0] + obj[1:]
        else:  # Object 2
            output_seq[i] = [0, 1, 0] + obj[1:]
    
    return np.array(output_seq)

# Test cases
print(transform([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))  # Example 1
print(transform([5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))  # Example 2
print(transform([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]))  # Example 3

# Test input sequence
print(transform([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
