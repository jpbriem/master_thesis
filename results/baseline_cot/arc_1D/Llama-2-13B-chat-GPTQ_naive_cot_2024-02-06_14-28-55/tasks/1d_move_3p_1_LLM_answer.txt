[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:

* Objects: The input and output sequences can be divided into objects, which are contiguous sequences of pixels of the same color. For example, in Example_1, the input sequence consists of five objects of color 5, each with a size of 5 pixels.
* Transformations: The transformations applied to the objects seem to be based on logical rules, such as moving objects, resizing them, or changing their color. For instance, in Example_1, the objects are moved one position to the right, while in Example_2, they are resized to twice their original size.
* Noise pixels: There are also noise pixels scattered throughout the input sequences, which do not belong to any object. These pixels seem to be unaffected by the transformations.
* Arithmetic operations: The transformations involve arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, and counting the number of objects. For example, in Example_1, the objects are counted and sorted based on their size.
* Conditional rules: The transformations are conditioned upon certain criteria, such as the size of the objects or their position in the sequence. For instance, in Example_2, the objects are resized only if they have a size of 2 or more.

Based on these observations, I would infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a mapping of objects to other objects based on logical rules and arithmetical operations. Specifically, the input sequence is transformed into the output sequence by applying a series of transformations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and recoloring them. The noise pixels remain unchanged.

Now, let me apply this understanding to the given test case:

Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Object description:

* Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}
* Object_2: {color: 4, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 4}
* Object_3: {color: 4, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 4}
*... (omitted)

Transformed objects:

* Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}
* Object_2: {color: 4, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 4}
* Object_3: {color: 4, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 4}
*... (omitted)

Output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, the input sequence has been transformed into the output sequence by applying the same transformations as in the examples: moving objects, resizing them, and recoloring them. The noise pixels remain unchanged.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
