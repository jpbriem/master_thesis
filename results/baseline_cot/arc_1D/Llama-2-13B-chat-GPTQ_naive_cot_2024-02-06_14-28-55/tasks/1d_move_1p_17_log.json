The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions attached to these operations that determine when they should be applied.\n\nTo describe the transformation pattern, we can start by identifying the objects in the input sequence. In the given input sequence [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we can identify four objects:\n\nObject 1: [4, 4, 4, 4] (color: 4)\nObject 2: [0, 0, 0, 0] (color: 0)\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation pattern to each object based on its properties:\n\nObject 1:\n\n* Move: Since Object 1 has a fixed size of 4 pixels, we don't need to move it.\n* Scale: We can scale Object 1 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions, since it already covers the entire input sequence.\n* Remove: Since Object 2 has a size of 0 pixels, we can remove it completely.\n* Copy: We can copy Object 1 twice to fill the remaining gaps left by Object 2.\n\nHere's the updated object description:\n\nObject 1: [8, 8, 8, 8] (color: 4)\n\nObject 2: [] (color: 0)\n\nNow, let's apply the same transformation pattern to the output sequence:\n\nOutput:\n\n* Create a new object with the same properties as Object 1: [8, 8, 8, 8] (color: 4)\n\nOverall pattern:\n\nThe input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is based on applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions attached to these operations that determine when they should be applied.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Object description: Object 1: [4, 4, 4, 4]; Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Transformed objects: Object 1: [8, 8, 8, 8]; Object 2: []\n* Output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest output:\n\nnumpy.array([8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])"
