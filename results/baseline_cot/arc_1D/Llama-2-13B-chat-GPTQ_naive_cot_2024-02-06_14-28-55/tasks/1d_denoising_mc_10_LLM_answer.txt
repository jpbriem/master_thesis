You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:

* Objects: Each object in the input sequence has a specific size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of the same color) and position (represented by the starting index). Objects can be moved, resized, or removed.
* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be noise pixels (represented by the value 0), which do not belong to any object.
* Arithmetics: The transformation involves counting and sorting the objects based on their sizes and positions.
* Conditions: The transformation is conditioned on the properties of the objects, such as their size, position, and overlap.

Based on these patterns, I infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a mapping that takes each object in the input sequence and applies a series of transformations to it, based on its properties. These transformations may include moving, resizing, removing, or copying objects, as well as modifying their colors.

Now, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output. For the given test case input sequence:

[0, 5, 5, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I would perform the following steps:

1. Move the object at index 0 (value 5) one position to the right, since it is alone and has no overlapping objects.
2. Resize the object at index 1 (value 5) to size 2, since it overlaps with the object at index 2 (value 5).
3. Remove the object at index 3 (value 6), since it does not overlap with any other objects.
4. Copy the object at index 4 (value 5) to the gap left by the removed object at index 3.
5. Move the object at index 5 (value 5) two positions to the right, since it overlaps with the object at index 6 (value 5).
6. Resize the object at index 7 (value 5) to size 1, since it is the only object at that location.
7. Set the noise pixels at indices 8 and 9 to the color 2, since they are located in the gaps left by the removed objects.

After applying these transformations, the resulting test output sequence would be:

[0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Finally, here is the description of the overall pattern and instructions for the task:

Overall pattern: The input sequence consists of objects of various sizes and colors, with noise pixels and gaps between them. The transformation involves moving, resizing, removing, and copying objects based on their properties, such as size, position, and overlap.

Instructions: Given an input sequence, apply the above transformations to produce the corresponding output sequence. Pay attention to the size, position, and color of each object, as well as the presence of noise pixels and gaps. Use arithmetical operations and logical rules to determine the appropriate transformations.
