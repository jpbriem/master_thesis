The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of pixels, where each pixel has a value from 1 to 9 representing a specific color. The output sequence is also a sequence of pixels, but with some transformations applied to the original input sequence.\n\nFrom the examples given, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n* Objects in the input sequence are transformed according to certain rules, such as moving, resizing, changing color, or being removed.\n* The relationships between objects in the input and output sequences are important, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\n* Some objects may remain unchanged, while others may be modified or removed entirely.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to identify the key features of the input and output sequences and understand how they relate to each other. Here's my analysis of the three examples provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all pixels have the same value (1), so there are no objects to be transformed. However, the output sequence contains zeros at positions where the input sequence had ones, indicating that those pixels were removed. This suggests that the transformation involves removing pixels with a specific value (in this case, 1).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all pixels have the same value (3), so there are no objects to be transformed. However, the output sequence contains zeros at positions where the input sequence had threes, indicating that those pixels were replaced with zeros. This suggests that the transformation involves replacing pixels with a specific value (in this case, 3) with zeros.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all pixels have either the value 0 or 8, so there are two distinct objects to be transformed: objects with value 0 and objects with value 8. The output sequence contains zeros at positions where the input sequence had value 0, indicating that those pixels were removed. It also contains eights at positions where the input sequence had value 8, indicating that those pixels were retained. This suggests that the transformation involves removing objects with value 0 and retaining objects with value 8.\n\nBased on these observations, we can deduce the following general pattern for transforming the input sequence:\n\n* Objects with specific values (e.g., 1, 3, 8) will be transformed according to certain rules, such as moving, resizing, changing color, or being removed.\n* The relationships between objects in the input and output sequences are important, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\n* Some objects may remain unchanged, while others may be modified or removed entirely.\n\nNow, let me apply this understanding to the test case provided:\n\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, we can expect the output sequence to be transformed according to the same rules as the previous examples. Therefore, we can anticipate that objects with specific values (e.g., 2) will be transformed according to certain rules, such as moving, resizing, changing color, or being removed.\n\nHere's my prediction for the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has undergone the same transformation as the previous examples, with objects with value 2 being moved, resized, and changed color according to certain rules. The resulting output sequence preserves the same overall structure and relationships between objects as the input sequence, but with some modifications and removals applied according to the transformation pattern."
