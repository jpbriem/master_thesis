            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there may be conditions attached to these operations that determine whether they should be applied or not.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]`, here's my analysis of the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: `color = 9`, `start_index = 1`, `end_index = 4`, `size = 4` (four consecutive pixels of color 9)\n* Object 2: `color = 9`, `start_index = 5`, `end_index = 8`, `size = 4` (four consecutive pixels of color 9)\n* Object 3: `color = 0`, `start_index = 9`, `end_index = 10`, `size = 1` (one pixel of color 0)\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, we can infer that the desired output sequence will involve applying transformations to these objects. Specifically, we can expect the following changes to occur:\n\n* Object 1: Move to the right by one pixel (i.e., `end_index += 1`), keeping its size and color.\n* Object 2: Scale down by a factor of 2 (i.e., `size /= 2`), while maintaining its color and position.\n* Object 3: Change color to 6 (i.e., `color = 6`).\n\nWith these transformations in mind, here's the expected output sequence:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"...\",\n        \"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n        \"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n        \"transformation\": {\n            \"input\": \"[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\",\n            \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n            \"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n            \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\"\n        },\n        \"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n    }\n}\n```\nHere's the actual output sequence generated based on the above analysis:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input sequence\ninput_seq = [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\n\n# Transform objects according to the pattern observed in the examples\nobj1 = Object(color=9, start_index=1, end_index=4, size=4)\nobj2 = Object(color=9, start_index=5, end_index=8, size=4)\nobj3 = Object(color=0, start_index=9, end_index=10, size=1)\n\n# Apply transformations\nobj1.move_right()\nobj2.scale_down()\nobj3.change_color(6)\n\n# Create output sequence\noutput_seq = np.array([0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0])\n```\nNote that the `Object` class is not defined in this scope, so I've simply used the `numpy` array format to represent the output sequence."
