[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] and an output sequence [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0].

The transformation pattern here is quite simple: all objects (i.e., runs of consecutive pixels of the same color) are moved to the left by one position, and their size is doubled. This results in the creation of new objects where there were none before, and the enlargement of existing ones.

Example 2:
For this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0] and an output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0].

Here, the transformation pattern is similar to Example 1, but with one key difference: all objects are moved to the right by one position instead of the left. This creates new objects on the right side of the sequence and enlarges existing ones.

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] and an output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0].

The transformation pattern here is more complex than the previous two examples. All objects are scaled up by a factor of 5, except for one object at the beginning of the sequence which is scaled down by a factor of 5. Additionally, all objects are shifted to the right by one position, except for the first object which is shifted to the left by one position.

Now, let me analyze the test case you provided:

input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Based on the patterns observed in the previous examples, here's what I expect the output sequence to be:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

As expected, the input sequence remains unchanged, since no objects need to be moved, scaled, or recolored.

Overall Pattern:
Based on the three examples provided, the input-output relationship appears to involve a combination of object movement, scaling, and recoloring. Specifically, objects are either moved to the left or right by one position, scaled up or down by a factor of 5, or recolored. The specific transformation actions applied to each object depend on its initial position, size, and color.

Instructions:
To transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on consecutive pixels of the same color.
2. Apply the appropriate transformation action(s) to each object based on its initial position, size, and color.
3. Repeat steps 1-2 for all objects in the input sequence.

Transformation:
For the test case input sequence, apply the following transformation actions:

* Move all objects to the left by one position.
* Scale all objects up by a factor of 5.
* Recolor all objects to 1.

Output:
Create the resulting test output sequence using the transformation actions above. The output sequence should have the same length as the input sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
