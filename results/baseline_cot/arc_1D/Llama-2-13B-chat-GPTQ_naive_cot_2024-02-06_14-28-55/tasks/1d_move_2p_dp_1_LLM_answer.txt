[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0]

Example_3:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:

* Objects: The input and output sequences can be divided into smaller objects, represented by contiguous sequences of identical pixel colors. These objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, and changing color.
* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be considered noise and can be removed or replaced with a specific value (e.g., background color).
* Arithmetics: The objects can be manipulated using basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations can modify the size, position, and color of the objects.
* Conditions: The transformations can be conditioned upon certain criteria, such as the distance between objects, their alignment, overlapping, or containment.

Based on these patterns, I infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a series of transformations that manipulate the objects in the input sequence according to certain conditions. These transformations can include moving, resizing, rotating, and changing color, among others.

Now, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output. First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their properties, such as size, position, and color. We can then apply the appropriate transformations to each object based on the given conditions.

For example, if two objects are adjacent and have the same color, we can merge them into a single object of double the size. If an object is completely contained within another object, we can remove it. If an object has a certain distance from the starting point, we can move it by that distance. And so on.

Once we have applied all the necessary transformations, we can create the resulting output sequence. Here's the transformation function in JSON format:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
"Example_2": "..."
},
"overall_pattern": "Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
"instructions": "Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step",
"transformation": {
"input": "Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!",
"object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color",
"transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color",
"output": "Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!"
},
"test_output": "Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!"
}

And here's the test case input sequence:

[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0]

Applying the transformation function, we get the following output sequence:

[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do for you.
