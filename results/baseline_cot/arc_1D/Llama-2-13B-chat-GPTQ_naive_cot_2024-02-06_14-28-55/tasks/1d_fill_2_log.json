The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying the same operation to all objects of the same color. Specifically, if an object is of color `x`, then all instances of color `x` in the input sequence will be replaced with the value `5`. Additionally, any noise pixels (represented by the value `0`) in the input sequence will remain unchanged.\n\nTo apply this pattern to the given input sequence, we can start by identifying the objects in the input sequence. There are three objects in the input sequence, each consisting of a single pixel of color `0`, `3`, or `0` respectively. The objects are located at positions `0`, `3`, and `6` in the input sequence.\n\nNext, we need to determine how the objects should be transformed. Since all objects of the same color will be replaced with the value `5`, we can simply replace each object with the value `5` accordingly. This gives us the following transformed objects:\n\n* Object `0`: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n* Object `3`: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`\n* Object `6`: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFinally, we need to concatenate the transformed objects to create the final output sequence. This gives us the following output sequence:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"All objects of the same color were replaced with the value 5.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Replace all objects of the same color with the value 5, while leaving noise pixels unchanged.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Transform the input sequence by replacing all objects of the same color with the value 5, and leave noise pixels unchanged.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n        \"object_description\": \"Three objects of colors 0, 3, and 0 respectively.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"Objects of colors 0 and 3 replaced with the value 5, while the object of color 0 remains unchanged.\",\n        \"output\": \"[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
