[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there are noise pixels that need to be taken into account.

For the given input sequence `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]`, here's my analysis:

* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each consisting of a group of adjacent pixels with the same color. The objects are:
	+ Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 7, size: 6} (the first seven pixels)
	+ Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 14, size: 6} (the second seven pixels)
	+ Object_3: {color: 7, start_index: 15, end_index: 21, size: 6} (the third seven pixels)
	+ Object_4: {color: 7, start_index: 22, end_index: 28, size: 6} (the fourth seven pixels)
* Noise pixels: There are two noise pixels at indices 29 and 30 with value 0.

Now, let me describe the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:

Example_1:

* Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
* Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]

In this example, no transformations were applied, so the input and output sequences are the same.

Example_2:

* Input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the object at index 8 was moved to the beginning of the sequence, and all other objects were shifted accordingly.

Example_3:

* Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
* Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 0]

In this example, all objects had their color changed to 1.

Now, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform the given input sequence into its output sequence:

1. Move object at index 8 to the beginning of the sequence.
2. Change the color of all objects to 7.
3. Remove the noise pixels at indices 29 and 30.

Here's the resulting output sequence:

Output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
