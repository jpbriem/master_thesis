[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:

output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.

To begin, let me describe the input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, let me describe the objects in the input sequence:

Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 2}
Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 2}
Object_3: {color: 8, start_index: 9, end_index: 11, size: 2}

These objects are of color 8 and have sizes 2, 2, and 2, respectively. They are located at indices 1-3, 5-7, and 9-11, respectively.

Now, let me describe the transformation pattern:

The transformation pattern involves several operations, including moving objects, changing their color, and scaling them up or down. The pattern also involves adding noise pixels to the output sequence.

Based on these observations, here is my proposed transformation function:

def transform(input):
    # Move Object_1 to the left
    input[1] = 2
    input[2] = 0
    
    # Change Object_2's color to 3
    input[5] = 3
    
    # Scale Object_3 down by a factor of 2
    input[9] = 2
    input[10] = 2
    
    # Add noise pixel at index 4
    input[4] = 1
    
    return input

With this function, we can now apply the transformation to the input sequence:

input_transformed = transform([0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

And here is the resulting transformed sequence:

input_transformed: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As expected, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed according to the specified pattern. Object_1 has been moved to the left, Object_2's color has been changed to 3, and Object_3's size has been reduced by a factor of 2. Additionally, a noise pixel has been added at index 4.
