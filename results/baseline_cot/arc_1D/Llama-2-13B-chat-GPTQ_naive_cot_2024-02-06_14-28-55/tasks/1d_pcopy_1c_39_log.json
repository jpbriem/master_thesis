The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0]\n\nNow, let me describe the patterns I observe in these examples:\n\n* Objects appear to be transformed through various operations such as moving, resizing, rotating, and changing color.\n* Noise pixels seem to be added or removed randomly throughout the sequences.\n* Arithmetic operations such as counting and sorting may be applied to the objects.\n* Conditional rules may be used to determine the outcome of these operations.\n\nBased on these observations, I can infer that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern that involves object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations. However, without further information about the exact rules governing these transformations, I cannot provide a complete description of the pattern.\n\nAs for the test case input sequence you provided, here's my analysis:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI observe the following objects in this input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\n\nThese objects are transformed according to the pattern described above, which involves moving, resizing, and changing color. Specifically, Object 1 moves one position to the right, increases in size by 1 pixel, and changes color to 7; Object 2 moves three positions to the right, remains the same size, but also changes color to 7.\n\nNoise pixels are added or removed randomly throughout the sequence, and arithmetical operations such as counting and sorting may be applied to the objects. Conditional rules may also be used to determine the outcome of these operations.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence for this test case would be:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
