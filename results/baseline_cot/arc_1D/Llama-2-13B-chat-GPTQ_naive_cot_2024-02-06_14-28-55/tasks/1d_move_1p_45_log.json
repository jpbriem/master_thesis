            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of zeros and ones, where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. The output sequence consists of only zeros, indicating that all objects have been removed. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves removing objects if they are entirely contained within another object of the same color.\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of zeros and ones, where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. The output sequence consists of only ones, indicating that all objects have been copied and pasted elsewhere. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves copying and pasting objects if they are not entirely contained within another object of the same color.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of zeros and sixes, where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. The output sequence consists of only sixes, indicating that all objects have been scaled up to cover the entire input sequence. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves scaling objects based on their size and position in the input sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to objects in the input sequence, such as removal, copying, pasting, scaling, and possibly other arithmetical operations. These operations may be conditioned on certain rules or constraints, such as object size, position, and color.\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case you provided:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis input sequence consists of zeros and fives, where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, here's my interpretation of the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], starting at index 0 and ending at index 7, with a size of 8 pixels.\n* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], starting at index 8 and ending at index 9, with a size of 2 pixels.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform this input sequence into its output sequence:\n\n1. Remove Object 2, since it is entirely contained within Object 1.\n2. Scale Object 1 down to size 6, so that it ends at index 6 instead of index 7.\n3. Move Object 1 leftward by 2 pixels, so that it starts at index 2 instead of index 0.\n4. Copy Object 1 and paste it after Object 2, so that there are two instances of Object 1 in the output sequence.\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence consists of the original input sequence with some modifications to the objects based on the transformation pattern observed in the examples."
