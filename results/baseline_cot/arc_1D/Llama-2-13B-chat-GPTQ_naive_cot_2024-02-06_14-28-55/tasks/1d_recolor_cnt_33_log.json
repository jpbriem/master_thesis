The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, changing their size and color, and removing or adding objects. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that some objects (represented by the numbers 7 and 8) have moved positions, while others have changed size or color. Specifically:\n\n* Objects with value 7 have moved one position to the right.\n* Objects with value 8 have appeared at the beginning of the sequence and taken the place of the original object with value 7.\n* All objects have had their size increased by one.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that some objects have moved positions, while others have changed size or color. Specifically:\n\n* Objects with value 7 have moved two positions to the left.\n* Objects with value 8 have appeared at the beginning of the sequence and taken the place of the original objects with value 7.\n* All objects have had their size increased by one.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nIn this example, we can see that some objects have moved positions, while others have changed size or color. Specifically:\n\n* Objects with value 7 have moved one position to the right.\n* Objects with value 8 have appeared at the beginning of the sequence and taken the place of the original objects with value 7.\n* All objects have had their size increased by one.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving objects, changing their size and color, and removing or adding objects. To perform the transformation, we need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate operation based on its properties.\n\nNow, let me turn to the test case you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence, we need to follow the patterns observed in the examples above. Here's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, this output sequence has been transformed according to the patterns observed in the examples. In particular, objects with value 7 have moved one position to the right, while objects with value 8 have appeared at the beginning of the sequence and taken the place of the original objects with value 7. All objects have had their size increased by one."
