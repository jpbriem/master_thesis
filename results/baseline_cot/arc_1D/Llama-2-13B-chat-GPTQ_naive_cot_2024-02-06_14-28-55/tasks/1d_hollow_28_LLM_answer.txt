prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0] and an output sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]. From this example, we can see that the transformation involves moving objects (represented by non-zero values) to the left or right based on their color. Specifically, objects of the same color are moved together, and any remaining gaps are filled with zeros.

Example 2:
For this example, we have an input sequence [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and an output sequence [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, the transformation appears to involve scaling objects based on their color. Specifically, objects of the same color are scaled up or down by a factor of 3, while objects of other colors remain unchanged.

Example 3:
Here, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] and an output sequence [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]. This example shows that the transformation can also involve removing objects based on their color. Specifically, all objects with value 6 are removed from the input sequence, leaving behind only objects with value 0.

Now, let me analyze the test case input sequence [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, here's what I expect the output sequence to look like:

Output sequence: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To generate this output sequence, I would perform the following steps:

Step 1: Move any object of color 7 to the left or right based on its position and the color of adjacent objects.

Step 2: Scale any object of color 7 by a factor of 3.

Step 3: Remove any object of color 7.

After applying these steps, we should be left with the desired output sequence [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
