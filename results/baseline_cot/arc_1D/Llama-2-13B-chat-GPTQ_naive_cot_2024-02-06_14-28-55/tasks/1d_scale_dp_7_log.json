The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8]\noutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the information provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.\n\nFrom the examples given, we can observe that the transformation involves the following operations:\n\n* Moving objects horizontally by a fixed amount (e.g., moving object #1 to the right by 3 positions).\n* Scaling objects by a factor (e.g., scaling object #2 by 2).\n* Removing objects if they overlap with other objects (e.g., removing object #3 because it overlaps with object #1).\n* Copying objects if they do not overlap with other objects (e.g., copying object #2 because it does not overlap with any other object).\n* Changing the color of objects (e.g., changing the color of object #1 from 3 to 8).\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences. Specifically, we can represent the transformation as a set of rules that take the input sequence and produce the output sequence according to the following pattern:\n\n1. Find all objects in the input sequence.\n2. Apply the following operations to each object:\na. Move the object horizontally by a fixed amount (if necessary).\nb. Scale the object by a factor (if necessary).\nc. Remove the object if it overlaps with another object (if necessary).\nd. Copy the object if it does not overlap with another object (if necessary).\ne. Change the color of the object (if necessary).\n3. Replace any noise pixels in the output sequence with the appropriate color.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the test input sequence:\n\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nFirst, we find all objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject #1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\nObject #2: {color: 4, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\nObject #3: {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 1}\n\nNext, we apply the operations to each object:\n\nObject #1:\n\n* Move horizontally by 3 positions (to the right): {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3}\n\nObject #2:\n\n* Scale by 2: {color: 4, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 6}\n\nObject #3:\n\n* Remove because it overlaps with object #1: {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 1}\n\nFinally, we replace any noise pixels in the output sequence with the appropriate color:\n\noutput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8]\n\nTherefore, the test output sequence is [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
