The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence has a specific size (represented by a number) and a specific color (represented by a value from 0 to 9).\n* Adjacent objects of the same color are considered to be part of the same object, and their sizes and positions may be affected by the transformation.\n* The transformation involves moving, resizing, and recoloring objects, as well as adding noise pixels.\n\nWith these observations in mind, here is the description of the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs:\n\nOverall Pattern:\nThe input-output relationship for all input-output pairs involves applying a series of transformations to the input sequence, including moving, resizing, and recoloring objects, as well as adding noise pixels. These transformations result in a new output sequence that differs from the original input sequence.\n\nInstructions:\nTo transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their size and color.\n2. Apply the following transformations to each object:\na. Move the object to a new position based on its size and the positions of other objects.\nb. Resize the object to a specified size based on its current size and the positions of other objects.\nc. Recolor the object to a specified color based on its current color and the colors of other objects.\nd. Add noise pixels to the object based on its current size and position.\n3. Repeat the above steps for all objects in the input sequence.\n\nTransformation:\nThe transformation from input to output involves applying the following operations to each object in the input sequence:\n\n* Move: The object is moved to a new position based on its size and the positions of other objects.\n* Hollow: The object is resized to a specified size based on its current size and the positions of other objects.\n* Scale: The object is resized to a specified size based on its current size and the positions of other objects.\n* Remove: The object is removed if it is fully contained within another object.\n* Copy: The object is copied to a new position and resized based on its current size and the positions of other objects.\n* Recolor: The object is recolored to a specified color based on its current color and the colors of other objects.\n* Noise: Noise pixels are added to the object based on its current size and position.\n\nTest Output:\nGiven the input sequence [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the expected output sequence is [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps!
