[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:

* Objects: Each object in the input sequence has a specific size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of the same color) and position (represented by the starting index). Objects can be moved, resized, or removed.
* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be noise pixels (represented by the value 0), which do not belong to any object.
* Arithmetics: The transformation involves simple arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, and summing up the sizes of objects.
* Conditions: The transformation is conditioned upon the properties of the objects, such as their size, position, and overlap.

Based on these patterns, I infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a mapping that takes each object in the input sequence and applies a series of transformations to it, depending on its properties. These transformations may include moving the object to a different position, resizing it, or removing it altogether. The output sequence will consist of the transformed objects, along with any noise pixels that remain after the transformation.

Now, let me apply this understanding to the given test case:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

First, let's identify the objects in the input sequence:

Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}
Object 3: {color: 7, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 7}

Next, we need to apply the transformation rules to each object:

1. Object 1: Move one pixel to the right (start_index + 1). Size remains 2.
2. Object 2: Remove (end_index - start_index = 3).
3. Object 3: Resize to 8 (since there are no other objects overlapping with it).

After applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, the output sequence consists of the original input sequence with some modifications to the object positions and sizes. The noise pixels at the beginning and end of the sequence remain unchanged.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to perform additional tasks related to this problem.
