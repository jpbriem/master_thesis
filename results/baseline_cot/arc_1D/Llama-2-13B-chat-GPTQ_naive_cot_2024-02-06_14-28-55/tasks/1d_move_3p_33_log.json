The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of the three examples:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 12, containing two objects of color 2, one object of color 3, and five noise pixels (represented by 0). The output sequence has the same length and contains the same objects, but with some transformations applied:\n\n* Object 1 (color 2) has been moved to the beginning of the sequence and has doubled in size.\n* Object 2 (color 3) has been removed and replaced with six copies of object 1 (color 2).\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 8, containing six objects of color 6 and two noise pixels (represented by 0). The output sequence has the same length and contains the same objects, but with some transformations applied:\n\n* Each object of color 6 has been scaled up by a factor of 6.\n* Two additional objects of color 6 have been added to the end of the sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 4, containing one object of color 6 and three noise pixels (represented by 0). The output sequence has the same length and contains the same object, but with some transformations applied:\n\n* The object of color 6 has been moved to the beginning of the sequence and has doubled in size.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and duplicating objects. The specific operations applied seem to depend on the characteristics of the objects in the input sequence, such as their size, position, and color.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:\n\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns I've observed in the examples, here's my prediction for the output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The input sequence consists of nine objects of color 3, with no noise pixels.\n* Applying the transformation pattern observed in the examples, we can expect the objects to be moved, scaled, and possibly duplicated.\n* Since there are no noise pixels in the input sequence, it's likely that the output sequence will consist entirely of objects of color 3.\n* Based on the size of the objects in the input sequence, it's possible that they may be scaled up or down, but since they all have the same size (3), it's more likely that they will be scaled by a factor of 2 or 3.\n\nTherefore, my prediction for the output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]."
