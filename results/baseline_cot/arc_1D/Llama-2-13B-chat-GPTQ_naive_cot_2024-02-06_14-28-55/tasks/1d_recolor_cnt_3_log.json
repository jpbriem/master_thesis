The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:\n\n* Objects: Each object in the input sequence is represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color. Objects can move, change size, or be removed.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be noise (represented by the value 0) and do not belong to any object.\n* Arithmetics based on objects: The transformation involves counting and sorting objects based on their properties, such as size and position.\n* Conditions: The transformation is conditioned on the properties of the objects, such as whether they overlap or are aligned.\n\nBased on these patterns, I infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a mapping that transforms each object in the input sequence according to certain rules. These rules may include moving objects, resizing them, removing overlapping objects, and updating their colors based on conditions such as distance, alignment, and overlap.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform the test input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. We can start by identifying the largest objects first, which are the ones with the highest number of pixels. In this case, we have two large objects: one with the color 7 and another with the color 0.\n\nNext, we need to check for overlaps between objects. If two objects overlap, we need to merge them into a single object. For example, the object with the color 7 overlaps with the object with the color 0, so we need to merge them into a single object with the color 7.\n\nAfter merging objects, we need to update the colors of the remaining objects based on their positions relative to each other. For example, the object with the color 2 is located next to the object with the color 7, so we need to change its color to 7 to maintain continuity.\n\nFinally, we need to adjust the sizes of the objects based on their distances from each other. For example, the object with the color 5 is located far away from the other objects, so we need to increase its size to make it more visible.\n\nWith these transformation actions applied to the test input sequence, we get the following output sequence:\n\noutput = [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has undergone several changes compared to the input sequence. Objects have moved, resized, and had their colors updated based on the rules mentioned above.\n\nTo summarize, the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is based on the following patterns:\n\n* Objects: Movement, resizing, removal, and color updates based on conditions such as distance, alignment, and overlap.\n* Noise pixels: Removal.\n* Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n* Conditions: Rules based on object properties such as distance, alignment, and overlap.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
