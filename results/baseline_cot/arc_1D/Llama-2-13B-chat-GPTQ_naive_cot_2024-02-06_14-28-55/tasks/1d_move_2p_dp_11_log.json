The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence is a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (one of 0, 2, 3, or 5).\n* The output sequence is also a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color.\n* The transformation rule is as follows:\n\t+ If two adjacent pixels have the same color, they form an object.\n\t+ Objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, or changing color.\n\t+ Non-object pixels (i.e., pixels that are not part of an object) can change color randomly.\n\nBased on these rules, we need to transform the given input sequence into the corresponding output sequence. Let's analyze the input sequence first:\n\nInput sequence: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nHere, we see several groups of adjacent pixels with the same color (5):\n\n* Pixels [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] form one object.\n* Pixels [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] form another object.\n* Pixel [10] is a non-object pixel with color 0 (background color).\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation rules:\n\n1. Objects can move:\n\t+ Object [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] moves left by 2 positions, so it becomes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\n\t+ Object [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] moves right by 2 positions, so it becomes [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\n2. Objects can resize:\n\t+ Object [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] grows by 1 pixel to the left, so it becomes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].\n\t+ Object [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] shrinks by 1 pixel to the right, so it becomes [7, 8, 9, 10].\n3. Objects can rotate:\n\t+ Object [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] rotates clockwise by 90 degrees, so it becomes [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].\n\t+ Object [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] rotates counterclockwise by 90 degrees, so it becomes [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\n4. Non-object pixels can change color randomly:\n\t+ Pixel [10] changes color from 0 (background) to 3 (green).\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput sequence: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has undergone several transformations compared to the input sequence, including movement, resizing, rotation, and color changes. I hope this helps!"
