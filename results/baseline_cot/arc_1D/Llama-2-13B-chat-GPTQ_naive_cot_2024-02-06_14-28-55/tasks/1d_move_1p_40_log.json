The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects of the same color into a single object, while maintaining their relative positions and sizes. Additionally, any noise pixels (represented by the value 0) are removed from the output sequence.\n\nTo describe the transformation in more detail:\n\n* Objects of the same color are combined into a single object, with the largest object taking priority over smaller ones. This means that if two or more objects of the same color touch each other, they will merge into a single object.\n* If an object overlaps with another object of the same color, the overlapping portion of the smaller object will be removed.\n* Any noise pixels (0) in the input sequence will be removed from the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the given test input sequence:\n\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we'll identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject_2: {color: 2, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}\nObject_3: {color: 2, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}\nObject_4: {color: 2, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 2}\nObject_5: {color: 2, start_index: 9, end_index: 10, size: 2}\n\nNext, we'll apply the transformation rules:\n\n1. Combine objects of the same color into a single object:\n\t* Object_1 and Object_2 combine into a single object of size 4.\n\t* Object_3 and Object_4 combine into a single object of size 4.\n\t* Object_5 and Object_2 combine into a single object of size 4.\n2. Remove noise pixels (0):\n\t* All zero-valued pixels (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) are removed from the output sequence.\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence:\n\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has fewer objects than the input sequence, and the remaining objects are larger and better aligned. The noise pixels have been removed, leaving only the relevant information in the output sequence."
