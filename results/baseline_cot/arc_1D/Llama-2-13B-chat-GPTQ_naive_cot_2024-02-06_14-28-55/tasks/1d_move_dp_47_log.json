The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing the color of objects. Here's my analysis of the three examples:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 16, consisting of seven identical objects (color 7) followed by a single object of color 0. The output sequence has the same length, but the objects have been moved and resized. Specifically, each object has been moved one position to the right and has doubled in size, so that there are now two copies of each object. The lone object of color 0 has been removed.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have an input sequence of length 12, consisting of three identical objects (color 3) followed by eight zero-valued objects. The output sequence has the same length, but the objects have been shrunk to half their original size and have had their color changed to 0.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 10, consisting of four identical objects (color 4) followed by six zero-valued objects. The output sequence has the same length, but the objects have been moved to the left by one position and have had their color changed to 0.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some combination of the following operations to the input sequence:\n\n* Moving objects by one position to the right or left\n* Scaling objects by a factor of 2 or halving their size\n* Changing the color of objects to 0 or another value\n* Removing objects of color 0\n\nTo transform the test input sequence, I would need to apply these operations in the appropriate combinations to produce the desired output sequence. Here's the description of the transformation in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"....\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n\nAnd here's the actual transformation applied to the test input sequence:\n\n# Move all objects to the right by one position\nfor i in range(len(input)):\n    if input[i]!= 0:\n        output[i + 1] = input[i]\n\n# Double the size of all objects\nfor i in range(len(input)):\n    if input[i]!= 0:\n        output[i] *= 2\n\n# Change the color of all objects to 0\nfor i in range(len(input)):\n    if input[i]!= 0:\n        output[i] = 0\n\n# Remove any remaining objects of color 0\nfor i in range(len(input)):\n    if input[i] == 0:\n        output.pop(i)\n\nFinally, here's the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format:\n\narray([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0])"
