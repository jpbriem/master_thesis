The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]\n\nNow, let me describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on their size, position, and color:\n\nObject 1: {color: 9, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4} (representing four consecutive pixels of color 9)\nObject 2: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 3} (representing three consecutive pixels of color 9)\nObject 3: {color: 9, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1} (representing one pixel of color 9)\n\nNow, let me describe how these objects change in the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, here is my understanding of the transformation rules:\n\n1. Objects can move horizontally by up to half of their size.\n2. Objects can change size by up to double their original size.\n3. Pixels can become noise pixels (value 0).\n4. Arithmetic operations may occur between adjacent pixels of the same color, but only if they are not part of an object.\n\nUsing these rules, we can analyze the changes that occur between the input and output sequences:\n\n* Object 1 shrinks by half (from size 4 to size 2), moves left by one pixel position, and becomes noisy (pixel value changes from 9 to 0).\n* Object 2 grows by double (from size 3 to size 6), stays put, and remains unchanged.\n* Object 3 disappears (size 1 becomes 0).\n* Pixels between Objects 1 and 2 become noisy (pixel values change from 9 to 0).\n\nWith this understanding, we can now create the output sequence for the given input:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nFinally, here is the transformation description in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}"
