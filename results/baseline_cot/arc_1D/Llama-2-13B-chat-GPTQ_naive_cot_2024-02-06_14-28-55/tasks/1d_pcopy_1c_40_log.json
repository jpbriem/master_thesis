The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my understanding of the patterns and rules involved in the transformation:\n\n* Objects: The input sequence contains objects of different sizes and colors, represented by consecutive integers of the same color. These objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, and changing color.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be considered noise and are unaffected by the transformations.\n* Arithmetics based on objects: The transformations involve counting, sorting, and other arithmetical operations based on the objects' properties, such as their size, position, and color.\n* Conditions: The transformations are conditioned upon certain rules, such as the distance between objects, their alignment, and overlapping.\n\nNow, let me analyze the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom the input sequence, we can identify several objects of different sizes and colors:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8] (size: 3x3, color: 8)\n* Object 2: [0, 8, 8, 0] (size: 2x2, color: 8)\n* Object 3: [8, 0, 0, 0] (size: 1x1, color: 8)\n\nBased on the given examples, the transformation involves applying the following operations to these objects:\n\n* Move: Objects can move horizontally or vertically by a certain distance.\n* Resize: Objects can change their size by scaling up or down.\n* Rotate: Objects can rotate by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.\n* Change color: Objects can change their color.\n\nUsing these operations, we can generate the output sequence for the given test case. Here's my reasoning:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObject 1:\n\n* Move: Since object 1 is located at positions [0, 0, 8, 8, 8], we can move it rightward by 3 positions to [3, 0, 8, 8, 8].\n* Resize: We can resize object 1 to double its original size, so it becomes [6, 0, 16, 16, 16].\n* Rotate: Since object 1 is already aligned properly, no rotation is necessary.\n* Change color: We can change the color of object 1 to 2, so it becomes [6, 0, 16, 16, 16] (size: 3x3, color: 2).\n\nObject 2:\n\n* Move: Since object 2 is located at positions [0, 8, 8, 0], we can move it downward by 2 positions to [0, 8, 8, 2].\n* Resize: We can resize object 2 to half its original size, so it becomes [0, 4, 4, 2].\n* Rotate: Since object 2 is already aligned properly, no rotation is necessary.\n* Change color: We can change the color of object 2 to 3, so it becomes [0, 4, 4, 2] (size: 2x2, color: 3).\n\nObject 3:\n\n* Move: Since object 3 is located at positions [8, 0, 0, 0], we can move it leftward by 2 positions to [6, 0, 0, 0].\n* Resize: We can resize object 3 to half its original size, so it becomes [6, 0, 0, 0] (size: 1x1, color: 8).\n* Rotate: Since object 3 is already aligned properly, no rotation is necessary.\n* Change color: We can change the color of object 3 to 8, so it becomes [6, 0, 0, 0] (size: 1x1, color: 8).\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the final output sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps!
