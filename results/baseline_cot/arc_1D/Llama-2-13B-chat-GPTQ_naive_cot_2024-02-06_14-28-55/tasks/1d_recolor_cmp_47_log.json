The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 5, representing different colors, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some sort of pattern or rule.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* The input sequence consists of 16 pixels, each with a value from 0 to 5.\n* There are several groups of adjacent pixels with the same value (e.g., [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], etc.). These groups represent objects in the input sequence.\n* There are also some isolated pixels with values other than 0 or 5 (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]).\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* The output sequence consists of 16 pixels, each with a value from 0 to 8.\n* The output sequence has a similar structure to the input sequence, with groups of adjacent pixels having the same value.\n* However, there are some differences between the input and output sequences, such as the appearance of new objects (e.g., [8, 8, 8, 8]) and changes in the values of existing objects (e.g., [5, 5, 5, 5] becomes [8, 8, 8, 8]).\n\nBased on these observations, here's my inference of the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences:\n\nThe input sequence can be transformed into the output sequence by applying a set of logical rules that involve object movements, resizing, and color changes. Specifically, the rules seem to be as follows:\n\n1. Objects can move horizontally or vertically by one or two positions.\n2. Objects can change size by either doubling or halving their original size.\n3. Objects can change color by replacing their original color with a new color chosen from the set {0, 5, 8}.\n\nUsing these rules, we can transform the input sequence into the output sequence by applying the appropriate transformations to each object. For example, the object at position [1, 2] in the input sequence (with value 5) can be moved to position [2, 2] in the output sequence, resized to twice its original size, and changed to color 8. Similarly, the object at position [4, 4] in the input sequence (with value 5) can be moved to position [4, 6] in the output sequence, resized to half its original size, and changed to color 5.\n\nNow, let me provide the requested information in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, the main difference between the input and output sequences is the appearance of new objects and changes in object sizes and colors.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"Similarly, the second example shows significant changes in object sizes and colors, but no new objects appear.\",\n\"Overall_Pattern\": \"The input sequence can be transformed into the output sequence by applying a set of logical rules involving object movements, resizing, and color changes.\"\n},\n\"Instructions\": \"To transform a new input sequence, apply the appropriate transformations to each object in the input sequence based on the given rules.\",\n\"Transformation\": {\n\"Input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\",\n\"Object_Description\": \"Regarding the test input, there are 7 objects with the following properties:\",\n\"Transformed_Objects\": \"After applying the transformations, the objects in the output sequence have the following properties:\",\n\"Output\": \"[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]\"\n}\n}\n\nFinally, here's the test output sequence in numpy array format:\n\nnumpy.array([0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8])"
