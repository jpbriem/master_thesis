The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, where adjacent pixels of the same value represent objects. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a specific pattern of object transformations.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of pixels with values from 0 to 9.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same value represent objects.\n* The output sequence should be transformed from the input sequence using a specific pattern of object transformations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the objects in the input sequence. Based on the examples provided, we can see that there are several types of objects in the input sequence, including:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2} (represented by the color 2)\n* Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1} (represented by the color 3)\n\nThese objects have specific properties such as color, start index, end index, and size.\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation pattern for the input sequence. Based on the examples provided, we can see that the transformation pattern involves several operations, including:\n\n* Move: Objects can be moved to different positions in the output sequence.\n* Hollow: Objects can be made empty (i.e., their color is set to 0).\n* Scale: Objects can be resized to different sizes.\n* Remove: Objects can be removed entirely from the output sequence.\n* Copy: Objects can be copied to different positions in the output sequence.\n* Recolor: Objects can be given different colors.\n\nIn addition to these object transformations, there may also be noise pixels added to the output sequence. These noise pixels have random values between 0 and 9.\n\nFinally, here's my description of the test case input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, I would expect the output sequence to be transformed from the input sequence using the specified pattern of object transformations. Specifically, I would expect the following changes to occur in the output sequence:\n\n* Some objects may be moved to different positions.\n* Some objects may be resized to different sizes.\n* Some objects may be emptied (i.e., given color 0).\n* Some objects may be removed entirely.\n* Some objects may be duplicated.\n* Some objects may be given different colors.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more information."
