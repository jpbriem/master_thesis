You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.

To begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, let me analyze the objects in the input sequence:

Objects:

* Object_1: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
* Object_2: {color: 5, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}
* Object_3: {color: 5, start_index: 8, end_index: 10, size: 2}

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the objects in the input sequence can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, and changing color. Additionally, there may be noise pixels in the input sequence that do not belong to any objects.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the appropriate transformations to each object while taking into account their relationships and positions. Here's my analysis of the input sequence and the desired output sequence:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Comparing the input and output sequences, we can see that several changes have occurred:

1. Object_1 has moved one position to the right and grown in size from 2 to 6 pixels.
2. Object_2 has moved three positions to the right and grown in size from 3 to 6 pixels.
3. Object_3 has moved two positions to the left and shrunk in size from 5 to 2 pixels.
4. Some noise pixels have been removed.

To achieve this transformation, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Move Object_1 one position to the right (start_index: 1 -> end_index: 2).
2. Resize Object_1 from 2 to 6 pixels.
3. Move Object_2 three positions to the right (start_index: 4 -> end_index: 7).
4. Resize Object_2 from 3 to 6 pixels.
5. Move Object_3 two positions to the left (start_index: 8 -> end_index: 6).
6. Resize Object_3 from 5 to 2 pixels.
7. Remove noise pixels.

Here's the complete transformation in JSON format:

{
"description": {
"Object_1": {"size": 6, "position": 2},
"Object_2": {"size": 6, "position": 7},
"Object_3": {"size": 2, "position": 6}
},
"overall_pattern": "move and resize objects, remove noise pixels",
"instructions": "apply the following transformations to the input sequence: move Object_1 one position to the right, resize Object_1 from 2 to 6 pixels, move Object_2 three positions to the right, resize Object_2 from 3 to 6 pixels, move Object_3 two positions to the left, resize Object_3 from 5 to 2 pixels, remove noise pixels.",
"transformation": {
"input": "[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
"object_description": ["Object_1", "Object_2", "Object_3"],
"transformed_objects": ["Object_1: [2, 6]", "Object_2: [3, 6]", "Object_3: [2]"],
"output": "[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}
}

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any part of the solution.
