The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are some noise pixels that need to be taken into account.\n\nTo describe the transformation pattern, we can start by identifying the objects in the input sequence. In the given input sequence [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], we can identify the following objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 2, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}\n\nBased on the patterns seen in the examples, we can expect the following transformations to occur:\n\n* Object 1 will be moved to the right by 2 positions, so its new position will be 3-4.\n* Object 2 will be copied and pasted twice, once at the beginning of the sequence and once at the end, so it will appear three times in the output sequence.\n* All other pixels with value 2 will be replaced with value 0.\n* The single pixel with value 1 will remain unchanged.\n\nWith these observations, we can now describe the overall pattern of the transformation:\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n* Any object of color 2 will be moved to the right by 2 positions.\n* Any object of color 2 will be copied and pasted twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the sequence.\n* All other pixels with value 2 will be replaced with value 0.\n* The single pixel with value 1 will remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's apply this pattern to the given input sequence:\n\nInput Sequence: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nAfter applying the transformation pattern, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput Sequence: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nAs expected, Object 1 has been moved to the right by 2 positions, and Object 2 has been copied and pasted twice. All other pixels with value 2 have been replaced with value 0, and the single pixel with value 1 remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern can be described as follows:\n\nTransformation Pattern:\n\n* Move any object of color 2 to the right by 2 positions.\n* Copy any object of color 2 twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the sequence.\n* Replace all other pixels with value 2 with value 0.\n* Leave the single pixel with value 1 unchanged.\n\nI hope this helps!
