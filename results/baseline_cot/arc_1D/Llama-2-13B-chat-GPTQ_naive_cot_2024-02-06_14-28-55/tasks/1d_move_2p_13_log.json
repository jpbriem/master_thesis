The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color.\n\nFor Example_1, we can see that all objects are moved to the left by 7 positions, so the output sequence will have all objects shifted to the left by 7 positions.\n\nFor Example_2, we can see that all objects are resized to half their original size, so the output sequence will have all objects halved in size.\n\nFor Example_3, we can see that all objects are changed to color 0 (background color), so the output sequence will have all objects changed to the background color.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer that the transformation rule is applied recursively to each object in the input sequence, depending on the specific operation specified in the rule.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. We can see that there are several runs of consecutive identical pixels, which correspond to objects. In this case, we have the following objects:\n\n* Object_1: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n* Object_2: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n\nNext, we need to apply the transformation rule to each object. Based on the examples provided, we can see that the rule involves moving, resizing, and changing color. Let's apply these operations to each object in turn:\n\nObject_1:\n\n* Move: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (all objects moved to the left by 4 positions)\n* Resize: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (all objects resized to half their original size)\n* Change color: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (all objects changed to the background color)\n\nObject_2:\n\n* Move: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (all objects moved to the left by 4 positions)\n* Resize: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (all objects resized to half their original size)\n* Change color: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (all objects changed to the background color)\n\nTherefore, the test output sequence would be:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
