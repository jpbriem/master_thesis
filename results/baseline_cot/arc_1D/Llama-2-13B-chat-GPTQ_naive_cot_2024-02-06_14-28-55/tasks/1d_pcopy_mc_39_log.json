The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence has a specific size (represented by a number) and a specific color (represented by a value from 0 to 9).\n* Adjacent objects of the same color are considered to be part of the same object.\n* The output sequence contains the same objects as the input sequence, but with some transformations applied to them. These transformations include:\n\t+ Moving objects to different positions in the output sequence.\n\t+ Resizing objects to different sizes in the output sequence.\n\t+ Changing the color of objects in the output sequence.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer that the goal of the transformation is to rearrange and modify the objects in the input sequence to produce a new output sequence with different properties.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, let's identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\nObject 2: {color: 7, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\nObject 3: {color: 6, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 1}\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation rules to the input sequence:\n\n1. Move Object 1 to the beginning of the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, Object 1 has been moved to the beginning of the output sequence.\n\n1. Resize Object 2 to twice its original size:\n\nOutput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, Object 2 has been resized to twice its original size.\n\n1. Change the color of Object 3 to 8:\n\nOutput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, Object 3 has been assigned a new color (8) instead of its original color (6).\n\nAnd that's it! This is the transformed output sequence based on the given input sequence and the observed patterns."
