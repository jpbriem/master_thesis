The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing different pixel colors, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence according to some specific pattern.\n\nFrom the examples given, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n* Objects in the input sequence are identified by their color.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are grouped together to form objects.\n* Objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, changing color, or being removed.\n* The output sequence is constructed by applying these transformations to the input sequence.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine the appropriate transformations to apply to each object. We can represent the objects in the input sequence as a dictionary, where each key corresponds to an object and the value is a list of pixels belonging to that object.\n\nHere's an example of how we could represent the input sequence as a dictionary:\n```python\ninput_sequence = {\n    0: [0, 0, 0],\n    1: [5, 0, 0],\n    2: [0, 5, 0],\n    3: [0, 0, 5],\n    4: [0, 0, 0],\n    5: [5, 5, 5],\n    6: [0, 0, 0],\n    7: [0, 0, 0],\n    8: [0, 0, 0],\n    9: [0, 0, 0]\n}\n```\nNow, let's examine each example in turn and determine the appropriate transformations to apply to each object:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]`\n\nIn this example, we see three objects: two blue objects (colors 0 and 3) and one green object (color 2). The blue objects move horizontally to the right, while the green object moves vertically downward.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Object 0: Move horizontally right by 3 pixels.\n* Object 1: Move horizontally right by 3 pixels.\n* Object 2: Move vertically downward by 3 pixels.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]`\n\nIn this example, we see four objects: two red objects (colors 0 and 3), one yellow object (color 2), and one blue object (color 5). The red objects move horizontally left and right, while the yellow object moves vertically upward. The blue object remains stationary.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Object 0: Move horizontally left by 3 pixels.\n* Object 1: Move horizontally right by 3 pixels.\n* Object 2: Move vertically upward by 3 pixels.\n* Object 3: Remain stationary.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: `[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`\n\nIn this example, we see five objects: three red objects (colors 0, 2, and 8) and two blue objects (colors 3 and 5). The red objects move horizontally and vertically, while the blue objects remain stationary.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Object 0: Move horizontally left by 2 pixels and vertically upward by 3 pixels.\n* Object 1: Move horizontally right by 2 pixels and vertically upward by 3 pixels.\n* Object 2: Remain stationary.\n* Object 3: Remain stationary.\n* Object 4: Remain stationary.\n\nNow that we have determined the transformations for each object, we can create a function to apply these transformations to the input sequence:\n```python\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the objects\n    objects = {}\n\n    # Iterate over the input sequence\n    for i in range(len(input_sequence)):\n        # Check if the current pixel is part of an existing object\n        if i in objects:\n            # If so, add it to the existing object\n            objects[i].append(input_sequence[i])\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, create a new object\n            objects[i] = [input_sequence[i]]\n\n    # Apply transformations to each object\n    for obj in objects.values():\n        # Check if the object has moved or resized\n        if len(obj) > 1:\n            # If so, move or resize the object\n            for j in range(len(obj)):\n                input_sequence[obj[j][0]] = obj[j][1]\n\n    return input_sequence\n```\nFinally, we can apply the transformation function to the test input sequence:\n```python\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5]\n\n# Transform the input sequence\nresult = transform(test_input)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\nThe output should be:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n        \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n        \"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!
