The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of zeros and ones, where each run of consecutive ones represents an object. The output sequence simply removes any runs of zeros within these objects, leaving us with a sequence of only ones. In other words, if there are any zeros within an object, they are removed, and the remaining ones are kept together.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have an input sequence of ones and twos, where each run of consecutive ones or twos represents an object. The output sequence simply merges any adjacent objects of the same color (ones or twos) into a single object. So if we have two consecutive ones or two consecutive twos in the input sequence, they become a single object in the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of fives, where each five represents an object. The output sequence simply replaces each five with a zero, effectively removing all the objects from the input sequence.\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case you provided:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns I observed in the previous examples, here's what I would expect the output sequence to look like:\n\noutput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo summarize, the transformation pattern appears to involve combining objects in the input sequence based on their color and proximity to each other. Specifically, if two objects of the same color are adjacent to each other, they are combined into a single object in the output sequence. Additionally, any zeros within an object are removed, leaving only the non-zero elements of the object.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to perform additional tasks related to this one."
