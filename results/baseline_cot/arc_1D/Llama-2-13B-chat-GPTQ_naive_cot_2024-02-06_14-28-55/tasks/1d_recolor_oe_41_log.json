The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, let me describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on their size, position, and color:\n\nObjects:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 4} (representing four consecutive pixels of color 4)\n* Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 3} (representing three consecutive pixels of color 0)\n* Object_3: {color: 4, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 4} (representing four consecutive pixels of color 4)\n\nNext, I will describe how these objects change in the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, I infer that the transformation involves moving objects, resizing them, and changing their color. Specifically, Object_1 moves one position to the right and changes color from 4 to 7, while Object_2 disappears and is replaced by three new objects of color 3. Object_3 remains unchanged.\n\nNow, let me walk through the steps to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move Object_1 one position to the right (from index 1 to index 2).\n\nStep 2: Change the color of Object_1 from 4 to 7.\n\nStep 3: Remove Object_2 and create three new objects of color 3 at indices 6-8.\n\nStep 4: No other changes are made to the input sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation from input to output is as follows:\n\nInput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTransformation:\n\n[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
