            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and an output sequence [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The transformation appears to involve moving all objects of the same color together, so that adjacent pixels of the same color become part of the same object. In this case, we have five objects of color 5, each consisting of two pixels. After the transformation, these objects have been moved together, leaving behind a single object of color 5 with five pixels.\n\nExample 2:\nFor this example, the input sequence is [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0] and the output sequence is [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The transformation here seems to involve scaling objects based on their size. All objects of the same color are scaled up or down by a factor of three, depending on whether they have three or fewer pixels. As a result, the three objects of color 3 in the input sequence become one object of color 3 with nine pixels in the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, the input sequence is [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and the output sequence is [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The transformation here appears to involve removing any objects that have zero pixels. In the input sequence, there are no objects with zero pixels, so the output sequence remains unchanged.\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case you provided:\n\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, here's what I expect the transformation to do:\n\n* Move adjacent pixels of the same color together, just like in Example 1.\n* Scale objects based on their size, just like in Example 2.\n* Remove any objects with zero pixels, just like in Example 3.\n\nSo, here's my predicted output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo summarize, the overall pattern in these examples appears to involve manipulating objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The specific actions taken depend on the particular example, but generally involve moving objects together, scaling them up or down, and removing any objects with zero pixels."
