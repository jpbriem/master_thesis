            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some logical rules and patterns.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0\n\nBased on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves applying certain operations to the objects (pixels) in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color. The specific operations applied seem to depend on the distance between objects, their alignment, and other factors.\n\nTo perform the transformation, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine the appropriate operations to apply to each object. Here's my description of the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1:\n\n* Start index: 1\n* End index: 2\n* Size: 2\n* Color: 2\n\nObject 2:\n\n* Start index: 4\n* End index: 6\n* Size: 3\n* Color: 3\n\nObject 3:\n\n* Start index: 7\n* End index: 9\n* Size: 2\n* Color: 4\n\nNoise pixels:\n\n* Indexes: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\n* Colors: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output:\n\n1. Move Object 1 to the left by 1 pixel.\n2. Resize Object 2 to size 4.\n3. Change the color of Object 3 to 2.\n4. Remove noise pixels at indexes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.\n\nAfter these transformations, the input sequence would become the output sequence. Here's the resulting output sequence in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"....\",\n\"Overall_Pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"Instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"Transformation\": {\n\"Input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"Object_Description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Transformed_Objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n},\n\"test_output\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
