[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:

* The input sequence is a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (one of 0, 2, 3, 5, or 7).
* The output sequence is also a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color.
* The transformation rule is as follows:
	+ If the input pixel is 0, the output pixel remains 0.
	+ If the input pixel is 2, the output pixel becomes 3.
	+ If the input pixel is 3, the output pixel becomes 5.
	+ If the input pixel is 5, the output pixel becomes 7.
	+ If the input pixel is 7, the output pixel becomes 0.
	+ All other input pixels remain unchanged.

With this understanding, let's apply the transformation rule to the given input sequence:

input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

First, we'll iterate through the input sequence and apply the transformation rule to each pixel:

1. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Applying the transformation rule:

2. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]

As expected, the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and all pixels have been transformed according to the given rule.

Now, let me provide the requested information in JSON format:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "All pixels have been transformed to 0 or 8.",
"Example_2": "All pixels have been transformed to 0 or 8.",
"Example_3": "All pixels have been transformed to 0 or 8."
},
"overall_pattern": "All pixels have been transformed to 0 or 8.",
"instructions": "Transform the input sequence using the given transformation rule.",
"transformation": {
"input": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]",
"object_description": "Pixels with value 0 remain unchanged, while pixels with value 2 become 3, pixels with value 3 become 5, pixels with value 5 become 7, and pixels with value 7 become 0.",
"transformed_objects": "All pixels have been transformed to 0 or 8.",
"output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]"
},
"test_output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]"
}
