[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:

* Each object in the input sequence has a specific size (represented by a number of pixels) and a specific color (represented by a single digit).
* Adjacent objects of the same color are considered to be part of the same object, and they are transformed together.
* The transformation involves moving objects around, resizing them, and changing their color.
* Some objects may be removed or added to the output sequence.

With these observations in mind, here is the description of the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs:

Overall Pattern:

* The input sequence consists of a series of objects, each represented by a single digit (0-8).
* Each object has a specific size (represented by a number of pixels) and a specific color (represented by a single digit).
* Adjacent objects of the same color are considered to be part of the same object, and they are transformed together.
* The transformation involves moving objects around, resizing them, and changing their color.
* Some objects may be removed or added to the output sequence.

Example 1:

* Input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example 2:

* Input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
* Output: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Example 3:

* Input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Test Case:

* Input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, the transformation for the test case input sequence would be as follows:

Transformed Output Sequence: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
