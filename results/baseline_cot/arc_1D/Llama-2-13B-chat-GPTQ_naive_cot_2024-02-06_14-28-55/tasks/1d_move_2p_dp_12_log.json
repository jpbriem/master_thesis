The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 8, representing different colors. The output sequence is obtained by applying some kind of transformation to the input sequence.\n\nFrom the examples given, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n* Each object (i.e., a group of adjacent pixels with the same color) has a fixed size, which is determined by the length of the object's color value (e.g., objects with a value of 3 have a size of 3 pixels).\n* Objects can move horizontally, but their positions relative to each other remain unchanged.\n* Objects can change size, but their proportions remain the same.\n* New objects can be created by copying existing objects and changing their color.\n\nBased on these observations, I would suggest that the transformation from input to output is achieved through a combination of the following operations:\n\n1. Move: Pixels can be moved horizontally to create new objects or to adjust the position of existing ones.\n2. Copy: Existing objects can be copied to create new objects with the same size and position.\n3. Scale: Objects can be resized by scaling them up or down.\n4. Remove: Pixels can be removed to eliminate objects.\n5. Recolor: Objects can be given a new color.\n6. Alignment: Objects can be aligned to specific positions or sizes.\n7. Overlap: Objects can overlap each other, but their boundaries must align perfectly.\n8. Containment: Objects can be contained within larger objects.\n\nTo apply these operations, we need to carefully analyze each input sequence and determine which operations are necessary to transform it into the corresponding output sequence.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nAfter analyzing the input sequence, I believe the following operations are necessary to transform it into the corresponding output sequence:\n\n1. Move: Move the two pixels at index 2 and 3 to the left to create a new object with color 2.\n2. Copy: Copy the object at index 8 to create a new object with color 8 at index 4.\n3. Scale: Resize the object at index 8 to twice its original size.\n4. Remove: Remove the pixel at index 0 to eliminate the background color.\n5. Recolor: Change the color of the object at index 2 to color 3.\n6. Alignment: Align the object at index 4 to the right edge of the sequence.\n7. Overlap: Allow the objects at indexes 2 and 4 to overlap perfectly.\n8. Containment: Contain the object at index 2 within the larger object at index 4.\n\nHere is the resulting output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 2, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."
