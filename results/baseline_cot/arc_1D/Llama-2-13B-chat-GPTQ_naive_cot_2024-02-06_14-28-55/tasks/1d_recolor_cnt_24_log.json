The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing their color. The specific operations applied seem to depend on the object's size, position, and color.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the input sequence you provided:\n\n`[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nHere's how I would describe the objects in this input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: Start index 0, end index 2, size 2, color 2.\n* Object 2: Start index 3, end index 5, size 2, color 0.\n* Object 3: Start index 6, end index 7, size 1, color 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the desired output sequence. Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output sequence should consist of the original input objects, but possibly transformed in some way. Here's my best guess for the output sequence based on the given input:\n\n`[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]`\n\nHere's how I would describe the objects in the output sequence:\n\n* Object 1: Start index 0, end index 2, size 8, color 8.\n* Object 2: Start index 3, end index 5, size 8, color 9.\n* Object 3: Start index 6, end index 7, size 1, color 1.\n\nAs for the transformation itself, here's my analysis of the steps involved:\n\n1. Move object 1 to the left by 2 positions (start index 0, end index 2).\n2. Resize object 1 to size 8.\n3. Change the color of object 1 to 8.\n4. Remove object 2 (start index 3, end index 5).\n5. Move object 3 to the right by 1 position (start index 6, end index 7).\n6. Resize object 3 to size 1.\n7. Change the color of object 3 to 1.\n\nTherefore, the transformation from the input sequence `[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]` to the output sequence `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]` involves moving and resizing objects, as well as changing their color.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
