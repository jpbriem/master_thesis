            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color. The objects are:\n\t+ Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 4} (represented by the first four pixels)\n\t+ Object_2: {color: 4, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 4} (represented by the next four pixels)\n\t+ Object_3: {color: 4, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 4} (represented by the last four pixels)\n* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n* Transformation rules: Based on the examples provided, the transformation rules seem to involve moving objects, resizing them, and changing their color. Specifically, the rules suggest the following operations:\n\t+ Move objects: Objects can be moved by a certain distance (e.g., 1 pixel) in any direction.\n\t+ Resize objects: Objects can be resized by a certain amount (e.g., double their original size).\n\t+ Change object color: Objects can have their color changed to a different value (e.g., from 0 to 4).\n\nWith these rules in mind, let's apply them to the input sequence:\n\n* Object_1: Since Object_1 is the first object in the sequence, we can move it one pixel to the right (to index 5) and resize it to twice its original size (i.e., from 4 pixels to 8 pixels).\n* Object_2: Since Object_2 is the second object in the sequence, we can move it three pixels to the left (to index 2) and resize it to twice its original size (i.e., from 4 pixels to 8 pixels).\n* Object_3: Since Object_3 is the third object in the sequence, we can move it two pixels to the left (to index 7) and resize it to twice its original size (i.e., from 4 pixels to 8 pixels).\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has undergone several changes compared to the input sequence:\n\n* Objects have been moved and resized.\n* The color of some objects has been changed.\n* Noise pixels have been removed.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
