            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and copying them. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of several objects of different sizes and positions. The output sequence has the same objects, but they have been moved and scaled up. Specifically, object 2 has been moved to the beginning of the sequence and scaled up to twice its original size, while object 0 has been removed.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of several objects of the same size and position. The output sequence has the same objects, but they have been duplicated and aligned next to each other. Specifically, object 3 has been duplicated three times and placed next to itself.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a single object of size 2. The output sequence has the same object, but it has been duplicated several times. Specifically, the object has been duplicated five times and placed next to itself.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and copying them. The specific operations applied seem to depend on the size and position of the objects in the input sequence.\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case you provided:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom the input sequence, we can see that there are two objects of size 5, one at the beginning of the sequence and another at the end. There are also several zero-valued pixels scattered throughout the sequence.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into an output sequence, we need to apply the appropriate operations to the objects in the input sequence. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, here's what I would do:\n\n1. Move object 5 at the beginning of the sequence to the end of the sequence.\n2. Scale object 5 at the end of the sequence up to twice its original size.\n3. Remove all zero-valued pixels from the sequence.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n\nOutput: [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence consists of two objects of size 5, one at the beginning and one at the end, with no zero-valued pixels remaining. This transformation follows the pattern observed in the examples, where objects are moved and scaled up or down, and zero-valued pixels are removed."
