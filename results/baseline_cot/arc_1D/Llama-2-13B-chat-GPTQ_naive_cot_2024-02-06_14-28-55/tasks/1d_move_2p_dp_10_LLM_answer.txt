prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence of length 10 with three objects of color 6. The output sequence has the same length and contains only one object of color 6, which is the concatenation of all three objects in the input sequence. This suggests that the transformation involves combining objects of the same color when they are adjacent to each other.

Example 2:
In this example, we have an input sequence of length 10 with four objects of color 4. The output sequence has the same length and contains only one object of color 4, which is the concatenation of all four objects in the input sequence. Similarly, the object of color 9 at the end of the input sequence is removed. This suggests that the transformation involves removing any isolated objects of a given color and combining adjacent objects of the same color.

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence of length 12 with two objects of color 2. The output sequence has the same length and contains only one object of color 2, which is the concatenation of both objects in the input sequence. Additionally, the object of color 9 at the end of the input sequence is removed. This suggests that the transformation involves combining adjacent objects of the same color and removing any isolated objects.

Based on these patterns, I would suggest that the overall transformation pattern involves combining adjacent objects of the same color and removing any isolated objects. Specifically, if there are multiple objects of the same color next to each other in the input sequence, they will be combined into a single object in the output sequence. If there is only one object of a given color in the input sequence, it will be preserved in the output sequence. Isolated objects of a given color will be removed.

Now, let me apply this understanding to the test case you provided:

Input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the transformation pattern above, here's how I would transform this input sequence:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, I have simply combined all the objects of color 8 into a single object in the output sequence, while preserving the object of color 9 at the end of the sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
