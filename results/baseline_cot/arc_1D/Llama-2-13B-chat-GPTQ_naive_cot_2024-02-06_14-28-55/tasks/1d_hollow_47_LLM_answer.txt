[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we see three objects of color 3, located at positions 1-3 in the input sequence. The transformation changes the color of these objects to 0, effectively removing them from the sequence. This means that any object that has a value of 3 in the input sequence will be replaced with a value of 0 in the output sequence.

Example 2:
Here, we have two objects of color 3, one located at position 4 and another at position 6. The transformation moves the object at position 4 to the beginning of the sequence (position 0), and the object at position 6 is removed entirely. As a result, the output sequence contains only one object of color 3, located at position 0.

Example 3:
In this example, we have eight objects of color 8, all located at positions 1-8 in the input sequence. The transformation simply shifts all objects by one position to the left, so that the first object becomes the second object, the second object becomes the third object, and so on. This results in an output sequence where all objects are shifted one position to the left compared to the input sequence.

Now, let me analyze the test case you provided:

input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Based on the patterns seen in the examples, here's what I expect to happen in the transformation:

* Any object that has a value of 5 in the input sequence will be replaced with a value of 0 in the output sequence, just like in Example 1.
* The objects at positions 1-3 will be moved to the beginning of the sequence, just like in Example 2.
* The objects at positions 4-6 will be removed, just like in Example 2.

So, here's the expected output sequence:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To summarize, the key steps involved in transforming the input sequence are:

1. Replace any object with a value of 5 with a value of 0.
2. Move the objects at positions 1-3 to the beginning of the sequence.
3. Remove the objects at positions 4-6.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
