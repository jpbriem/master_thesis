You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions and noise pixels that affect the transformation.

To describe the transformation pattern, we can start by identifying the objects in the input sequence. In the given input sequence [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], we can identify several objects:

* Object 1: [8, 8, 8, 8] (size: 4x4, position: [0, 0, 0, 0])
* Object 2: [8, 0, 0, 0] (size: 2x2, position: [4, 0, 0, 0])

Now, let's apply the transformation pattern to these objects:

Object 1:

* Move: Since object 1 is already at position [0, 0, 0, 0], no movement is required.
* Scale: Since the size of object 1 is already 4x4, no scaling is required.
* Remove: None of the pixels in object 1 need to be removed.
* Copy: No copies of object 1 need to be made.
* Recolor: Since object 1 is already colored [8, 8, 8, 8], no recoloring is required.

Object 2:

* Move: Since object 2 is currently at position [4, 0, 0, 0], it needs to be moved to position [0, 0, 0, 0].
* Scale: Since the size of object 2 is 2x2, it needs to be scaled up to 4x4 to match the size of object 1.
* Remove: None of the pixels in object 2 need to be removed.
* Copy: No copies of object 2 need to be made.
* Recolor: Since object 2 is currently colored [8, 0, 0, 0], it needs to be recolored to [8, 8, 8, 8] to match the color of object 1.

With these transformations applied, the resulting output sequence would be:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, the main changes between the input and output sequences are the movement and scaling of object 2, and the recoloring of object 2 to match the color of object 1. All other pixels remain unchanged.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the steps involved in the transformation.
