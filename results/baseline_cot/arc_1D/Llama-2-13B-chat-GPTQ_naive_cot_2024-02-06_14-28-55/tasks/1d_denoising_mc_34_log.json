The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 7, 5, 8, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 1, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence is a list of integers representing pixel colors, where each integer value corresponds to a specific color (0 for background, 2 for object 1, 3 for object 2, etc.).\n* The output sequence is also a list of integers representing pixel colors, but with some modifications based on the input sequence.\n* The transformation rule is as follows:\n\t+ If an integer in the input sequence is equal to 0, then the corresponding integer in the output sequence will be set to 0.\n\t+ If an integer in the input sequence is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5, then the corresponding integer in the output sequence will be increased by 1.\n\t+ If an integer in the input sequence is greater than 5, then the corresponding integer in the output sequence will remain unchanged.\n\nWith this understanding, let's apply the transformation rule to the given input sequence:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we'll iterate through the input sequence and apply the transformation rule:\n\n1. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the transformation rule:\n\n1. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAfter applying the transformation rule, we get the output sequence:\n\noutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has undergone the specified transformation based on the input sequence.\n\nNow, let me provide the requested information in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"....\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
