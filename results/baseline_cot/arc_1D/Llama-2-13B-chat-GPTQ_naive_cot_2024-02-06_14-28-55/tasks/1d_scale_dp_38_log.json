            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects of the same color into larger objects, while also applying some sort of scaling or resizing effect. Additionally, there appears to be a rule about objects being separated by a certain distance, and any object that violates this rule will be removed.\n\nNow, let me analyze the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, we can see that there are seven objects of color 7, each with a size of 1. There is also one object of color 9 at the end of the sequence.\n\nTo begin the transformation, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. Based on the examples provided, an object is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color. In this case, we have seven objects of color 7, each with a size of 1, and one object of color 9 at the end.\n\nNext, we need to determine how these objects should be transformed into the output sequence. From the examples provided, it seems that objects of the same color are combined into larger objects, while any objects that violate the distance rule will be removed. Therefore, we can expect that the objects in the input sequence will be combined and resized accordingly.\n\nBased on these observations, here is my description of the transformation pattern:\n\nOverall pattern: Combine objects of the same color into larger objects, while removing any objects that violate the distance rule. Apply some sort of scaling or resizing effect to the combined objects.\n\nNow, let me apply this pattern to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we can combine the seven objects of color 7 into three larger objects, each with a size of 3:\n\nObject 1: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7]\nObject 2: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]\nObject 3: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]\n\nSince there are no objects of color 9 in the input sequence, we don't need to apply any scaling or resizing effects to the combined objects. However, we do need to check if any of the objects violate the distance rule. In this case, none of the objects violate the rule, so we can proceed with the transformation.\n\nTransformation:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the input sequence has been transformed into the output sequence according to the specified pattern. The objects of color 7 have been combined into larger objects, while any objects that violated the distance rule have been removed.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to perform additional transformations."
