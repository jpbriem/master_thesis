The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 6, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence is a list of integers representing pixel colors, where each integer value corresponds to a specific color (0 for background, 1-9 for different object colors).\n* Each object in the input sequence is represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color.\n* The output sequence is also a list of integers representing pixel colors, but with some modifications based on the object properties.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here's the transformation pattern I observe:\n\n* Objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, or changing color.\n* The relationships between objects can also change, such as overlapping or aligning with other objects.\n* Some objects may disappear or appear suddenly.\n\nTo solve this task, I will need to carefully analyze the input sequence and identify the objects present, their properties (size, position, color), and the desired transformations. Then, I will apply the appropriate transformations to produce the correct output sequence.\n\nHere's the description of the input and output sequences for the given test case:\n\nInput sequence:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 6, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObject description:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2} (color: blue, starting at index 1, ending at index 2, with a size of 2 pixels)\n* Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1} (color: red, starting at index 4, ending at index 4, with a size of 1 pixel)\n\nTransformed objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2} (unchanged)\n* Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1} (changed to color 3, starting at index 4, ending at index 4, with a size of 1 pixel)\n\nOutput sequence:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 6, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the input sequence contains two objects - an blue object starting at index 1 and ending at index 2, and a red object starting at index 4 and ending at index 4. In the output sequence, the blue object remains unchanged, while the red object changes to color 3 and shrinks to a single pixel.\n\nNow, please provide me with the actual test case input sequence, and I'll be happy to transform it into the corresponding output sequence according to the pattern observed."
