            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:\n\n* Moving objects (represented by non-zero values) to adjacent positions\n* Scaling objects down by a factor of 2\n* Removing any object that has a value of 0\n* Recoloring objects to 9 if they were previously 1, 2, or 3\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each operation:\n\n1. Moving objects to adjacent positions: Any object with a value of 1, 2, or 3 will be moved to the next position in the sequence. For example, the object at position 1 will be moved to position 2, the object at position 2 will be moved to position 3, and so on.\n2. Scaling objects down by a factor of 2: All objects will be reduced in size by half. This means that an object that was originally 2 pixels wide will become 1 pixel wide, and an object that was originally 3 pixels wide will become 1.5 pixels wide.\n3. Removing any object that has a value of 0: Any object with a value of 0 will be removed from the sequence entirely.\n4. Recoloring objects to 9 if they were previously 1, 2, or 3: Any object that was originally 1, 2, or 3 will be recolored to 9.\n\nBased on these operations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:\n\nTransformed output = Original input + (Original input - 1, 2, 3).scale(2).remainder(0).recolor(9)\n\nWhere \"+\" denotes concatenation, \"-\" denotes subtraction, \"scale\" applies the scaling operation, \"remainder\" removes any objects with a value of 0, and \"recolor\" recolors objects that were originally 1, 2, or 3 to 9.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation rule to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we'll subtract 1, 2, and 3 from the original input to get the transformed input:\n\nTransformed input = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - [1, 2, 3] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNext, we'll scale the transformed input by a factor of 2:\n\nTransformed input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] * 2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFinally, we'll apply the remaining operations:\n\nTransformed input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] + (1, 2, 3).scale(2).remainder(0).recolor(9) = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] + [1, 2, 3].scale(2).remainder(0).recolor(9) = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] + [1, 2, 3].scale(2).remainder(0).recolor(9) = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformed output for the given input sequence would be:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
