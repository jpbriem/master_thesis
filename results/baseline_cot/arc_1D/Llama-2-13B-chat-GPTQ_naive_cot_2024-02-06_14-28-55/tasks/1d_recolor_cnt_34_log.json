            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\noutput: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them up or down, changing their color, and removing or adding objects. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]\n\nIn this example, we can see that some objects (represented by the 2s) have moved horizontally, while others have been removed (the 0s). Additionally, some objects have been scaled up or down (e.g., the 2s become 9s), and their color has been changed (from blue to red).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, we can see that some objects have been added (the 2s become 7s), while others have been removed (the 0s). Additionally, some objects have been scaled up or down (e.g., the 2s become 6s), and their color has been changed (from blue to yellow).\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that some objects have been added (the 2s become 9s), while others have been removed (the 0s). Additionally, some objects have been scaled up or down (e.g., the 2s become 6s), and their color has been changed (from blue to green).\n\nBased on these patterns, I would suggest that the transformation pattern involves applying a series of operations to the input sequence, such as moving objects, scaling them up or down, changing their color, and removing or adding objects. These operations may be applied in a specific order or combination to produce the desired output sequence.\n\nNow, let me turn to the test case you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its output sequence, I would apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Move the object at index 2 to index 0, and change its color to 7.\n\nStep 2: Add an object at index 1 with color 2.\n\nStep 3: Scale the object at index 4 up by a factor of 2, and change its color to 9.\n\nStep 4: Remove the object at index 5.\n\nStep 5: Move the object at index 8 to index 6, and change its color to 6.\n\nStep 6: Add an object at index 9 with color 2.\n\nStep 7: Scale the object at index 10 up by a factor of 2, and change its color to 9.\n\nStep 8: Remove the object at index 11.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the resulting output sequence would be:\n\n[0, 7, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
