The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, I can see that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 8, representing different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example, [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with two objects: Object_1 (color 2) and Object_2 (color 3).\n* The output sequence is obtained by applying a set of transformations to the input sequence, including move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, and recolor.\n* The transformations are applied according to specific rules, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\n* Additionally, there may be noise pixels in the input sequence that need to be handled appropriately.\n\nTo solve this task, I will need to carefully analyze each example and identify the patterns and rules that govern the transformations between the input and output sequences. Here's my plan of action:\n\n1. Study each example closely and identify the objects in the input sequence, paying attention to their sizes, positions, and colors.\n2. Identify the transformations applied to each object in the input sequence, taking note of the rules governing these transformations (e.g., distance, alignment, overlap, containment).\n3. Develop a general understanding of the input-output relationship, focusing on the patterns and rules that govern the transformations.\n4. Use this understanding to create a JSON description of the task, including the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, test output, and any other relevant details.\n5. Implement the necessary transformations to convert a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n6. Test my solution on a variety of input sequences to ensure it is correct and efficient.\n\nHere's my initial assessment of the task based on the examples provided:\n\nDescription:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of two objects (Object_1 and Object_2), both of which are moved and resized.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of three objects (Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3), all of which are moved and resized.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of four objects (Object_1, Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4), all of which are moved and resized.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n* The input sequence is transformed according to specific rules, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\n* Objects may be moved, resized, or removed from the input sequence.\n* Noise pixels may also be present in the input sequence.\n\nInstructions:\n\n* Transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the specified rules and transformations.\n* Pay close attention to the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Input: A list of integers representing the input sequence.\n* Output: A list of integers representing the output sequence.\n\nTest Output:\n\n* A list of integers representing the expected output sequence.\n\nBased on the examples provided, I can see that the task requires careful analysis and attention to detail. I will need to develop a deep understanding of the input-output relationship and the transformations involved to produce the correct output sequence. I am confident that with diligent effort, I can successfully complete this task and provide the desired JSON description and test output."
