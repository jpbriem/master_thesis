The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 7, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some sort of pattern or rule.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0\n\nBased on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves moving objects (pixels) around, resizing them, and changing their color. The exact rules for the transformation are not explicitly stated, but we can infer some patterns based on the examples:\n\n1. Objects are moved horizontally and vertically: In Example 1, object 1 is moved 2 positions to the right, while object 2 is moved 4 positions to the left. In Example 2, object 1 is moved 4 positions down, while object 2 is moved 4 positions up.\n2. Objects are resized: In Example 1, object 1 is resized from 2x2 to 4x4, while object 2 is resized from 2x2 to 4x4. In Example 2, object 1 is resized from 2x2 to 4x4, while object 2 is resized from 2x2 to 4x4.\n3. Objects are colored differently: In Example 1, object 1 is colored blue (value 4), while object 2 is colored red (value 7). In Example 2, object 1 is colored green (value 6), while object 2 is colored yellow (value 7).\n\nWith these patterns in mind, let's analyze the test input sequence:\n\nTest Input Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7\n\nApplying the patterns we've observed, here's what we can do to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\n1. Move object 1 (values 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7) 2 positions to the right:\n\nNew position: 2, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7\n\n2. Resize object 1 from 2x2 to 4x4:\n\nNew size: 4, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7\n\n3. Color object 1 blue (value 4):\n\nNew value: 4, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7\n\n4. Move object 2 (values 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7) 4 positions down:\n\nNew position: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6\n\n5. Resize object 2 from 2x2 to 4x4:\n\nNew size: 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6\n\n6. Color object 2 green (value 6):\n\nNew value: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6\n\nAnd there we have it! Here's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
