The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nFrom the examples, we can see that the transformations involve moving objects (i.e., pixels) around, resizing them, changing their color, and removing or adding objects. The transformations seem to be governed by certain rules, such as the distance between objects, their alignment, and overlapping.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences. One way to do this is to examine the patterns and relationships between the input and output sequences for each example.\n\nFor Example_1, we can see that the input sequence consists of alternating bands of blue and red pixels, while the output sequence has these bands shifted horizontally and vertically, creating a checkerboard pattern. This suggests that the transformation involves moving objects horizontally and vertically.\n\nFor Example_2, the input sequence consists of a single long band of blue pixels, while the output sequence has this band broken up into smaller rectangular blocks of blue and green pixels. This suggests that the transformation involves resizing and recoloring objects.\n\nFor Example_3, the input sequence consists of a complex arrangement of blue, red, and green pixels, while the output sequence has these pixels rearranged into a simpler pattern of vertical stripes. This suggests that the transformation involves moving and resizing objects, as well as changing their color.\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is one of object movement, resizing, and color change. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve moving objects around, resizing them, and changing their color based on certain rules and conditions.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output. First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and size. We can then apply the following transformation rules:\n\n* Move objects horizontally and vertically based on their distance from other objects and their alignment.\n* Resize objects based on their size and the distance between them.\n* Change the color of objects based on their position and the colors of nearby objects.\n\nUsing these rules, we can create the resulting test output sequence. Here it is in numpy array format:\n\noutput = np.array([0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\nFinally, to summarize the transformation pattern, we can describe the overall pattern as involving object movement, resizing, and color change based on certain rules and conditions."
