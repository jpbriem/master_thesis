You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some logical rules and patterns.

Here's my analysis of the input and output sequences for each example:

Example 1:
Input: [2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of repeated values of 2 and 4, indicating that there are two objects of the same color (let's call it object A) and four objects of another color (object B). The output sequence simply duplicates the input sequence, but with each object of object A being replaced by two objects of the same color. This suggests that the transformation involves copying objects and scaling them up.

Example 2:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0]

In this example, the input sequence contains a single value of 1, indicating that there is one object of a specific color (let's call it object C). The output sequence replaces this object with five copies of the same color, suggesting that the transformation involves duplicating objects.

Example 3:
Input: [0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of a mix of values, including a single value of 3 and multiple values of 8. The output sequence replaces the value of 3 with eight copies of the same color, while leaving the other values unchanged. This suggests that the transformation involves replacing specific objects with copies of the same color.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation involves copying and scaling objects, as well as replacing specific objects with copies of the same color. To perform the transformation, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate operations to each object.

For the test case input sequence provided, here's what I would do:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color values. In this case, we can see that there is a single object of color 5, indicated by the value 5 in the input sequence.
2. Apply the appropriate operation to each object based on the transformation pattern observed in the examples. In this case, since we have a single object of color 5, we should duplicate it five times to create five copies of the same color.

Therefore, the transformed output sequence for the test case input sequence would be:

Output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the steps involved in the transformation.
