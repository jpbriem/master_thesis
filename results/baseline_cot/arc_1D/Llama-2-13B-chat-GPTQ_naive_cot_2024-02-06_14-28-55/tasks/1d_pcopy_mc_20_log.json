The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence has a specific size (represented by a number) and a specific color (represented by a value from 0 to 9).\n* Adjacent objects of the same color are considered to be part of the same object, and their sizes are added together.\n* If an object overlaps with another object of the same color, the smaller object is removed.\n* If an object completely contains another object of the same color, the contained object is removed.\n* Objects can also be moved or resized, but the overall shape and size of the object remains the same.\n\nUsing these rules, we can analyze the input and output sequences and determine the necessary transformations to convert one sequence into the other.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here are the steps to transform it into the corresponding output sequence:\n\n1. Object #1 (size 8, color 8): This object is already the maximum size allowed, so no changes need to be made.\n2. Object #2 (size 8, color 8): Since this object is also the maximum size allowed, no changes need to be made.\n3. Object #3 (size 5, color 0): This object needs to be moved to the beginning of the sequence, since it is the smallest object and should be placed first.\n4. Object #4 (size 0, color 0): This object should be removed, since it does not contribute any color or size to the sequence.\n5. Object #5 (size 0, color 0): This object should also be removed, since it does not contribute any color or size to the sequence.\n6. Object #6 (size 0, color 0): This object should be replaced with a new object of size 8 and color 8, since it is the largest object remaining in the sequence.\n7. Object #7 (size 0, color 0): This object should be replaced with a new object of size 8 and color 8, since it is the second-largest object remaining in the sequence.\n8. Object #8 (size 0, color 0): This object should be replaced with a new object of size 8 and color 8, since it is the third-largest object remaining in the sequence.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, the resulting output sequence would be:\n\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
