[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them up or down, and changing their color. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:

Example 1:
Input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

In this example, we can see that some objects (represented by the 2s) are moved to the right, while others (the 0s) remain unchanged. Additionally, some objects are scaled up (the 7s), while others are scaled down (the 1s).

Example 2:
Input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7]

Here, we can see that some objects (the 2s) are moved to the left, while others (the 0s) remain unchanged. Some objects are also scaled up (the 7s), while others are scaled down (the 1s).

Example 3:
Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, we can see that all objects are moved to the right, and some objects (the 2s) are scaled up (to 7s), while others (the 0s) remain unchanged.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving objects around, scaling them up or down, and sometimes changing their color. To perform the transformation, we need to carefully analyze each object in the input sequence and determine the appropriate action to take based on its properties.

Now, let me turn my attention to the test case input sequence you provided:

Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

To begin, I will describe the objects in the input sequence:

* Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
* Object 2: {color: 2, start_index: 3, end_index: 5, size: 3}
* Object 3: {color: 2, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}
* Object 4: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 11, size: 2}

Now, let me apply the transformation rules to the input sequence:

1. Move Object 1 one position to the right:
	* New position: 2
	* New size: 1
2. Scale Object 2 up by a factor of 3:
	* New size: 3
3. Move Object 3 two positions to the right:
	* New position: 4
	* New size: 2
4. Scale Object 4 up by a factor of 2:
	* New size: 4

After applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:

Output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

As you can see, the output sequence has undergone significant changes compared to the input sequence. Objects have been moved around, scaled up or down, and their color has been changed in some cases.
