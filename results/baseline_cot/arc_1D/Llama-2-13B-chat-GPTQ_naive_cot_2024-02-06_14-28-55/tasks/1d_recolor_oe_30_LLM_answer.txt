[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:

* Each object in the input sequence has a specific size (represented by a number) and a specific color (represented by a value from 0 to 8).
* Adjacent objects of the same color are considered to be part of the same object, and their sizes are added together.
* If an object overlaps with another object of the same color, the larger object absorbs the smaller one, and the size of the larger object increases by the size of the smaller object.
* If an object overlaps with another object of a different color, the object retains its original size and color.
* Noise pixels (represented by the value 0) may appear in the input sequence, and they do not affect the objects in any way.

Based on these rules, we can observe the following patterns in the input-output relationships:

* In Example 1, the objects are moved horizontally, and their sizes are adjusted accordingly.
* In Example 2, the objects are resized, but their positions remain unchanged.
* In Example 3, the objects are moved both horizontally and vertically, and their sizes are adjusted accordingly.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the given test case:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

First, let's identify the objects in the input sequence:

Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0] (size: 3) - color: 3
Object 2: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0] (size: 3) - color: 3
Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 0) - color: 0

Next, we need to apply the transformation rules to each object:

Object 1: Since Object 1 overlaps with Object 2, the larger Object 1 absorbs the smaller Object 2, and its size increases to 6.
Object 2: Since Object 2 overlaps with Object 1, it is absorbed by Object 1, and its size becomes 0.
Object 3: Since Object 3 does not overlap with any other object, its size remains 0.

Finally, we need to add noise pixels to the output sequence, if necessary:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Note that the output sequence contains more noise pixels than the input sequence, since we added noise pixels to the output sequence according to the rules specified in the task.
