The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 7, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some sort of logical rules or patterns.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* The input sequence consists of 16 pixels, each with a value from 0 to 7.\n* There are several groups of adjacent pixels with the same value (e.g., [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]).\n* These groups of adjacent pixels represent objects in the input sequence.\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* The output sequence also consists of 16 pixels, each with a value from 0 to 7.\n* The output sequence has undergone some transformation from the input sequence, with some pixels changing value and others remaining unchanged.\n\nBased on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves applying certain logical rules to the input sequence. For example, in Example_1, the input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0].\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the transformation involves replacing certain pixels with a new value (in this case, 9). Additionally, the transformation appears to respect the spatial relationships between pixels, as adjacent pixels with the same value are often replaced with the same new value.\n\nTo perform the transformation on a new input sequence, we need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and determine which pixels should be replaced with which new values. This may involve considering factors such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment between objects.\n\nHere's the JSON response for the given test case:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."
