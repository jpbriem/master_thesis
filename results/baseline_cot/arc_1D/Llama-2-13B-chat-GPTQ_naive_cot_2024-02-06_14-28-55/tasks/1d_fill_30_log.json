The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing different pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nFrom the examples, we can see that the transformations involve moving objects (represented by the integer values) around, resizing them, and changing their color. The transformations seem to be applied in a specific order, with the objects being moved first, then resized, and finally colored.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to identify the patterns and rules that govern the transformations between the input and output sequences. Here are some observations based on the examples:\n\n* Objects in the input sequence are moved horizontally by a fixed amount (i.e., all objects are moved by the same amount).\n* Objects in the input sequence are resized by a factor of 2 or 3.\n* Objects in the input sequence are changed to a new color based on their original color and the value of the object.\n\nBased on these observations, we can deduce the following rules for transforming the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\n1. Move all objects horizontally by 2 positions to the right.\n2. Double the size of all objects.\n3. Change the color of each object based on the following rules:\n\t* If the object has a value of 3, change its color to 2.\n\t* If the object has a value of 2, change its color to 1.\n\t* Otherwise (i.e., if the object has a value of 0 or 1), do nothing.\n\nWith these rules in mind, let's apply them to the given input sequence:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we move all objects horizontally by 2 positions to the right:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNext, we double the size of all objects:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFinally, we change the color of each object based on the rules above:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd there we have it! The transformed output sequence is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
