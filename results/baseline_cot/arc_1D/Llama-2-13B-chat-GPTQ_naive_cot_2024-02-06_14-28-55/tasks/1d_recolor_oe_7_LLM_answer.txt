[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing their color.

For the given input sequence `[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]`, here's my analysis:

* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color. The objects are:
	+ Object 1: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5] (color: 5)
	+ Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color: 0)
	+ Object 3: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] (color: 5)
* Relations between objects:
	+ Object 1 overlaps with Object 2 and Object 3.
	+ Object 2 has a gap between it and Object 3.
* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.
* Arithmetic operations: None.
* Conditional statements: None.

Based on these observations, I would infer that the desired transformation pattern is one that moves and scales objects, changes their color, and possibly applies other arithmetic operations.

To transform the input sequence, I would suggest the following steps:

1. Move Object 2 to the beginning of the sequence, so that it becomes Object 1.
2. Scale Object 1 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, so that it becomes twice as large.
3. Change the color of Object 1 from 5 to 3.
4. Move Object 3 to the end of the sequence, so that it becomes Object 2.
5. Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in the x direction, so that it becomes twice as wide.
6. Change the color of Object 2 from 5 to 9.
7. Add noise pixels to the sequence, with a probability of 0.5 for each pixel.

Here's the resulting output sequence:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Object_1": {"size": 2, "position": [1, 2], "color": 3},
        "Object_2": {"size": 2, "position": [8, 2], "color": 9},
        "Object_3": {"size": 2, "position": [4, 4], "color": 5}
    },
    "overall_pattern": "move, scale, change color, add noise",
    "instructions": "Transform the input sequence by moving Object 2 to the beginning, scaling Object 1 by 2, changing its color to 3, moving Object 3 to the end, scaling Object 2 by 2 in the x direction, changing its color to 9, and adding noise pixels with a probability of 0.5.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]",
        "object_description": ["Object 1: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]", "Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]", "Object 3: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]"],
        "transformed_objects": ["Object 1: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]", "Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]", "Object 3: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]"],
        "output": "[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]"
    }
}
```
