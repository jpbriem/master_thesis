The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some logical rules and patterns.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nBased on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves applying certain operations to the objects (pixels) in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. The specific operations applied seem to depend on the distance between objects, their alignment, and other factors.\n\nTo perform the transformation, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine the appropriate operations to apply to each object. Here's my description of the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObjects in Input Sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 7, size: 6} (representing a group of six consecutive pixels with value 7)\n* Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 12, size: 4} (representing a group of four consecutive pixels with value 7)\n* Object 3: {color: 9, start_index: 13, end_index: 18, size: 5} (representing a group of five consecutive pixels with value 9)\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation rules to the input sequence. Based on the examples provided, here are the steps to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move Object 1 one position to the right (from index 1 to index 2).\n\nStep 2: Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\n\nStep 3: Change the color of Object 3 to 7.\n\nStep 4: Move Object 3 two positions to the left (from index 13 to index 11).\n\nAfter applying these operations, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence is very similar to the input sequence, but with some changes to the object positions and colors. In particular, Object 1 has been moved one position to the right, Object 2 has been scaled up by a factor of 2, and Object 3 has been moved two positions to the left and had its color changed to 7. These changes result in a slightly different output sequence than the original input sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."
