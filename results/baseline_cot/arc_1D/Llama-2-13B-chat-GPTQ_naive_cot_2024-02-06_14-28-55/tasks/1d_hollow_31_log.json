The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nFrom the examples, we can see that the transformations involve moving objects (represented by non-zero values) around, resizing them, and changing their color. Additionally, there may be noise pixels added to the output sequence.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand the rules governing these transformations and apply them to the given input sequence. Here's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* The input sequence consists of 18 integers representing pixel colors.\n* There are four objects in the input sequence: two objects with color 4 (represented by the values 4 and 4), one object with color 0 (represented by the value 0), and one object with color 3 (represented by the value 3).\n* Each object has a specific size and position in the input sequence.\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* The output sequence will consist of the same number of integers as the input sequence.\n* The objects in the input sequence will be transformed according to the rules described above.\n* Some objects may be moved, resized, or changed in color.\n* Noise pixels may be added to the output sequence.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here are the rules I inferred for the transformation:\n\n1. Objects can move horizontally or vertically by up to 2 pixels.\n2. Objects can change size by up to 2 pixels in either direction.\n3. Objects can change color to any other color represented in the input sequence.\n4. Noise pixels can be added to the output sequence at random positions.\n\nNow, let me apply these rules to the given input sequence:\n\nInput Sequence: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\n1. Object 1 (color 4):\n\t* Move 2 pixels right, so new position is 2.\n\t* Size increases by 2 pixels, so new size is 6.\n2. Object 2 (color 0):\n\t* Move 2 pixels left, so new position is 0.\n\t* Size decreases by 2 pixels, so new size is 0.\n3. Object 3 (color 3):\n\t* Move 2 pixels down, so new position is 6.\n\t* Size increases by 2 pixels, so new size is 8.\n4. Add noise pixels:\n\t* Add 2 noise pixels at random positions in the output sequence.\n\nHere's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput Sequence: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nAs requested, I will provide the description of the transformation in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Object_1\": \"moved 2 pixels right, increased size by 2 pixels\",\n\"Object_2\": \"moved 2 pixels left, decreased size by 2 pixels\",\n\"Object_3\": \"moved 2 pixels down, increased size by 2 pixels\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"objects moved and resized, noise pixels added\",\n\"instructions\": \"apply the transformation rules to the input sequence\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"colors: 4, 0, 3; positions: 2, 0, 6; sizes: 6, 0, 8;\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"colors: 4, 0, 3; positions: 2, 0, 6; sizes: 6, 0, 8;\",\n\"output\": \"[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\"\n}"
