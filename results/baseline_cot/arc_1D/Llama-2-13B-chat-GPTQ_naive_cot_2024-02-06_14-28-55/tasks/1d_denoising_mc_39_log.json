The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a specific pattern of object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetics.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of pixels with values from 0 to 9.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n* The transformation pattern involves moving, scaling, removing, copying, and recoloring objects.\n* There may be noise pixels in the input sequence.\n* Arithmetic operations can be performed on objects, such as counting and sorting.\n* Conditional rules may apply to the transformations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, here's my interpretation of the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObjects in Input Sequence:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2} (represented by the two consecutive pixels with value 2)\n* Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1} (represented by the single pixel with value 3)\n* Object_3: {color: 2, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 3} (represented by the three consecutive pixels with value 2)\n\nNow, let me describe the desired transformation pattern for this input sequence:\n\nTransformation Pattern:\n\n* Move Object_1 horizontally by 2 positions to the right.\n* Scale Object_2 vertically by 2 times.\n* Remove Object_3 completely.\n* Copy Object_1 twice to create two new objects at indices 3 and 5.\n* Recolor all objects to color 1.\n\nUsing this transformation pattern, we can generate the expected output sequence as follows:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else you need assistance with."
