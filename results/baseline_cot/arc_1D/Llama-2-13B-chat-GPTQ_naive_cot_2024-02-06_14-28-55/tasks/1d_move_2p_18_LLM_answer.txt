[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of the three examples:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence of zeros with one non-zero value (7) at index 7. The output sequence has all zeros except for the last seven indices, which have the value 7. This suggests that the transformation involves copying the non-zero value at index 7 and appending it to the end of the output sequence.

Example 2:
Here, we have an input sequence of ones with one non-one value (0) at index 6. The output sequence has all ones except for the first six indices, which have the value 0. This indicates that the transformation involves replacing the single non-one value in the input sequence with a zero in the output sequence.

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence of fives with no non-five values. The output sequence has all fives, indicating that there is no transformation applied to the input sequence.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some operation(s) to the objects in the input sequence, but the specific operation(s) are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the operations involve modifying the values of the objects in the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence.

Now, let me analyze the given test case:

input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

From the input sequence, we can see that there are several runs of consecutive zeros, with a few non-zero values scattered throughout. To transform this input sequence into the corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the transformation pattern to each object in the input sequence.

Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - Since this object consists entirely of zeros, we don't need to apply any transformation to it. We can simply copy it verbatim into the output sequence.

Object 2: [4, 4, 4] - This object contains three non-zero values. Applying the transformation pattern, we replace the non-zero values with zeros, leaving us with [0, 0, 0].

Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - Like Object 1, this object consists entirely of zeros, so we don't need to apply any transformation to it. We can simply copy it verbatim into the output sequence.

Overall, the transformed output sequence would be: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4].

To summarize, the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. In this case, the operations involve replacing non-zero values with zeros to produce the corresponding output sequence.
