You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the input and output sequences:

* Objects: The input sequence contains objects of various sizes and colors, represented by consecutive integers of the same color. For example, the object at positions 1-2 has color 2, and the object at positions 4-4 has color 3.
* Transformations: The output sequence applies transformations to these objects, such as moving them, resizing them, changing their color, or removing them altogether. For example, the object at positions 1-2 in the input sequence is moved to positions 3-4 in the output sequence, and its size is increased from 2 to 3.
* Noise pixels: Some pixels in the output sequence have a value of 0, indicating that they are noise pixels and do not belong to any object. These noise pixels may be introduced during the transformation process or may represent missing data.
* Arithmetic operations: The output sequence includes arithmetic operations such as counting and sorting, which involve the objects in the input sequence. For example, the output sequence at position 1 may count the number of objects of a particular color in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, here's my proposed transformation function:
```python
def transform(input_seq):
    # Initialize empty output sequence
    output_seq = []
    
    # Iterate over input sequence
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        # Check if current pixel is a noise pixel
        if input_seq[i] == 0:
            # Add noise pixel to output sequence
            output_seq.append(0)
        else:
            # Find the object that the current pixel belongs to
            obj = find_object(input_seq, i)
            
            # Apply transformation to the object
            if obj is not None:
                # Move the object to the next position
                output_seq.append(obj.color)
                # Increase the size of the object by 1
                obj.size += 1
                # Remove the object from the input sequence
                input_seq.pop(i)
        
    return output_seq
```
This function takes an input sequence of integers representing pixel colors and returns an output sequence of integers representing the transformed pixel colors. It does this by iterating over the input sequence, checking each pixel to see if it is a noise pixel or belongs to an object. If it belongs to an object, the function applies a transformation to the object (such as moving it to the next position or increasing its size). Finally, the function adds the transformed object to the output sequence.

Now, let me apply this function to the test input sequence you provided:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
        "Example_2": "..."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
    "instructions": "describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!",
        "object_description": "regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color",
        "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color",
        "output": "create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!"
    },
    "test_output": "Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!"
}
```
Based on the input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the output sequence would be:
```json
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
