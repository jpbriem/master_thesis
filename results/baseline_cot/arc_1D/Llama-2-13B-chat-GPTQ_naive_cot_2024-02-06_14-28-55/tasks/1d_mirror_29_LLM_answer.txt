prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing their color.

For Example_1, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of objects of different sizes and positions, and the output sequence has these objects shifted and resized. Specifically, each object is moved one position to the right and scaled up by a factor of two.

For Example_2, the input sequence consists of a single large object at the beginning, followed by several smaller objects. In the output sequence, the large object is broken up into smaller copies of itself, each placed next to the original object.

For Example_3, the input sequence consists of a series of identical objects, and the output sequence simply duplicates each object once.

Based on these patterns, it appears that the desired transformation is a combination of object manipulation and arithmetical operations. To perform this transformation, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate operations to them.

Here's an outline of the steps we can follow to transform the test input sequence:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. This can be done by iterating over the sequence and checking for contiguous runs of the same color.
2. Apply the appropriate operations to each object, based on the pattern observed in the examples. For example, if the object is a single color, we may need to move it one position to the right and scale it up by a factor of two. If the object is composed of multiple colors, we may need to break it up into smaller copies of itself.
3. Output the transformed sequence.

Here's the code to implement this transformation:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_seq):
    # Identify the objects in the input sequence
    objects = []
    current_obj = None
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        if input_seq[i] == 0:
            continue
        if current_obj is None:
            current_obj = [i]
        else:
            current_obj.append(i)
        objects.append(current_obj)
        current_obj = None

    # Apply the appropriate operations to each object
    for obj in objects:
        # Move the object one position to the right
        obj.insert(0, obj[0])
        del obj[0]
        # Scale the object up by a factor of two
        for j in range(len(obj)):
            obj[j] *= 2

    return np.array(objects)

# Test the function with some sample inputs
print(transform([4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(transform([0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(transform([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
```
In the `transform` function, we first identify the objects in the input sequence by iterating over it and keeping track of the indices of consecutive elements of the same color. We then apply the appropriate operations to each object, moving it one position to the right and scaling it up by a factor of two. Finally, we return the transformed sequence as a NumPy array.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
