[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:

* Removing zero-valued pixels
* Moving pixels to adjacent positions
* Scaling pixels up or down
* Changing the color of pixels

Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which contains multiple instances of the color 3. After applying the transformation, we get the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0].

As we can see, the transformation has removed all zero-valued pixels, leaving only the non-zero pixels. Additionally, some pixels have been moved to adjacent positions (e.g., the two 3s in the middle of the sequence), while others have been scaled up or down (e.g., the single 3 at the beginning and end of the sequence). Finally, the color of one pixel (the 9) has been changed to match the color of another pixel (the 3s).

Example 2:
In this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which contains a single instance of the color 5. After applying the transformation, we get the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0].

As we can see, the transformation has removed all zero-valued pixels, leaving only the non-zero pixels. Additionally, some pixels have been moved to adjacent positions (e.g., the five 5s), while others have been scaled up or down (e.g., the single 5 at the beginning and end of the sequence). Finally, the color of one pixel (the 9) has been changed to match the color of another pixel (the 5s).

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which contains multiple instances of the color 4. After applying the transformation, we get the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0].

As we can see, the transformation has removed all zero-valued pixels, leaving only the non-zero pixels. Additionally, some pixels have been moved to adjacent positions (e.g., the four 4s), while others have been scaled up or down (e.g., the single 4 at the beginning and end of the sequence). Finally, the color of one pixel (the 9) has been changed to match the color of another pixel (the 4s).

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves removing zero-valued pixels, moving pixels to adjacent positions, scaling pixels up or down, and changing the color of pixels. To perform the transformation on a given input sequence, we need to apply these operations in a specific order, taking care to preserve the relationships between pixels (e.g., ensuring that pixels of the same color are adjacent to each other).

Now, let me turn my attention to the test case input sequence [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Here's the transformed output sequence:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As we can see, the transformation has removed all zero-valued pixels, leaving only the non-zero pixels. Additionally, some pixels have been moved to adjacent positions (e.g., the seven 7s), while others have been scaled up or down (e.g., the single 7 at the beginning and end of the sequence). Finally, the color of one pixel (the 9) has been changed to match the color of another pixel (the 7s).
