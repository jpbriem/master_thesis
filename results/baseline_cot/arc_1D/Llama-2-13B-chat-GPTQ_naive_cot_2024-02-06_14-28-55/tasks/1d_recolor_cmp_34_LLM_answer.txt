[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color. Additionally, there may be conditions attached to these operations that determine whether they are applied or not.

To begin, let's take a closer look at the input and output sequences you provided:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]

As we can see, the main differences between the input and output sequences are:

* Some objects (represented by the 6s) have been moved to different positions in the output sequence.
* Some objects have been resized (either larger or smaller).
* Some objects have had their color changed (from 6 to 8).

Now, let me walk you through the steps I would take to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, we have three objects: two large objects (represented by the two long sequences of 6s) and one small object (represented by the single 6 near the end of the sequence).

Step 2: Determine the operations that need to be performed on each object. Based on the examples provided, we know that some objects will need to be moved, resized, or have their color changed. We also know that some objects will not be affected by any operations.

For the first large object (the sequence of six 6s), we need to move it to the second position in the output sequence and resize it to twice its original size.

For the second large object (the other sequence of six 6s), we need to move it to the fourth position in the output sequence and resize it to half its original size.

For the small object (the single 6), we need to move it to the eighth position in the output sequence and change its color to 8.

Step 3: Apply the operations to the objects. Using the instructions provided, we can apply the necessary operations to the objects in the input sequence to produce the output sequence. Here's the resulting output sequence:

[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]

And there you have it! By carefully analyzing the patterns in the input and output sequences, we can deduce the necessary transformations to convert one into the other.
