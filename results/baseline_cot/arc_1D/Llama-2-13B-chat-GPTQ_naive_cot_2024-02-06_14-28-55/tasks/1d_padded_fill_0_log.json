The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence is assigned a unique color (0, 4, or 5) based on its position and size.\n* Objects of the same color are grouped together and their sizes are increased by a factor of 2 (except for objects at positions 1 and 8, which remain unchanged).\n* If two objects of the same color touch each other, they merge into a single object with twice the size.\n* Any object that overlaps with another object of the same color will be replaced by a copy of the other object.\n* All noise pixels (pixels with value 0) are removed.\n\nWith these rules in mind, we can now describe the transformation from input to output for each example:\n\nExample 1:\n\n* Input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]\n\nExample 2:\n\n* Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nExample 3:\n\n* Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nNow, let me explain how I would approach the task of transforming the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nFirst, I would start by identifying the objects in the input sequence based on their color and size. In this case, we have three types of objects: objects with color 0 (background), objects with color 4 (small object), and objects with color 5 (large object).\n\nNext, I would apply the rules described above to each object in the input sequence, taking into account their positions and sizes. Here are the steps I would follow:\n\n1. Check if any objects overlap with each other. If they do, replace the overlapping object with a copy of the other object.\n2. If an object touches the boundary of the image (i.e., position 1 or 8), leave it unchanged.\n3. Otherwise, increase the size of each object by a factor of 2, except for objects at positions 1 and 8.\n4. If two objects of the same color touch each other but do not overlap, merge them into a single object with twice the size.\n5. Remove any noise pixels (pixels with value 0).\n\nApplying these rules to the test input sequence, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
