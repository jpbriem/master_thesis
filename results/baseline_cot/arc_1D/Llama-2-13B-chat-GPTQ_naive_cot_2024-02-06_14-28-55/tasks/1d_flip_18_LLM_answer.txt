prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring. Additionally, there are noise pixels in the input sequence that need to be addressed.

For the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`, here's my analysis:

* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence: two small objects at positions 1 and 7, and one large object spanning positions 2-6.
* Transformations: To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following transformations to the objects:
	+ Move object at position 1 to position 3 (since the background color is 0).
	+ Scale object at position 7 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.
	+ Recolor object at position 2-6 to color 1.
* Noise pixels: There are several noise pixels in the input sequence, including the pixel at position 0. These pixels should be set to the background color (0) to avoid affecting the object transformations.

Based on these observations, the test output sequence for the given input sequence should be:
```json
{
"description": {
"Example_1": "the input and output sequences have the same number of objects, but the objects have been moved and resized",
"Example_2": "the input and output sequences have the same number of objects, but the objects have been rotated and recolored",
"overall_pattern": "the input and output sequences share the same underlying transformation pattern, involving moves, scales, and recolors"
},
"instructions": "apply the necessary transformations to the input sequence to produce the output sequence",
"transformation": {
"input": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]",
"object_description": "two small objects and one large object",
"transformed_objects": "one small object moved to position 3, one small object scaled by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, and one large object recolored to color 1",
"output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]"
},
"test_output": np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0])
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
