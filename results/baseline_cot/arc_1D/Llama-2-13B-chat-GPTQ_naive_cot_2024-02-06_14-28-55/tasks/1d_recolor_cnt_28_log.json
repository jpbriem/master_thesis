The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them up or down, and changing their color. Additionally, there may be some noise pixels added to the output sequence.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the input and output sequences for Example_1:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nFrom this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values from 0 to 1, representing different object colors. There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color 1 (represented by the values 1 and 2) and one object of color 0 (represented by the value 0). The output sequence has the same number of pixels, but with some changes to the object colors and positions.\n\nBased on this example, we can identify the following patterns in the transformation:\n\n* Objects are moved horizontally: The two objects of color 1 are moved to the right by one pixel each, while the object of color 0 remains stationary.\n* Objects are scaled up or down: The two objects of color 1 are scaled up by a factor of 2, while the object of color 0 is scaled down by a factor of 0.5.\n* New objects are introduced: A new object of color 4 is introduced at the end of the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's consider the test case input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the patterns identified above. Here's the step-by-step transformation process:\n\nStep 1: Move objects horizontally\n\n* Object 1 (value 1): Move right by 1 pixel.\n* Object 2 (value 2): Move right by 2 pixels.\n\nStep 2: Scale objects up or down\n\n* Object 1 (value 1): Scale up by a factor of 2.\n* Object 2 (value 2): Scale up by a factor of 2.\n* Object 3 (value 0): Scale down by a factor of 0.5.\n\nStep 3: Introduce new objects\n\n* Add a new object of color 4 at the end of the output sequence.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4]\n\nAs requested, I will provide the description of the objects in the input and output sequences, as well as the overall pattern of the transformation:\n\nObject description:\n\n* Input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\t+ Object 1 (value 1): Start index 1, end index 2, size 1.\n\t+ Object 2 (value 2): Start index 2, end index 3, size 1.\n\t+ Object 3 (value 0): Start index 3, end index 4, size 0.5.\n* Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4]\n\t+ Object 1 (value 1): Start index 1, end index 2, size 2.\n\t+ Object 2 (value 2): Start index 2, end index 3, size 2.\n\t+ Object 3 (value 0): Start index 3, end index 4, size 0.5.\n\t+ New object (value 4): Start index 4, end index 5, size 1.\n\nOverall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects horizontally, scaling them up or down, and introducing new objects. The objects are moved and scaled independently, and the new objects are introduced at the end of the output sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to perform additional tasks."
