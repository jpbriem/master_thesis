The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence has a specific color (0, 2, or 3) and a specific size (2 or 3 pixels long).\n* Objects of the same color are always touching each other, either horizontally or vertically.\n* If two objects of the same color are touching, they cannot be moved apart from each other.\n* Objects can be moved horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.\n* Objects can be resized, but their shape remains unchanged.\n* Noise pixels (value 0) may appear randomly throughout the sequence.\n\nBased on these rules, we can deduce the following transformation pattern:\n\n* Any object that is completely contained within another object of the same color will be removed.\n* Any object that overlaps with another object of the same color will be resized to fit entirely within the larger object.\n* Any noise pixels that are not part of an object will remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's apply this pattern to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: [0, 0, 0], color: 0\nObject 2: [2, 2, 2], color: 2\nObject 3: [2, 0, 2], color: 2\nObject 4: [0, 2, 2], color: 2\nObject 5: [0, 0, 0], color: 0\n\nNext, we need to apply the transformation rules to each object:\n\nObject 1: Since Object 1 is completely contained within Object 3, it will be removed.\nObject 2: Since Object 2 overlaps with Object 3, it will be resized to fit entirely within Object 3.\nObject 3: Since Object 3 contains both Objects 2 and 4, it will not be modified.\nObject 4: Since Object 4 is completely contained within Object 2, it will be removed.\nObject 5: Since Object 5 is not part of any object, it will remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's create the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence, except for the removal of Object 1 and the resizing of Object 2 to fit within Object 3.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."
