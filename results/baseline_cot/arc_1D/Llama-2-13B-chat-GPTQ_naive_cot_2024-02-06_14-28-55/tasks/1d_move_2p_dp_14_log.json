            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of objects (represented by the numbers 0 through 6) that are moved and resized. The output sequence shows the original objects, but with their positions shifted and sizes altered.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of objects (represented by the numbers 0 through 3) that are copied and repositioned. The output sequence shows the original objects, but with their positions shifted.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a single object (represented by the number 5) that is moved and resized. The output sequence shows the original object, but with its position shifted and size altered.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. The specific operations applied may depend on the specific input sequence and the desired output sequence.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, I will describe the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 8, start_index: 0, end_index: 8, size: 8}\n* Object 2: {color: 8, start_index: 9, end_index: 17, size: 8}\n* Object 3: {color: 8, start_index: 18, end_index: 26, size: 8}\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation actions needed to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\n1. Move object 1 to the left by 8 positions.\n2. Scale object 2 down by a factor of 2.\n3. Recolor object 3 to color 1.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0]\n\nAs requested, I will provide the description of the objects in the output sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 8, start_index: 0, end_index: 8, size: 8}\n* Object 2: {color: 8, start_index: 9, end_index: 17, size: 4}\n* Object 3: {color: 1, start_index: 18, end_index: 26, size: 8}\n\nFinally, I will provide the transformation instructions in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"......\",\n\"Overall_Pattern\": \"describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"Instructions\": \"describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"Transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"Object_Description\": \"regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Transformed_Objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Output\": \"create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"Test_Output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0]\"\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
