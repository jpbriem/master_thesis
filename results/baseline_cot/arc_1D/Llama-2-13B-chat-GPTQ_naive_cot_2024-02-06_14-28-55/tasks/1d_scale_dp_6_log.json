            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of the three examples:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we see two objects of color 2, one object of color 3, and one background pixel (color 0). The transformation simply copies the input sequence, so the output is the same as the input.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have four objects of color 5, each with a size of 5 pixels. The transformation moves each object one position to the right, effectively aligning them horizontally. Additionally, the background color changes from 0 to 6.\n\nExample 3:\nThis example features eight objects of color 8, each spanning the entire input sequence. The transformation does not change the size or position of any object, but instead replicates each object eight times, creating a repeating pattern.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some sort of operation to objects in the input sequence, possibly involving movement, scaling, or copying. However, without more information about the specific rules governing the transformation, it's difficult to determine exactly what those operations might be.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:\n\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, I will describe the input sequence:\n\n* There are nine pixels in total, with the first five pixels having value 5 and the remaining four pixels having value 0.\n* There is one background pixel with value 0.\n\nNext, I will describe the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 5, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 5}\n* Object 2: {color: 5, start_index: 5, end_index: 9, size: 5}\n\nFinally, I will describe the desired output sequence:\n\n* The output sequence should consist of the same number of pixels as the input sequence (i.e., 9 pixels).\n* Each object in the input sequence should retain its original size, position, and color.\n\nWith this information, I can now provide the requested information in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"No transformation was applied.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"Objects were moved horizontally by one position.\",\n\"Example_3\": \"Objects were duplicated.\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Apply some sort of operation to objects in the input sequence, possibly involving movement, scaling, or copying.\"\n},\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, thinking step by step.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0]\"\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
