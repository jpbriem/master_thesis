The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of repeated values of 2, indicating objects of the same color. The output sequence has moved some of these objects to different positions, and changed their color to 0. This suggests that the transformation involves moving and recoloring objects.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of repeated values of 8, indicating objects of the same color. The output sequence has moved some of these objects to different positions, but left others unchanged. This suggests that the transformation involves moving and aligning objects.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of repeated values of 7, indicating objects of the same color. The output sequence has removed some of these objects, leaving behind empty spaces. This suggests that the transformation involves removing objects.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, recoloring, aligning, and removing objects. To perform the transformation, we need to carefully analyze each object in the input sequence and determine the appropriate operation to apply.\n\nNow, let me turn to the test case you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, let's analyze the input sequence:\n\n* The first element is 0, indicating an empty space.\n* The next several elements (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) indicate objects of the same color.\n* The last two elements (0, 0) indicate more empty spaces.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the description of the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: A single object of color 1, located at index 1.\n* Objects 2-8: Eight objects of color 1, located at indices 2-9.\n* Object 9: An empty space indicated by the value 0.\n* Object 10: Another empty space indicated by the value 0.\n\nNow, let's determine the appropriate transformation actions to apply to the input sequence:\n\n1. Move object 1 to index 0, since there is already an empty space at that location.\n2. Remove object 9, since it indicates an empty space.\n3. Remove object 10, since it also indicates an empty space.\n4. Scale objects 2-8 by a factor of 2, since they are already aligned with each other.\n5. Recolor objects 2-8 to color 2, since they are now aligned with object 1.\n6. Align objects 2-8 with object 1, so that they form a continuous sequence of objects.\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence:\n\nOutput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has been transformed according to the patterns observed in the examples provided. Objects have been moved, scaled, recolored, and aligned to create a cohesive and visually appealing output sequence."
