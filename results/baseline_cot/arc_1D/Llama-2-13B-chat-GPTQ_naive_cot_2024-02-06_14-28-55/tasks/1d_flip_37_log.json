The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects, resizing them, and changing their color. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that some objects (represented by the numbers 7 and 8) have moved positions, while others have remained stationary. Additionally, some objects have been resized (e.g., the object at position 2 has grown from a size of 0 to a size of 7). Finally, one object (the number 8) has been replaced with a new object of a different color (blue).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, we can see that all objects have been resized to the same size (6), and their color has been changed from red to blue. Additionally, one object (the number 8) has been added to the sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that one object (the number 4) has been added to the sequence, and all objects have been resized to the same size (6). Their color has also been changed from red to blue.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving objects, resizing them, and changing their color. To perform the transformation, we need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and determine the appropriate action to take based on the pattern.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, let's analyze the input sequence:\n\n* The first five elements are all 0.\n* The next six elements are all 6.\n* The final two elements are both 5.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that there are three distinct groups of objects in the input sequence: the first five 0s, the six 6s, and the last two 5s. To transform this input sequence, we need to apply the transformation pattern to each group of objects separately.\n\nFor the first group of 0s, we can simply move them all to the left, so that they become the leading zeros of the output sequence. For the second group of 6s, we can resize them all to the same size (let's say 8), and change their color to blue. Finally, for the last two 5s, we can replace them with a single object of size 5 and color 5.\n\nWith these transformations applied, our test output sequence would look like this:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any part of the solution."
