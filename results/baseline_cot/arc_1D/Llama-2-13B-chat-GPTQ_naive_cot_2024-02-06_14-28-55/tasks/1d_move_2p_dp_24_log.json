The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 7, representing different colors, and the output sequence is obtained by applying some kind of transformation to the input.\n\nFrom the examples, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n* Each object (i.e., a group of adjacent pixels of the same color) has a fixed size, which is determined by the length of the object's color value (e.g., all objects with a value of 7 have a size of 7).\n* Objects can move horizontally, but their positions relative to each other remain unchanged.\n* Objects can change size, but their proportions remain the same.\n* New objects can be created by copying existing objects and changing their size.\n* Objects can be removed by setting their values to 0.\n\nBased on these observations, I would suggest the following transformation pattern:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and create a new output sequence.\n2. Iterate over the input sequence and perform the following operations:\na. If the current pixel value is 0, set the corresponding output pixel to 0.\nb. If the current pixel value is 7, set the corresponding output pixel to 3 (the background color).\nc. If the current pixel value is non-zero and non-7, increase the output pixel value by 1.\nd. If the current pixel is part of an object, move it horizontally by the amount specified in the object description.\n3. After iterating over the entire input sequence, the output sequence will represent the transformed version of the input.\n\nHere is the JSON response for the given test case:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, the difference between the input and output sequence is that the objects have moved horizontally, but their sizes and positions relative to each other remain unchanged.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"The input-output relationship is based on object transformations, including moving, resizing, and changing color.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Transform the input sequence by applying the above-described pattern to each pixel, taking into account the object descriptions.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Objects are defined by their color values: 0 - background, 7 - object.\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"After transformation, the objects will have the following properties: size, position, and color.\",\n\"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}"
