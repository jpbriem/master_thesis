            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:\n\n* Moving objects (represented by changes in position)\n* Resizing objects (represented by changes in size)\n* Changing object colors (represented by changes in color value)\n* Removing objects (represented by gaps in the sequence)\n\nAdditionally, there may be some noise pixels added to the output sequence.\n\nTo begin, let's analyze the first example:\n\nInput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of objects of different colors, with some noise pixels scattered throughout. The output sequence has undergone several transformations:\n\n* Objects have been moved: The blue objects at positions 1 and 3 have been moved to positions 6 and 8, respectively.\n* Objects have been resized: The red object at position 2 has been resized to twice its original size.\n* Objects have been colored differently: The green object at position 4 has been replaced with an orange object.\n* Noise pixels have been added: There are now noise pixels at positions 5 and 7.\n\nNow, let's consider the second example:\n\nInput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]\nOutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0]\n\nHere, we can see that the input sequence has undergone similar transformations as the first example:\n\n* Objects have been moved: The blue objects at positions 1 and 3 have been moved to positions 6 and 8, respectively.\n* Objects have been resized: The red object at position 2 has been resized to twice its original size.\n* Objects have been colored differently: The green object at position 4 has been replaced with an orange object.\n* Noise pixels have been added: There are now noise pixels at positions 5 and 7.\n\nFinally, let's examine the third example:\n\nInput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence has undergone fewer transformations than the previous two examples:\n\n* Objects have been moved: The blue object at position 1 has been moved to position 6.\n* Objects have been resized: The red object at position 2 has been resized to twice its original size.\n* Noise pixels have been added: There is now a noise pixel at position 5.\n\nBased on these observations, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving, resizing, and coloring objects, as well as adding noise pixels. To transform a new input sequence, we would need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformations based on their position, size, and color.\n\nNow, let me provide the requested information in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"....\",\n\"Overall_Pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"Instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"Transformation\": {\n\"Input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"Object_Description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Transformed_Objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"Test_Output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the points above."
