The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The output sequence is obtained by applying some kind of transformation to the input sequence.\n\nFrom the examples given, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n* Each object (i.e., a group of adjacent pixels of the same color) has a fixed size, which is determined by its width and height.\n* Objects can move, change size, or change color.\n* Objects can overlap or be aligned with each other.\n* Some objects may be removed or copied.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to identify the specific transformation rules that apply to each input sequence. Here's my analysis of the three examples provided:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we see two objects: one with the color 2 and the other with the color 3. The object with the color 2 moves horizontally by 2 positions, while the object with the color 3 changes size from 2x2 to 3x3. There is also a noise pixel at index 4, which remains unchanged.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have three objects: one with the color 5, one with the color 8, and one with the color 0. Object 1 moves vertically by 2 positions, while object 2 changes size from 2x2 to 3x3. Object 3 is removed and replaced with a new object of color 8, which is twice the size of the original object.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we see a single object with the color 7, which moves vertically by 2 positions and changes size from 2x2 to 3x3.\n\nBased on these examples, we can deduce the following general rules for transforming the input sequence:\n\n1. Objects can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed number of positions.\n2. Objects can change size, either increasing or decreasing their width and height by a fixed amount.\n3. Objects can change color, but only to a neighboring color (i.e., 2 becomes 3, 5 becomes 8).\n4. Noise pixels remain unchanged.\n\nNow let's analyze the test input sequence:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nThis input sequence consists of 10 zeros and one 8. Applying the transformation rules above, we get:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence, since there are no objects to move, resize, or change color.\n\nSo, to summarize, the input-output relationship for this task involves applying the following transformation rules to the input sequence:\n\n1. Objects can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed number of positions.\n2. Objects can change size, either increasing or decreasing their width and height by a fixed amount.\n3. Objects can change color, but only to a neighboring color.\n4. Noise pixels remain unchanged.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the points above."
