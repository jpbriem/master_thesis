The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence has a specific color (0, 5, or 3) and a specific size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of that color).\n* Objects of the same color are always touching each other, but they do not overlap.\n* If two objects of the same color are adjacent, they will be combined into a single object of double the size.\n* Any noise pixels (pixels with value 0) in the input sequence will be removed.\n\nUsing this understanding, we can now describe the transformation from the input to the output sequence. Here's the description of the transformation in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Objects of the same color are combined if they touch, and any noise pixels are removed.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"Objects of the same color are combined if they touch, and any noise pixels are removed.\",\n\"Example_3\": \"Objects of the same color are combined if they touch, and any noise pixels are removed.\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Combine objects of the same color if they touch, remove noise pixels\",\n\"instructions\": \"Transform the input sequence by combining objects of the same color if they touch, removing noise pixels, and adjusting the size of objects accordingly.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, there are three types of objects: 0, 5, and 3. Each object has a specific size, represented by the number of consecutive pixels of that color.\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"The transformed objects will have the following properties: \\n\\t* Color: either 0, 5, or 3\\n\\t* Size: double the size of the original object\\n\\t* Position: unchanged\",\n\"output\": \"[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\"\n}\n\nNow, let me apply this transformation to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n\nApplying the transformation, we get:\n\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence is obtained by applying the described transformation to the input sequence."
