            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:\n\n* Moving objects (represented by non-zero values) to the beginning of the sequence\n* Removing objects that are completely contained within other objects\n* Scaling objects down to size 1 if they are fully contained within another object\n* Setting unoccupied spaces (represented by zero values) to the background color (9)\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each operation:\n\n1. Moving objects to the beginning of the sequence: Any object that has a non-zero value will be moved to the beginning of the sequence, regardless of its original position. This means that any objects that were previously located at the end of the sequence will now be placed at the beginning.\n2. Removing completely contained objects: If an object is completely contained within another object (i.e., it has no unoccupied spaces), it will be removed from the sequence. This ensures that there are no redundant objects in the final output.\n3. Scaling down fully contained objects: If an object is fully contained within another object (i.e., it has no unoccupied spaces), it will be scaled down to size 1. This ensures that objects are not duplicated in the final output.\n4. Setting unoccupied spaces to the background color: Any unoccupied spaces (represented by zero values) in the input sequence will be set to the background color (9). This ensures that the final output has a consistent background color throughout.\n\nNow, let's apply these operations to the given input sequence:\n\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we'll move any non-zero values to the beginning of the sequence:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNext, we'll remove any objects that are completely contained within other objects:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThen, we'll scale down any objects that are fully contained within other objects to size 1:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFinally, we'll set any unoccupied spaces to the background color:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd there we have it! The transformed output sequence is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
