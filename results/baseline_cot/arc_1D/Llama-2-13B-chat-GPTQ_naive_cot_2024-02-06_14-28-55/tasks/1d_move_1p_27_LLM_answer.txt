[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there may be conditions or constraints that affect the application of these operations.

For the given input sequence `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis:

* Objects: There are five objects in the input sequence, each represented by a unique color (0, 7, 7, 7, and 0).
* Transformations:
	+ Move: None. All objects remain at their original positions.
	+ Scale: None. All objects retain their original sizes.
	+ Recolor: Objects 1, 2, and 3 change color to 2, 7, and 7, respectively. Objects 4 and 5 remain unchanged.
	+ Remove: None. All objects remain in the sequence.
	+ Copy: None. No objects are copied.
	+ Hollow: None. No objects are hollowed out.
* Noise pixels: None.
* Arithmetic operations: None.
* Conditions: None.

Based on the above analysis, the desired output sequence would be:
```json
{
"description": {
"Example_1": "All objects change color",
"Example_2": "Objects move and change color",
"Example_3": "Object disappears"
},
"overall_pattern": "Objects undergo transformations based on their color",
"instructions": "Identify objects by color and apply appropriate transformations",
"transformation": {
"input": "[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
"object_description": "Colored objects",
"transformed_objects": ["[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"],
"output": "[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
},
"test_output": "[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
