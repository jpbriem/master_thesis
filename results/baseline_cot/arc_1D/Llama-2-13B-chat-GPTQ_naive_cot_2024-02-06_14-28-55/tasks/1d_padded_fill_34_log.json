The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output pairs follow a similar pattern, where the objects in the input sequence are transformed in some way to produce the corresponding output sequence.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:\n\n* Example 1: In this example, the input sequence consists of alternating objects of color 0 (background) and color 5 (foreground). The output sequence has all objects of color 5, with no background objects remaining. This suggests that the transformation involves copying all foreground objects and discarding any background objects.\n* Example 2: In this example, the input sequence consists of alternating objects of color 0 (background) and color 7 (foreground). The output sequence has all objects of color 7, with no background objects remaining. This suggests that the transformation involves copying all foreground objects and discarding any background objects, just like in Example 1.\n* Example 3: In this example, the input sequence consists of a single object of color 2, followed by several objects of color 0 (background). The output sequence consists of multiple objects of color 2, with no background objects remaining. This suggests that the transformation involves copying any foreground objects and discarding any background objects.\n\nBased on these observations, I would suggest that the general pattern for the transformation is to copy all foreground objects and discard any background objects. This means that if an object is colored, it will remain in the output sequence unchanged, while any background objects will be removed.\n\nNow, let me apply this pattern to the given test case:\n\nInput: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the pattern above, we can see that there are two types of objects in the input sequence: foreground objects of color 7, and background objects of color 0. To produce the output sequence, we need to copy all foreground objects and discard any background objects.\n\nHere's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence contains only the foreground objects of color 7, with all background objects of color 0 removed."
