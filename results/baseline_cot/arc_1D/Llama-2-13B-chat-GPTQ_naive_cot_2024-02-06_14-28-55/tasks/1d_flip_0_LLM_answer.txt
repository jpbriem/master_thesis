[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some logical rules and patterns.

Here's my analysis of the input and output sequences for each example:

Example 1:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and ones, where the ones represent objects of a specific color (in this case, color 4). The output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with all zeros replaced by the object color (color 8). This suggests that the transformation involves copying objects from the input sequence to the output sequence, but replacing any zeros with the object color.

Example 2:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of a series of ones and threes, where the ones represent objects of a specific color (in this case, color 1) and the threes represent another object color (in this case, color 3). The output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with all ones replaced by color 3 and all threes replaced by color 1. This suggests that the transformation involves swapping the colors of two objects in the input sequence.

Example 3:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and sixes, where the sixes represent objects of a specific color (in this case, color 6). The output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with all zeros replaced by the object color (color 5). This suggests that the transformation involves copying objects from the input sequence to the output sequence, but replacing any zeros with the object color.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation involves copying objects from the input sequence to the output sequence, but replacing any zeros with the object color. Additionally, there may be some swapping of colors between objects in the input sequence.

Now, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output. First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color values. We can do this by iterating over the input sequence and checking if the current pixel value is non-zero. If it is non-zero, we know that we have found an object, so we record its starting index, ending index, and color value.

Once we have identified all the objects in the input sequence, we need to apply the transformation rules to each object. These rules may involve moving objects to different positions in the output sequence, changing their sizes, or modifying their colors. We can apply these rules by iterating over the objects in the input sequence and applying the appropriate transformations to each one.

Finally, once we have applied all the necessary transformations to the input sequence, we can create the resulting output sequence by simply copying the transformed objects from the input sequence to the output sequence.

Here's the code to implement this transformation:
```python
def transform(input_sequence):
    # Identify objects in the input sequence
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(input_sequence)):
        if input_sequence[i]!= 0:
            objects.append({
                "start": i,
                "end": i + 1,
                "color": input_sequence[i]
            })
    
    # Apply transformation rules to each object
    for obj in objects:
        # Move object to a different position in the output sequence
        if len(obj["start"]) > 1:
            obj["start"] -= 1
        # Change object size
        elif len(obj["end"]) - len(obj["start"]) > 1:
            obj["end"] += 1
        # Modify object color
        else:
            obj["color"] += 2
    
    # Create the output sequence
    output_sequence = [0] * len(input_sequence)
    for obj in objects:
        output_sequence[obj["start"]] = obj["color"]
        output_sequence[obj["end"]] = obj["color"]
    
    return output_sequence
```
And here's the test output sequence:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
        "Example_2": "..."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
    "instructions": "Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!",
        "object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color",
        "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color",
        "output": "Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!"
    },
    "test_output": "[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]"
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
