The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects (or pixels) around, resizing them, and changing their color. The noise pixels also seem to play a role in the transformation.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I observe:\n\n* There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color `2` and one object of color `0`.\n* The objects are of varying sizes, with the largest object being the two `2`s in the middle of the sequence.\n* The noise pixels are all `0`s, indicating no noise in the sequence.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Move the two small `2`s towards the center of the sequence, so that they become part of the larger `2` object. This creates a single object of color `2` with a size of `4`.\n2. Resize the large `2` object to twice its original size, so that it becomes `4` pixels wide.\n3. Change the color of the remaining `0` pixels to `2`, so that the entire sequence has the same color scheme.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nIn JSON format, the description of the transformation would be:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"moving objects towards the center and resizing\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"same transformation pattern\",\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"moving and resizing objects, changing color\"\n  },\n  \"instructions\": \"move objects towards the center, resize, change color\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": \"two small 2s and one large 2\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"one large 2\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n  },\n  \"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
