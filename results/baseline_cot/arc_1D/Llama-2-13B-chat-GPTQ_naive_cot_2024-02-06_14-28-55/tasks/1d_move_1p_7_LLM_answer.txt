[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the information provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.

From the examples given, we can observe that the transformation involves moving objects, changing their size, and modifying their color. Additionally, there seem to be rules regarding the placement of objects and the handling of noise pixels.

To begin, let's take a closer look at the input sequence:

input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the patterns seen in the examples, we can identify several objects in the input sequence:

* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 1}

Now, let's consider the desired output sequence. Based on the examples, we know that the output sequence will consist of the original objects, but possibly moved, resized, or modified in some way.

Here's one possible approach to generating the output sequence:

1. Move Object 1 to the beginning of the sequence (start index 0):

output: [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

1. Resize Object 2 to size 2:

output: [4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

1. Change the color of Object 2 to 3:

output: [4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

And so on. We can continue applying these transformations to the input sequence until we reach the desired output sequence.

Overall pattern:

The input sequence consists of objects, noise pixels, and arithmetics. The transformation involves moving, resizing, and modifying objects, as well as applying conditions to determine the final output.

Instructions:

To transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.
2. Apply the necessary transformations to each object, taking into account the rules of the pattern.
3. Output the resulting transformed sequence.

Transformation:

Input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Object description:

* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 1}

Transformed objects:

* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, size: 2}
* Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 1}

Output: [4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
