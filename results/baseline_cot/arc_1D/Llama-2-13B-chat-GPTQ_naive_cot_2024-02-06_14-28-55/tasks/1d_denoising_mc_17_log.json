The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 3, 4, 3, 8, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence is a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (one of 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9).\n* Each object in the input sequence is defined by a set of pixels with the same color. For example, in Example_1, there are two objects: one consisting of pixels with color 2, and another consisting of pixels with color 3.\n* The output sequence is also a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color.\n* The transformation rule is as follows:\n\t+ If an object in the input sequence has a certain color, then the corresponding pixel in the output sequence will have the same color.\n\t+ If an object in the input sequence does not have any pixels with a certain color, then the corresponding pixel in the output sequence will have the background color (0).\n\nBased on these rules, we can determine the transformation for each object in the input sequence. For example, in Example_1, the first object consists of pixels with color 2, so all pixels with color 2 in the input sequence will be retained in the output sequence with the same color. The second object consists of pixels with color 3, so all pixels with color 3 in the input sequence will be retained in the output sequence with the same color. Pixels without any objects (i.e., background pixels) will be set to color 0.\n\nNow, let me apply this transformation to the given test input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAfter applying the transformation rule, here's the resulting output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence, since no objects were moved, resized, or removed. However, some pixels were assigned the background color (0) because they did not belong to any objects.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you need assistance with other tasks."
