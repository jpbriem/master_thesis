You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
The input sequence consists of two objects of color 2, one object of color 0, and three objects of color 2. The output sequence has two objects of color 2, but the second object has been moved to the beginning of the sequence, and the third object has been removed. This transformation can be described as "move the second object to the beginning" and "remove the third object".

Example 2:
The input sequence consists of four objects of color 4, and no objects of any other color. The output sequence has four objects of color 4, but the objects have been resized to half their original size. This transformation can be described as "scale down the objects by half".

Example 3:
The input sequence consists of seven objects of color 7, and no objects of any other color. The output sequence has seven objects of color 7, but the objects have been rotated by 90 degrees clockwise. This transformation can be described as "rotate the objects by 90 degrees clockwise".

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, rotating, removing, or copying objects. These operations may be conditionally applied based on certain criteria, such as the distance between objects or the color of the objects.

Now, let me analyze the test case you provided:

input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

This input sequence consists of nine objects of color 3, with no objects of any other color.

To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the transformation pattern described above. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving, scaling, and removing objects.

Here's my proposed transformation for the test case:

1. Move the first object of color 3 to the beginning of the sequence (i.e., index 0).
2. Scale the second and third objects of color 3 by half (i.e., reduce their size by half).
3. Remove the fourth object of color 3.
4. Rotate the remaining objects of color 3 by 90 degrees clockwise.

After applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]

As you can see, the output sequence has the same number of objects as the input sequence, but the objects have been transformed according to the patterns described above.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you.
