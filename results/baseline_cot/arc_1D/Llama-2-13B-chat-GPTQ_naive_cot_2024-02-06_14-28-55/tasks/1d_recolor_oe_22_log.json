The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, based on their properties such as size, position, and color. Specifically, the operations appear to include moving, scaling, and recoloring objects.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I would do to transform it into the corresponding output sequence:\n\n1. First, identify the objects in the input sequence. There are five objects, each consisting of a single pixel of color:\n\t* Object 1: [0, 5] (color 5)\n\t* Object 2: [5, 5] (color 5)\n\t* Object 3: [5, 0] (color 0)\n\t* Object 4: [0, 5] (color 5)\n\t* Object 5: [5, 5] (color 5)\n2. Next, apply the following transformations to each object:\n\t* Object 1: Move 1 pixel to the right (new position: [1, 5])\n\t* Object 2: Scale up by a factor of 2 (new size: [2, 2])\n\t* Object 3: Recolor to color 7 (new color: [7, 0])\n\t* Object 4: Remove (removed from the sequence)\n\t* Object 5: Copy and move 1 pixel down (new position: [6, 5])\n3. Finally, concatenate the transformed objects to create the output sequence:\n```\noutput = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nHere's the description of the transformation in more detail:\n\n* Object 1: Moving 1 pixel to the right changes its position from [0, 5] to [1, 5].\n* Object 2: Scaling up by a factor of 2 increases its size from [5, 5] to [2, 2].\n* Object 3: Recoloring from color 5 to color 7 changes its color from [5, 0] to [7, 0].\n* Object 4: Removing the object completely removes it from the sequence.\n* Object 5: Copying and moving 1 pixel down changes its position from [5, 5] to [6, 5], while keeping its original size and color.\n\nOverall, the transformation pattern appears to involve applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence based on their properties, such as size, position, and color. In this specific case, we moved one object, scaled another up, recolored a third, removed a fourth, and copied and moved a fifth to create the desired output sequence."
