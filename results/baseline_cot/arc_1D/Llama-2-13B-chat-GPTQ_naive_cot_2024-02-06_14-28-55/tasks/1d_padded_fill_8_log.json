The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and the description of the input-output relationship, it seems that the task involves applying a set of transformations to the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 9, representing different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.\n* The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of transformations that involve object manipulation, such as moving, resizing, rotating, and copying objects.\n* The transformations are applied in a specific order, and some transformations may depend on the results of previous transformations.\n\nTo solve this task, I would suggest starting by carefully analyzing each example and identifying the key transformations that need to be applied to the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence. It may be helpful to create a step-by-step plan for each example, outlining the specific transformations that need to be performed in what order.\n\nOnce you have a good understanding of the transformations required for each example, you can write down the general pattern that underlies all the examples. This will involve identifying common elements among the transformations, such as object movement, resizing, rotation, etc., and describing how these elements fit together to produce the desired output sequence.\n\nFinally, to complete the task, you will need to provide the actual code that implements the necessary transformations, using Python's NumPy library to perform the operations efficiently. This code should include the appropriate logic for handling the input and output sequences, as well as any necessary error checking and handling.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the steps involved."
