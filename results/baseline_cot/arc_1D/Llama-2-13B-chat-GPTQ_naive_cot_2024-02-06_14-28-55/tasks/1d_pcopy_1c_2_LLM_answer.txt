You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.

Here's my understanding of the transformation pattern:

* Objects:
	+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., 1 pixel).
	+ Resizing: Pixels can change size, either growing or shrinking by a fixed amount (e.g., 2 pixels).
	+ Color changing: Pixels can change color, either to a new color or back to the background color (0).
	+ Removal: Pixels can be removed entirely.
* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be replaced with noise pixels (randomly chosen integer value between 0 and 8).
* Arithmetic operations: The output sequence may involve arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, or other simple calculations based on the object properties.
* Conditional logic: The transformation may involve conditional statements that depend on the properties of the objects.

Based on these patterns, here's my inference for the transformation rule:

The transformation takes the input sequence of pixel colors and applies a series of transformations to produce the output sequence. These transformations include movement, resizing, color changing, removal, and noise pixels. Additionally, the transformation may involve arithmetic operations and conditional logic based on the object properties.

Now, let me apply this transformation rule to the given test input sequence:

Input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

First, let's identify the objects in the input sequence:

Object 1: [0, 1, 1, 1] (color: 1, start index: 1, end index: 4, size: 3)
Object 2: [1, 0, 0, 0] (color: 0, start index: 5, end index: 7, size: 3)
Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 1] (color: 1, start index: 8, end index: 10, size: 3)

Now, let's apply the transformation rules:

1. Move: Object 1 moves 1 pixel to the right, so its new position is [1, 1, 1, 2].
2. Resize: Object 2 grows by 2 pixels, so its new size is 5.
3. Color changing: Object 3 changes color to 2, so its new color is [2, 2, 2, 2].
4. Remove: The pixel at index 7 (color: 0) is removed.
5. Noise pixels: Randomly replace one pixel with a noise pixel (color: 8). In this case, we'll replace the pixel at index 3 (color: 1) with a noise pixel, so the new sequence is [1, 1, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].

And there you have it! The transformed output sequence is:

Output: [1, 1, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to perform additional transformations.
