The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them up or down, and changing their color. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all the zeros in the input sequence have been replaced with the value 2, indicating that all the objects in the input sequence have been moved to the right by one position.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all the objects in the input sequence have been scaled up by a factor of 5, resulting in larger objects but no changes in their positions.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all the objects in the input sequence have been moved to the left by one position, resulting in a shift of all objects by one position to the left.\n\nBased on these examples, we can infer that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as movement, scaling, and color change. These operations seem to be applied independently to each object in the sequence, without any apparent dependencies between adjacent objects.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, thinking step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. This can be done by looking for consecutive runs of the same color. For example, in the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], we can identify four objects of color 4, each consisting of four consecutive elements.\n2. Next, we need to determine the operation to apply to each object. Based on the examples provided, we can see that the operations involve moving objects to the left or right, scaling them up or down, and changing their color. We will need to decide which operation to apply to each object based on its properties.\n3. Once we have decided on the operation to apply to each object, we need to perform the operation. For example, if we want to move an object to the right by one position, we will need to shift all subsequent elements to the left by one position. If we want to scale an object up by a factor of 5, we will need to multiply all elements of the object by 5.\n4. Finally, we need to check the resulting output sequence to ensure that it meets the desired criteria. For example, we may need to adjust the position or size of objects to ensure that they do not overlap or leave gaps between them.\n\nHere is the transformation I would suggest for the test input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Move the first object (color 4) to the right by one position: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n* Scale the second object (color 4) up by a factor of 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 4, 0, 0, 6]\n* Move the third object (color 4) to the left by one position: [0, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 4, 0, 0, 6]\n* Change the fourth object (color 4) to color 2: [0, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 4, 0, 0, 6]\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 4, 0, 0, 6]\n\nI hope this helps!
