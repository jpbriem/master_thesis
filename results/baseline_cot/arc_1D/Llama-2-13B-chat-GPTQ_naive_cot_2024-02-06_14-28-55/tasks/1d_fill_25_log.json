The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, changing size, and sometimes disappearing or appearing. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObjects:\n\n* Object 1 (color 7): starts at index 1 and ends at index 3, with a size of 2.\n* Object 2 (color 0): starts at index 4 and ends at index 6, with a size of 2.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Object 1 moves right by 2 positions.\n* Object 2 appears at index 4 and moves right by 2 positions.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nObjects:\n\n* Object 1 (color 6): starts at index 1 and ends at index 3, with a size of 3.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Object 1 grows by 2 times its original size.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nObjects:\n\n* Object 1 (color 7): starts at index 1 and ends at index 3, with a size of 3.\n* Object 2 (color 7): starts at index 4 and ends at index 6, with a size of 3.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Object 1 moves up by 1 position.\n* Object 2 appears at index 4 and moves up by 1 position.\n\nBased on these examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount, growing or shrinking objects, and sometimes adding or removing objects entirely.\n\nNow, let me analyze the given test input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObjects:\n\n* Object 1 (color 1): starts at index 1 and ends at index 2, with a size of 1.\n* Object 2 (color 0): starts at index 3 and ends at index 4, with a size of 1.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into the corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the transformation pattern described above. Here's the step-by-step transformation process:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 right by 1 position.\n\nNew object positions:\n\n* Object 1 (color 1): starts at index 2 and ends at index 3, with a size of 1.\n\nStep 2: Appear object 2 at index 4 and move it right by 1 position.\n\nNew object positions:\n\n* Object 1 (color 1): starts at index 2 and ends at index 3, with a size of 1.\n* Object 2 (color 0): starts at index 4 and ends at index 5, with a size of 1.\n\nFinal output sequence:\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
