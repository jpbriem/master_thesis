The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of the three examples:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of zeros with one non-zero value (7) at index 7. The output sequence consists of zeros with the same size and shape as the input sequence, but with the single non-zero value moved to index 0. This suggests that the transformation involves moving the non-zero value to the beginning of the sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have an input sequence of ones with one missing value (at index 6). The output sequence has all ones, but with the missing value replaced by the value at index 0 (i.e., 6). This indicates that the transformation involves copying the value at index 0 into the missing spot.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this case, we have an input sequence of fives with no missing values. The output sequence is identical to the input sequence, but with all values increased by 5. This suggests that the transformation involves adding a constant value (5) to every value in the input sequence.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer that the general transformation rule is to apply a specific operation to each object in the input sequence, where the object is defined by its size, position, and color. The specific operations that can be applied include moving, copying, replacing, and scaling.\n\nNow, let's consider the given test case:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nTo apply the transformation, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. We can see that there are three objects:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 8, position: 0-7, color: 0)\n* Object 2: [4, 4, 4] (size: 3, position: 8-10, color: 4)\n* Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 8, position: 11-18, color: 0)\n\nNext, we need to determine the appropriate transformation operation for each object. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, we can see that the transformation operations involve moving, copying, and scaling.\n\nFor Object 1, we can observe that the value at index 7 is moved to index 0, so the transformation operation for Object 1 is to move the value at index 7 to index 0.\n\nFor Object 2, we can see that the value at index 8 is copied to indices 0-2, so the transformation operation for Object 2 is to copy the value at index 8 to indices 0-2.\n\nFor Object 3, we can observe that the value at index 11 is scaled up by a factor of 5, so the transformation operation for Object 3 is to multiply the value at index 11 by 5.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the output sequence is the same length as the input sequence, and the objects have been transformed according to their respective sizes, positions, and colors.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the steps involved in the transformation process."
