The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, let me describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on their size, position, and color:\n\nObjects:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3} (represented by three consecutive pixels of color 8)\n* Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 2} (represented by two consecutive pixels of color 8)\n* Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1} (represented by one pixel of color 0)\n\nNext, I will describe the transformation pattern that relates the input and output sequences:\n\nPattern:\n\n* Objects are moved, resized, or replaced based on specific rules.\n* Noise pixels may be added or removed.\n* Arithmetical operations are performed on object sizes and positions.\n\nNow, let me apply this pattern to the input sequence and generate the corresponding output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation process:\n\n1. Object_1: Move 2 pixels to the right, resize to 3 pixels, and change color to 2.\n2. Object_2: Resize to 2 pixels and move 1 pixel down.\n3. Object_3: Remove.\n4. Add noise pixel at index 4 (color 0).\n5. Add noise pixel at index 7 (color 0).\n6. Object_1: Move 1 pixel to the left and resize to 2 pixels.\n7. Object_2: Move 1 pixel up and resize to 2 pixels.\n8. Add noise pixel at index 8 (color 9).\n9. Add noise pixel at index 9 (color 9).\n\nTherefore, the output sequence is obtained by applying the above transformation pattern to the input sequence.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON response you requested:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}"
