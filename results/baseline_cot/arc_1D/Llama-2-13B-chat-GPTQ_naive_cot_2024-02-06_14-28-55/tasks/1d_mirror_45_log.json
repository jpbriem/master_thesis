The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions and noise pixels that affect the transformation.\n\nTo describe the transformation pattern, we can start by identifying the objects in the input sequence. In the given input sequence [7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we can identify three objects:\n\nObject 1: [7, 7] (size: 2x2, position: 1st and 2nd pixels)\nObject 2: [9] (size: 1x1, position: 4th pixel)\nObject 3: [0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 4x4, position: 6th to 9th pixels, and 0th pixel)\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation pattern to this input sequence. We can start by moving Object 1 two positions to the right, so it becomes [7, 7, 0, 0]. This is because the first object is moved two positions to the right, since the second object has a larger size.\n\nNext, we need to scale Object 2 down to size 0x1, so it becomes [9]. This is because the third object is scaled down to size 1x1.\n\nAfter that, we need to remove Object 3, since it has a size of 4x4 and all its pixels are zero. So, the updated sequence becomes [7, 7, 0, 0, 9].\n\nFinally, we need to change the color of the remaining object (Object 1) to 9, since the condition is met. Therefore, the final output sequence is [7, 7, 0, 0, 9].\n\nHere's the overall pattern for all input-output pairs:\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n* Identify objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color.\n* Apply operations to each object based on its properties, such as moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color.\n* Conditions and noise pixels may also affect the transformation.\n\nAnd here's the transformation for the given test input sequence:\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Move Object 1 two positions to the right.\n* Scale Object 2 down to size 0x1.\n* Remove Object 3 since it has a size of 4x4 and all its pixels are zero.\n* Change the color of Object 1 to 9 since the condition is met.\n\nTest Output:\n\n[7, 7, 0, 0, 9]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
