The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:\n\n* Moving objects (represented by changes in position)\n* Resizing objects (represented by changes in size)\n* Changing object colors (represented by changes in color value)\n* Removing objects (represented by gaps in the sequence)\n\nAdditionally, there may be some noise pixels added to the output sequence.\n\nTo begin, let's analyze the first example:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of objects of color 0, followed by a single object of color 9. The output sequence has the same objects, but they have been moved and resized. Specifically:\n\n* Objects of color 0 have been moved one position to the right and resized to twice their original size.\n* Objects of color 9 have been moved two positions to the left and resized to half their original size.\n\nNow, let's consider the second example:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9]\nOutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of objects of color 0 and 9, with some gaps. The output sequence has the same objects, but they have been moved and resized. Specifically:\n\n* Objects of color 0 have been moved one position to the right and resized to twice their original size.\n* Objects of color 9 have been moved two positions to the left and resized to half their original size.\n* Some noise pixels have been added to the output sequence.\n\nFinally, let's consider the third example:\n\nInput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of objects of color 0 and 9, with no gaps. The output sequence has the same objects, but they have been moved and resized. Specifically:\n\n* Objects of color 0 have been moved one position to the right and resized to twice their original size.\n* Objects of color 9 have been moved two positions to the left and resized to half their original size.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving and resizing objects, as well as adding noise pixels. To transform a new input sequence, we would need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformations based on the patterns observed in the examples.\n\nHere is the JSON response for the given input sequence:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"....\",\n\"Overall_Pattern\": \"describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"Instructions\": \"describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"Transformation\": {\n\"Input\": \"copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"Test_Output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nThe input sequence to be transformed is [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]. Applying the transformations observed in the examples, the output sequence would be:\n\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9]"
