The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing the color of objects.\n\nFor Example_1, we can see that the input sequence consists of seven identical objects of color 7, followed by three zero-valued objects at the end. The output sequence has the same number of objects, but each object has been moved one position to the left and has had its color changed to 0.\n\nFor Example_2, the input sequence consists of three identical objects of color 3, followed by three zero-valued objects at the end. The output sequence has the same number of objects, but each object has been scaled up by a factor of three.\n\nFor Example_3, the input sequence consists of eight zero-valued objects, followed by four identical objects of color 4. The output sequence has the same number of objects, but each object has been moved two positions to the right and has had its color changed to 4.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer that the desired transformation is a function that takes an input sequence of integers and applies the following operations:\n\n* Moves each object one position to the left (if the object is not already at the leftmost position).\n* Changes the color of each object to 0 if it is not already 0.\n* Scales each object by a factor of 3 (if the object is not already at the rightmost position).\n* Removes any zero-valued objects from the end of the sequence.\n\nTo perform this transformation on a given input sequence, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Scan the input sequence from left to right, keeping track of the current object being processed.\n2. If the current object is not already at the leftmost position, move it one position to the left.\n3. If the current object is not already 0, change its color to 0.\n4. If the current object is not already at the rightmost position, scale it by a factor of 3.\n5. Remove any zero-valued objects from the end of the sequence.\n\nWith this understanding of the transformation pattern, let's now consider the test case input sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the above steps to this input sequence yields the following output sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence contains no non-zero-valued objects and all objects have been moved to the leftmost position."
