The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 2, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors, and the output sequence is also a series of pixels with the same values. The transformation from input to output appears to follow a specific pattern based on certain logical rules, including object transformations, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd here's my description of the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}\nObject_2: {color: 4, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 3}\nObject_3: {color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 10, size: 3}\n\nNow, let me describe how these objects should look like in the test output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs we can see, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence, except for some minor changes in the positions and sizes of the objects. In particular:\n\n* Object_1 has moved one position to the left and has increased in size from 4 to 5 pixels.\n* Object_2 has moved three positions to the right and has decreased in size from 3 to 2 pixels.\n* Object_3 has moved two positions to the left and has decreased in size from 3 to 2 pixels.\n\nFinally, here's the transformation action needed to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nTransformation:\n\n1. Move Object_1 one position to the left (from index 1 to index 0).\n2. Resize Object_1 from 4 to 5 pixels.\n3. Move Object_2 three positions to the right (from index 5 to index 8).\n4. Resize Object_2 from 3 to 2 pixels.\n5. Move Object_3 two positions to the left (from index 8 to index 6).\n6. Resize Object_3 from 3 to 2 pixels.\n\nWith these transformations applied, we get the desired output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
