            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Specifically, objects that are adjacent to each other in the input sequence and have the same color are combined into a single object in the output sequence. Additionally, any noise pixels (represented by the value 0) in the input sequence are removed from the output sequence.\n\nTo describe the transformation in more detail, here are the steps I would take to transform the test input sequence:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color. In this case, there are eight objects of color 8.\n2. Check if any two adjacent objects have the same color. If they do, combine them into a single object.\n3. Remove any noise pixels (0) from the input sequence.\n4. Create the output sequence by listing out the combined objects in the order they appear in the input sequence.\n\nHere's the detailed description of the transformation for the test input sequence:\n\nInput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObjects:\n\n* Object 1: [8, 8] (color: 8, start index: 0, end index: 2)\n* Object 2: [8, 8] (color: 8, start index: 3, end index: 5)\n* Object 3: [8, 8] (color: 8, start index: 6, end index: 8)\n\nCombine Objects 1 and 2 since they are adjacent and have the same color:\n\n* Combined Object: [8, 8, 8] (color: 8, start index: 0, end index: 5)\n\nRemove noise pixels (0):\n\n* Output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (color: 8, start index: 0, end index: 8)\n\nOverall pattern: The input sequence is transformed by combining adjacent objects of the same color and removing noise pixels.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
