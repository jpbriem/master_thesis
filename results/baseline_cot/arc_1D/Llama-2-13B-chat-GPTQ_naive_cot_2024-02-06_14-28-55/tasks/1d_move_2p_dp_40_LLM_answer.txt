You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there are some noise pixels that need to be taken into account.

To begin, let's take a closer look at the input sequence you provided:

`input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]`

From this input sequence, we can identify several objects:

* Object 1: `color = 2`, `start_index = 1`, `end_index = 2`, `size = 2` (represented by the two consecutive pixels with value 2)
* Object 2: `color = 2`, `start_index = 4`, `end_index = 6`, `size = 2` (represented by the two consecutive pixels with value 2 starting from index 4)
* Object 3: `color = 7`, `start_index = 7`, `end_index = 9`, `size = 3` (represented by the three consecutive pixels with value 7 starting from index 7)

Now, let's apply the transformation rules to these objects:

* Object 1: Move 1 pixel to the right (since the object starts at index 1 and ends at index 2, we need to move the second pixel one index to the right).
* Object 2: Scale up by 2x (since the object starts at index 4 and ends at index 6, we need to double the number of pixels).
* Object 3: Remove (since the object starts at index 7 and ends at index 9, we need to remove the three pixels).

After applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:

`output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0]`

As you can see, the output sequence has undergone several changes compared to the input sequence:

* Object 1 has been moved one pixel to the right.
* Object 2 has been scaled up by 2x.
* Object 3 has been removed.
* There are now two noise pixels with value 1 at the beginning and end of the sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to perform additional tasks.
