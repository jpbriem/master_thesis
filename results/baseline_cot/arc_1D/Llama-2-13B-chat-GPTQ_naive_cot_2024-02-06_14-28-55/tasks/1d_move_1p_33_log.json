The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of zeros and twos. The output sequence consists of only zeros, indicating that all objects (represented by twos) were removed. This suggests that the transformation involves removing objects based on their color value.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have an input sequence of zeros and sixes. The output sequence contains only zeros, indicating that all objects (represented by sixes) were replaced with zeros. This implies that the transformation can also involve replacing objects with other objects or with background color (represented by zeros).\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of zeros and no objects. The output sequence contains only one object (a six), suggesting that the transformation can introduce new objects into the sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions, such as removal, replacement, or introduction of new objects. To perform the transformation, we need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate action based on the object's properties and the desired output.\n\nNow, let's consider the test case provided:\n\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, let's analyze the input sequence:\n\n* The input sequence consists of nine elements, all of which are equal to three.\n* There are no zeroes or other objects in the input sequence.\n\nBased on the above, we can conclude that the input sequence contains only one type of object (represented by the number three). Therefore, the transformation will likely involve combining these objects in some way.\n\nNext, let's consider the desired output sequence:\n\n* The output sequence should consist of nine elements, all of which are equal to zero.\n* There should be no objects in the output sequence.\n\nFrom these specifications, we can deduce that the transformation involves removing all objects from the input sequence and replacing them with zeroes.\n\nNow, let's create the transformation function:\n```json\ntransformation = {\n    \"input\": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"object_description\": [\"All objects are equal to 3\"],\n    \"transformed_objects\": [{\"size\": 9, \"position\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"color\": 0}],\n    \"output\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n}\n```\nAs specified in the instructions, we need to describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color. In this case, we have a single object of size 9, located at position [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The object has color 3.\n\nFinally, let's create the test output sequence:\n```numpy\ntest_output = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\nThis array has the same shape and dimensions as the input sequence, but with all elements set to zero.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is:\n\n{'description': {'Example_1':'removed all objects', 'Example_2':'replaced objects with zeros', 'Example_3': 'introduced a new object'}, 'overall_pattern': 'combine objects based on certain conditions', 'instructions': 'apply the transformation to a new input sequence', 'transformation': transformation, 'test_output': test_output}"
