[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my analysis:

* The input sequence consists of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors.
* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.
* The output sequence also consists of pixels with values from 0 to 9, but with some modifications based on the objects in the input sequence.

Based on the examples given, here's the transformation pattern I observe:

* Objects in the input sequence can undergo certain transformations, such as moving, resizing, changing color, or being removed.
* These transformations are applied based on specific rules, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.
* Noise pixels may also be introduced or removed in the transformation process.

Now, let me describe the transformation for each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]. The output sequence is obtained by applying the following transformations:

* Move object 0 (value 0) to the beginning of the sequence.
* Move object 6 (value 6) to the end of the sequence.
* Change the color of object 6 from 0 to 6.

Example 2:
In this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output sequence is obtained by applying the following transformations:

* Move object 7 (value 7) to the beginning of the sequence.
* Change the color of object 7 from 0 to 7.
* Introduce noise pixels with value 0 throughout the sequence.

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output sequence is obtained by applying the following transformations:

* Move object 8 (value 8) to the beginning of the sequence.
* Resize object 8 to twice its original size.
* Change the color of object 8 from 0 to 8.

Now, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output:

1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!
2. Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
3. Apply the appropriate transformations based on the rules mentioned above, taking into account the object descriptions.
4. Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!

Finally, here's the transformation I would apply to the test input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
