[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Example_3:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]



Test case:

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.

To begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:

Input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]

Now, let me analyze the patterns in the input sequence:

* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each consisting of a group of consecutive pixels with the same color. The objects are:
	+ Object_1: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0] (color: 7)
	+ Object_2: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] (color: 7)
	+ Object_3: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] (color: 7)
* Noise pixels: There are several noise pixels scattered throughout the input sequence, with random values.
* Arithmetical operations: There are several instances of arithmetical operations performed on the objects, such as adding or subtracting pixels.

Based on these observations, I can infer that the transformation from input to output involves applying a set of rules to the objects in the input sequence. These rules may involve moving, resizing, rotating, or modifying the objects in some way. Additionally, there may be some noise reduction or smoothing techniques applied to the input sequence before the transformation.

Now, let me describe the output sequence for the given input:

Output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0] (color: 9)

As we can see, the output sequence has undergone significant changes compared to the input sequence. The objects in the input sequence have been transformed, resized, and repositioned to create a new pattern. Specifically:

* Object_1 has been moved to the left and resized to twice its original size.
* Object_2 has been moved to the right and resized to three times its original size.
* Object_3 has been removed and replaced with a new object consisting of nine pixels with the same color.

Overall, the transformation from input to output involves a combination of object manipulation, noise reduction, and arithmetical operations to create a new pattern. To perform this transformation, we need to carefully examine the input sequence and apply the appropriate rules to each object.

Here's the detailed description of the transformation:

1. Object_1: Move to the left and resize to twice its original size.
2. Object_2: Move to the right and resize to three times its original size.
3. Object_3: Remove and replace with a new object consisting of nine pixels with the same color.
4. Noise pixels: Apply noise reduction techniques to reduce the number of noise pixels.
5. Arithmetical operations: Perform addition and subtraction operations on the objects to create the desired pattern.

And here's the resulting output sequence:

Output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0] (color: 9)

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the steps involved in the transformation.
