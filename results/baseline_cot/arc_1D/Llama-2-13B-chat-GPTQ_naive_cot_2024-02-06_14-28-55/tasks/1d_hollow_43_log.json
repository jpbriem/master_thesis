The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we see two objects of color 2, one with size 2x2 and another with size 1x2. The transformation moves both objects to the left, so that they no longer overlap. This can be achieved by simply shifting the object positions to the left by 2 units.\n\nExample 2:\nHere, we have three objects of color 3, all with size 1x3. The transformation removes the middle object, leaving only the two outer objects. This can be done by setting the middle object's size to 0.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have eight objects of color 2, all with size 1x2. The transformation changes the color of half of the objects to 0. This can be achieved by setting the color of every other object to 0.\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case input sequence:\n\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI observe that there are five objects of color 5, all with size 1x5. There are also five noise pixels (represented by 0).\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I need to apply the transformation pattern observed in the examples. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, I notice that there are five objects of color 5, all with size 1x5. Since the transformation pattern involves moving objects to the left, I will shift all objects to the left by 5 units. This will create some gaps in the sequence where the noise pixels were previously located.\n2. Next, I see that there are five noise pixels scattered throughout the sequence. To eliminate these noise pixels, I will set their values to 0.\n3. Finally, I observe that there are still five objects remaining after applying the previous steps. Since the transformation pattern involves changing the color of some objects, I will change the color of every other object to 0. This will result in three objects retaining their original color 5, while the remaining two objects will have their color changed to 0.\n\nAnd here's the resulting output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has undergone several transformations compared to the input sequence. First, all objects were shifted to the left by 5 units, creating gaps in the sequence where the noise pixels were previously located. Second, the noise pixels were set to 0. Finally, every other object had its color changed to 0, resulting in three objects retaining their original color 5 and two objects having their color changed to 0."
