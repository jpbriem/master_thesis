The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 5]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them down, and changing their color. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7]\nOutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 5]\n\nIn this example, we can see that some objects (represented by the numbers 7) are moved to the left or right, while others are resized to half their original size. Additionally, some objects change color from black (0) to white (2).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nHere, we can see that some objects are moved up or down, while others are resized to twice their original size. Some objects also change color from black (0) to red (1).\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all objects are resized to half their original size, and some objects change color from black (0) to blue (2).\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns I observed in the previous examples, here's what I would expect the output sequence to look like:\n\nOutput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, some objects are moved, resized, or changed color. Specifically, objects at positions 1, 3, and 6 are moved to the left, while objects at positions 2 and 8 are moved to the right. Objects at positions 4 and 7 are resized to half their original size, and object at position 5 changes color from black (0) to red (1).\n\nTo summarize, the input-output pattern appears to involve various transformations such as movement, resizing, and color changes. These transformations seem to be applied independently to each object in the input sequence, without any apparent dependencies between objects."
