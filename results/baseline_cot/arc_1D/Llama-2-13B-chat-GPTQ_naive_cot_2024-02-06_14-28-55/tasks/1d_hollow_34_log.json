            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects (or pixels) around, resizing them, and changing their color. The noise pixels also seem to play a role in the transformation.\n\nFor the test input sequence `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I observe:\n\n* The input sequence consists of seven identical objects of color 7, each with a size of 7 pixels.\n* The output sequence should be transformed such that each object is moved to the left by one pixel position, so that they no longer overlap.\n* Since there are no noise pixels in the input sequence, there should be no noise pixels in the output sequence either.\n\nBased on these observations, here's the transformation that can be applied to the input sequence:\n\n1. Move each object one pixel to the left by shifting the entire sequence one pixel to the left.\n2. Resize each object to a size of 6 pixels, since they were originally 7 pixels wide.\n3. Change the color of each object to 0, since there are no more overlapping objects.\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nIn JSON format, the description of the transformation would be:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"moving objects one pixel to the left, resizing to 6 pixels wide, and changing color to 0\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"...\",\n    \"Example_3\": \"...\",\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"moving and resizing objects, changing color based on overlap\"\n  },\n  \"instructions\": \"shift the input sequence one pixel to the left, resize objects to 6 pixels wide, change color to 0\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": \"identical objects of color 7, each with a size of 7 pixels\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"objects moved one pixel to the left, resized to 6 pixels wide, and changed color to 0\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n  },\n  \"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```"
