            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions and noise pixels that need to be taken into account.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are 7 objects in the input sequence, each with a size of 7 pixels. They are all colored 7.\n* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n* Arithmetic operations: None.\n* Conditions: None.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I would perform the following steps:\n\n1. Move object 1 (start index 0, end index 7) 3 pixels to the right (new start index 3, new end index 10).\n2. Scale object 2 (start index 7, end index 14) by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions (new start index 14, new end index 28).\n3. Change the color of object 3 (start index 14, end index 21) to 8.\n4. Remove object 4 (start index 21, end index 25).\n5. Copy object 5 (start index 25, end index 29) and move it 2 pixels to the left (new start index 23, new end index 27).\n6. Scale object 6 (start index 29, end index 33) by a factor of 2 in the x direction (new start index 29, new end index 39).\n7. Overlap object 7 (start index 33, end index 37) with object 6 by 2 pixels.\n8. Set all remaining pixels to 0.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n```json\n[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to analyze another input sequence."
