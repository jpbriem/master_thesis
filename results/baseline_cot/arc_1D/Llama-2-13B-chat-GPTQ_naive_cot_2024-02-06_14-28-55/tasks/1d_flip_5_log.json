The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some logical rules and patterns.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors.\n* Each object in the input sequence is defined by its color and size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of the same color).\n* The output sequence will also consist of pixels with values from 0 to 9, but with some transformations applied to the objects based on their properties.\n* The transformations may include moving, resizing, rotating, copying, and recoloring objects.\n* There may be noise pixels in the input sequence that need to be filtered out.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the examples provided, here's what I observe about the input sequence:\n\n* There are several objects in the input sequence, each defined by its color and size.\n* The largest object is the one with the value 7, which spans from positions 8 to 15 (inclusive) and has a size of 8 pixels.\n* There are smaller objects at positions 2, 2, 2, and 2, each with a size of 2 pixels.\n* All other pixels in the input sequence have a value of 0.\n\nNow, let me describe the desired output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the examples provided, here's what I believe needs to be done to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\n1. Move the object with the value 7 to the beginning of the sequence, starting from position 0.\n2. Resize the object with the value 7 to a size of 3 pixels.\n3. Copy the object with the value 2 and place it after the object with the value 7, but shifted to the right by 1 pixel.\n4. Resize the object with the value 2 to a size of 3 pixels.\n5. Remove any noise pixels with a value of 0.\n6. Recolor the remaining objects with the following colors: 2 -> 3, 2 -> 3, 2 -> 3, and 2 -> 3.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to do or if you have any further questions."
