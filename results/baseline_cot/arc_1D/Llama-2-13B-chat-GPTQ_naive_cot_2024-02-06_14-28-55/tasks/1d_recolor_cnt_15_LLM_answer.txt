You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.

To begin, let me describe the input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The input sequence consists of 16 pixels, each with a value of either 0 (background color) or 7 (foreground color). There are several objects in the input sequence, including two long objects made up of consecutive pixels of the same color (the first object has a length of 4 pixels, and the second object has a length of 3 pixels).

Now, let me describe the desired output sequence:

Output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output sequence is derived from the input sequence through a series of transformations that involve object movements, resizing, and color changes. Specifically, the objects in the input sequence appear to be moved, resized, and modified in various ways to create the output sequence.

To perform the transformation, I will need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and determine the appropriate actions to take based on the patterns and rules provided. Here is my plan of action:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence: First, I will identify the objects in the input sequence based on their size, position, and color. In particular, I will look for contiguous runs of pixels with the same color, as these are likely to represent objects.
2. Determine object properties: Next, I will determine the properties of each identified object, such as its size, position, and color. This information will be crucial for applying the appropriate transformations to the objects.
3. Apply transformations: Once I have identified the objects and determined their properties, I will apply the appropriate transformations to them. These transformations may include moving objects to different positions, resizing them, changing their color, or removing them altogether.
4. Check for noise pixels: After applying the transformations, I will check for any noise pixels that may have been introduced during the process. If necessary, I will remove these pixels to ensure that the output sequence is clean and free of errors.
5. Output the result: Finally, I will output the resulting output sequence in numpy array format, as requested.

Here is the code I will use to perform the transformation:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the input sequence
input_sequence = [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Identify objects in the input sequence
objects = []
for i in range(len(input_sequence)):
    if input_sequence[i] == 7:
        objects.append([i, i + 1])

# Determine object properties
object_properties = {}
for obj in objects:
    object_properties[obj] = {"size": len(obj), "position": obj[0], "color": 7}

# Apply transformations
for obj in objects:
    # Move objects to different positions
    if object_properties[obj]["size"] > 1:
        input_sequence[object_properties[obj]["position"]] = 8
    # Resize objects
    else:
        input_sequence[object_properties[obj]["position"]] = 5

# Check for noise pixels
noise_pixels = []
for i in range(len(input_sequence)):
    if input_sequence[i] == 0:
        noise_pixels.append(i)

# Remove noise pixels
if noise_pixels:
    input_sequence = np.delete(input_sequence, noise_pixels)

# Output the result
output_sequence = np.array(input_sequence)
print(output_sequence)
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
