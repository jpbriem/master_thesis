The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:\n\n* Objects: Each object in the input sequence is represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example, in Example_1, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 2 and size 2x2, and Object_2 with color 3 and size 1x1.\n* Transformations: The transformations applied to the objects seem to be based on logical rules, such as moving, resizing, changing color, and removing objects. For instance, in Example_1, Object_1 is moved one position to the right, while Object_2 is removed. In Example_2, the objects are resized and their colors are changed.\n* Noise pixels: There are also noise pixels scattered throughout the input sequences, which do not belong to any objects. These pixels seem to be unaffected by the transformations.\n* Arithmetic operations: The transformations involve arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, and counting the number of objects. For example, in Example_1, the number of objects (2) is counted and used to determine the size of Object_1.\n* Conditional logic: The transformations are conditioned upon certain criteria, such as the color of the objects. For example, in Example_2, the objects are resized based on their color: objects with color 2 are resized to 2x2, while objects with color 3 are resized to 1x1.\n\nBased on these observations, I would infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a mapping from objects to other objects, possibly involving transformations such as movement, resizing, color changes, and removal. The noise pixels remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let me apply this understanding to the given test case:\n\nInput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nObject description:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1}\n\nTransformed objects:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1}\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 0]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Object_1 remains unchanged.\n2. Object_2 is moved one position to the right and its color is changed to 7.\n3. The noise pixels at indices 0 and 5 are left unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the transformation from input to output is simply a matter of moving Object_2 one position to the right and changing its color, while leaving the other objects and noise pixels unchanged.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
