[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Specifically, if two adjacent pixels have the same color, they are combined into a single object. Additionally, if there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, they are also combined into a single object.

Applying this pattern to the given input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], we can identify the following objects:

* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 4)
* Object 2: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 2)

Since these objects are of the same color (respectively, 0 and 2), they can be combined according to the pattern. Therefore, the resulting output sequence would be:

output: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In terms of the overall pattern, the input-output relationship can be described as follows:

* If two adjacent pixels have the same color, they are combined into a single object.
* If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, they are also combined into a single object.

To transform a new input sequence, the following steps can be taken:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color.
2. Combine adjacent objects of the same color into a single object.
3. Remove any remaining isolated pixels (i.e., those that are not part of an object).

The resulting output sequence will consist of objects of varying sizes, positions, and colors, depending on the original input sequence.

Finally, here is the test output sequence in numpy array format:

output = np.array([0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
