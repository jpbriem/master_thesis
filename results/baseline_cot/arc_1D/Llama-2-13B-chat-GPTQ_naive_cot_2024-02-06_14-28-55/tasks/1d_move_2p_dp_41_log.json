            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves making certain objects \"hollow\" (i.e., changing their color to 0), while others remain unchanged. Additionally, there appear to be some noise pixels that need to be addressed.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the input sequence:\n\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI see that there are three objects in this sequence: two objects of color 2, and one object of color 3. The objects are separated by zero-indexed positions, so the first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 2, the second object starts at index 3 and ends at index 4, and the third object starts at index 5 and ends at index 6.\n\nNow, let's consider what needs to change in order to produce the desired output sequence. Based on the examples provided, we can see that any objects that have a color of 0 should be made \"hollow\" by changing their color to 0. Additionally, any noise pixels (i.e., pixels with a value of 0) should be removed.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, here's the transformation plan for the given input sequence:\n\n1. Make any objects with a color of 0 \"hollow\" by changing their color to 0.\n2. Remove any noise pixels (i.e., pixels with a value of 0).\n\nApplying these transformations to the input sequence yields the following output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nAs expected, the objects of color 0 have been made \"hollow,\" and any noise pixels have been removed.\n\nIn JSON format, the description of the transformation would look like this:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to perform additional tasks."
