[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, changing size, and sometimes disappearing or appearing. The noise pixels also seem to play a role in the transformation.

For the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]`, here's what I observe:

* Objects: There are two objects in the input sequence: one with color `0` and size `7`, and another with color `0` and size `0`.
* Relations between objects: The larger object (with color `0` and size `7`) overlaps with the smaller object (with color `0` and size `0`).
* Noise pixels: There are three noise pixels in the input sequence, all with value `0`.

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, here's my interpretation of the transformation:

* Objects:
	+ The larger object (with color `0` and size `7`) will move to the right by 3 positions, increasing its size to `10`.
	+ The smaller object (with color `0` and size `0`) will appear on the left side of the larger object, with a size of `3`.
	+ All noise pixels will change to the background color (`0`).
* Relations between objects:
	+ The larger object will now overlap with the smaller object.
* Output sequence:
	+ The final output sequence will be `[0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the transformation:

1. Move the larger object to the right by 3 positions:
	+ [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0].
2. Appear the smaller object on the left side of the larger object:
	+ [0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0] becomes [0, 3, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0].
3. Change all noise pixels to the background color (`0`):
	+ [0, 3, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0] becomes [0, 3, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Therefore, the final output sequence for the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]` is `[0, 3, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
