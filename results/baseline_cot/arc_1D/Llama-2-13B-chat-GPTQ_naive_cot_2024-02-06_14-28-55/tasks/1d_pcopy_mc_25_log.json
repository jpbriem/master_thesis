The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my understanding of the transformation pattern based on the examples:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., [0, 4, 4, 4] moves 4 pixels to the right).\n\t+ Resizing: Pixels can change size by a factor (e.g., [0, 0, 2, 2] becomes [0, 0, 4, 4]).\n\t+ Color changing: Pixels can change color (e.g., [0, 0, 2, 2] becomes [0, 0, 9, 9]).\n\t+ Removal: Pixels can be removed (e.g., [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 0, 0, 0]).\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be replaced with noise pixels (e.g., [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 0, 2, 2, 9]).\n* Arithmetic operations: Pixels can be counted, sorted, or subjected to other arithmetic operations (e.g., [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] becomes [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]).\n* Conditional transformations: Transformations may be conditioned on certain criteria (e.g., if the previous pixel is blue, then the current pixel changes to red).\n\nBased on these patterns, I would infer that the goal of the task is to transform an input sequence of pixel colors into an output sequence of pixel colors using the given transformation rules.\n\nNow, let me apply these patterns to the test input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, I will apply the movement rule to the input sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4 + 4 = 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the first four pixels have moved 4 pixels to the right, and the last pixel has been replaced with a noise pixel (9).\n\nNext, I will apply the resizing rule to the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8 * 2 = 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, each pixel has doubled in size, so the output sequence is twice as long as the input sequence.\n\nFinally, I will apply the color changing rule to the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, all the pixels have changed color to 9.\n\nTherefore, the final output sequence for the test input sequence is:\n\n[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
