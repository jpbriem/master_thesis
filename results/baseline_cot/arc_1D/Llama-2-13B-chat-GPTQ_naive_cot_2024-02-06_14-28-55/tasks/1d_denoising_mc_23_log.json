The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with zero-indexing for the position. The goal is to transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence using some logical rules and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:\n\n* Objects: Each object in the input sequence has a specific size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of the same color) and position (represented by the starting index). Objects can be moved, resized, or copied, but their color remains unchanged.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be noise pixels (represented by the value 0), which do not belong to any object. These pixels can be removed.\n* Arithmetics: The transformation involves simple arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, and incrementing/decrementing the size of objects.\n* Conditions: The transformation is conditioned upon the properties of the objects, such as their size, position, and color.\n\nBased on these observations, I would suggest the following approach to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their size and position.\n2. Move objects based on their properties, such as moving an object to the left or right if it overlaps with another object.\n3. Resize objects based on their properties, such as increasing or decreasing the size of an object.\n4. Remove noise pixels.\n5. Apply arithmetical operations to the objects, such as counting the number of objects and sorting them based on their size.\n6. Output the resulting sequence of pixels.\n\nTo perform these steps, I will need to write code in Python to parse the input sequence, identify objects, apply transformations, and output the resulting sequence. Here's my proposed solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_seq):\n    # Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence\n    objects = []\n    for i in range(len(input_seq)):\n        if input_seq[i]!= 0:\n            objects.append({\"start\": i, \"end\": i + 1})\n    \n    # Step 2: Move objects based on their properties\n    for obj in objects:\n        if obj[\"start\"] < obj[\"end\"] - obj[\"start\"]:\n            # Move object to the left\n            for j in range(obj[\"start\"], obj[\"end\"]):\n                input_seq[j] = input_seq[j + 1]\n        \n        elif obj[\"end\"] - obj[\"start\"] > 1:\n            # Move object to the right\n            for j in range(obj[\"end\"] - 1, obj[\"start\"] - 1, -1):\n                input_seq[j] = input_seq[j - 1]\n        \n        else:\n            # Resize object\n            input_seq[obj[\"start\"]] = input_seq[obj[\"end\"]]\n            \n    # Step 3: Remove noise pixels\n    for i in range(len(input_seq)):\n        if input_seq[i] == 0:\n            input_seq[i] = None\n    \n    # Step 4: Apply arithmetical operations\n    count = 0\n    for obj in objects:\n        count += len(obj)\n    sort_idx = np.argsort(count)\n    for obj in sorted(objects, key=lambda x: x[\"size\"]):\n        input_seq[sort_idx[count - len(obj)]] = obj[\"color\"]\n        count -= len(obj)\n    \n    return input_seq\n\n# Test cases\nprint(transform([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(transform([0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(transform([0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n\n# Test case:\nprint(transform([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n```\nIn this code, we first identify objects in the input sequence based on their size and position. We then move objects based on their properties, resize objects, remove noise pixels, and apply arithmetical operations to the objects. Finally, we output the resulting sequence of pixels.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
