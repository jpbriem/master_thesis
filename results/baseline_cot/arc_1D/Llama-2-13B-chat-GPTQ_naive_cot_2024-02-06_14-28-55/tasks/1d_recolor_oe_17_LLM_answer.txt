You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color.

For the given input sequence `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]`, here's my analysis:

* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color. The objects are:
	+ Object 1: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] (color: 4)
	+ Object 2: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] (color: 4)
	+ Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (color: 0)
* Relations between objects:
	+ Object 1 and Object 2 are adjacent and have the same color (4).
	+ Object 3 is not adjacent to any other object and has a different color (0).
* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.
* Arithmetic operations based on objects: None observed.
* Conditional statements: None observed.

Now, let me describe the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:

Example 1:
Input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence is transformed by applying the following operations to the objects:

* Object 1: Move 1 pixel to the right (from index 1 to index 2).
* Object 2: Move 1 pixel to the left (from index 4 to index 3).
* Object 3: Remove (as there is no object at index 8).

Example 2:
Input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
Output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

In this example, the input sequence is transformed by applying the following operations to the objects:

* Object 1: Resize to twice the original size (from 4 pixels wide to 8 pixels wide).
* Object 2: Move 1 pixel down (from index 4 to index 5).
* Object 3: Remove (as there is no object at index 8).

Example 3:
Input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
Output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

In this example, the input sequence is transformed by applying the following operations to the objects:

* Object 1: Move 1 pixel up (from index 1 to index 0).
* Object 2: Move 1 pixel down (from index 4 to index 5).
* Object 3: Remove (as there is no object at index 8).

Based on these observations, I can infer that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and removing objects. The specific operations applied seem to depend on the location and properties of the objects in the input sequence.

To transform the test input sequence `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]`, we need to apply the same operations as in the examples above. Here's the transformed output sequence:

Transformed output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
