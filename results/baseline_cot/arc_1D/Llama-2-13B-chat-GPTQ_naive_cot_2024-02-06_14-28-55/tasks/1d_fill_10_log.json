The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing different pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nFrom the examples, we can see that the transformations involve moving objects (represented by the integer values) around, resizing them, and changing their color. The transformations seem to be applied in a specific pattern, where objects that are next to each other in the input sequence are affected by the same transformation.\n\nTo describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs, we can identify the following patterns:\n\n* Objects are moved horizontally by a fixed number of positions.\n* Objects are resized by a factor of 2 or 3.\n* Objects change color based on their original color and the position they are moved to.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences. To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color.\n2. Move objects horizontally by a fixed number of positions.\n3. Resize objects by a factor of 2 or 3.\n4. Change the color of objects based on their original color and the position they are moved to.\n\nHere is an example of how to apply these steps to the given test case input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color.\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (colors: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\n* Object 2: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (colors: 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\n\nStep 2: Move objects horizontally by a fixed number of positions.\n\n* Object 1: Move left by 2 positions (new position: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n* Object 2: Move right by 2 positions (new position: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\nStep 3: Resize objects by a factor of 2 or 3.\n\n* Object 1: Resize by a factor of 2 (new size: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)\n* Object 2: Resize by a factor of 3 (new size: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)\n\nStep 4: Change the color of objects based on their original color and the position they are moved to.\n\n* Object 1: Change color to 3 (new color: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)\n* Object 2: Change color to 2 (new color: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)\n\nOutput sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the test output sequence would be:\n\n['3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n\nI hope this helps!
