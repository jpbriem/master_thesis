The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my understanding of the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., 1 pixel).\n\t+ Resizing: Pixels can change size, either growing or shrinking by a fixed amount (e.g., 2 pixels).\n\t+ Color changing: Pixels can change color, either to a new color or back to the background color (0).\n\t+ Removal: Pixels can be removed entirely.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be randomly set to a noise value (e.g., 8).\n* Arithmetic operations: The output sequence can be generated by applying arithmetic operations to the input sequence, such as counting the number of pixels of each color, sorting the pixels by color, or calculating the distance between pixels.\n* Conditional logic: The transformation can be conditioned on certain criteria, such as the color of the pixels or the distance between them.\n\nWith this understanding, let me analyze the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI observe the following objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 9, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3} (a group of three pixels with color 9)\n* Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2} (a group of two pixels with color 9)\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 3} (a group of three pixels with color 0)\n\nNow, let me apply the transformation pattern to generate the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence contains the same objects as the input sequence, but with some transformations applied:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 9, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3} becomes {color: 9, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3, moved: 2 pixels right}\n* Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2} becomes {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2, moved: 1 pixel down}\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 3} becomes {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 3, moved: 2 pixels left}\n\nNote that the noise pixels (marked in red) have been removed, and the output sequence has been sorted by color.\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this input-output pair is:\n\n* Move objects by a fixed amount (up to 2 pixels) in the horizontal or vertical direction.\n* Resize objects by a fixed amount (up to 2 pixels) in the horizontal or vertical direction.\n* Change object color to a new color or back to the background color (0).\n* Remove noise pixels.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with other input-output pairs."
