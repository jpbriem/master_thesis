You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, changing size, and sometimes disappearing or appearing. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we see three objects of colors 2, 3, and 2. Object 1 (color 2) moves one position to the right, while object 2 (color 3) disappears and reappears two positions to the left. Object 3 (color 2) remains stationary but changes size from 2 to 3 pixels wide.

Example 2:
Here, we have four objects of colors 4, 4, 4, and 0. Objects 1 and 2 (colors 4) move one position to the right, while object 3 (color 4) disappears and reappears two positions to the left. Object 4 (color 0) appears at the end of the sequence.

Example 3:
In this example, there are five objects of colors 3, 5, 5, 5, and 0. Objects 1 and 2 (colors 3 and 5) move one position to the right, while object 3 (color 5) changes size from 5 to 3 pixels wide. Object 4 (color 0) appears at the beginning of the sequence, and object 5 (color 0) disappears.

Based on these patterns, here's what I would do to transform the given input sequence:

Input: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 1: Move object 1 (color 4) one position to the right: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Step 2: Remove object 2 (color 0): [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Step 3: Resize object 3 (color 5) from 5 to 3 pixels wide: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 4, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Step 4: Move object 4 (color 5) one position to the left: [0, 4, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Step 5: Add object 5 (color 0) at the end: [0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

And here's the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format:
```python
import numpy as np

# Test output sequence
output = np.array([0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0])
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
