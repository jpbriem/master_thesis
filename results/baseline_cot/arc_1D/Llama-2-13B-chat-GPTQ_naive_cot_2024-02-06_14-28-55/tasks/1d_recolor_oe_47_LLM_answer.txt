[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.

From the examples, we can see that the transformations involve moving objects (represented by changes in position), resizing objects (represented by changes in size), and changing the color of objects (represented by changes in color). Additionally, there may be noise pixels added to the output sequence.

To solve this task, we need to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences. One way to do this is to examine the patterns in the examples and try to identify any commonalities or regularities.

For example, looking at Example_1, we can see that the input sequence consists of alternating bands of blue and red pixels, while the output sequence has these bands shifted horizontally and expanded or contracted in size. Specifically, the blue pixels are moved one position to the right and expanded to twice their original size, while the red pixels are moved two positions to the left and shrunk to half their original size.

Similarly, looking at Example_2, we can see that the input sequence consists of alternating bands of blue and red pixels, while the output sequence has these bands rotated by 90 degrees and expanded or contracted in size. Specifically, the blue pixels are rotated 90 degrees clockwise and expanded to twice their original size, while the red pixels are rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise and shrunk to half their original size.

Finally, looking at Example_3, we can see that the input sequence consists of alternating bands of blue and red pixels, while the output sequence has these bands translated by one pixel to the right and expanded or contracted in size. Specifically, the blue pixels are translated one pixel to the right and expanded to twice their original size, while the red pixels are translated one pixel to the left and shrunk to half their original size.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a combination of translation, scaling, and rotation. Specifically, the output sequence is obtained by applying the following transformations to the input sequence:

* Translation: Move each object one pixel to the right (or left) in the output sequence.
* Scaling: Scale each object by a factor of 2 (or 1/2) in the output sequence.
* Rotation: Rotate each object by 90 degrees clockwise (or counterclockwise) in the output sequence.

Using this understanding of the transformation pattern, we can now transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence. Here is the description of the transformation in JSON format:

{
"description": {
"Object_1": {"color": 2, "start_index": 1, "end_index": 2, "size": 2},
"Object_2": {"color": 3, "start_index": 4, "end_index": 5, "size": 1}
},
"overall_pattern": "combination of translation, scaling, and rotation",
"instructions": "apply the following transformations to the input sequence: translation by 1 pixel to the right, scaling by 2, and rotation by 90 degrees clockwise.",
"transformation": {
"input": "[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
"object_description": ["Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}", "Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1}"],
"transformed_objects": ["Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 4}", "Object_2: {color: 6, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}"],
"output": "[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}

And here is the test output sequence in numpy array format:

numpy.array([0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
