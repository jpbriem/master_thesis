prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing their color.

For the given input sequence `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis:

* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color 3 (represented by the numbers 3) and one object of color 0 (represented by the number 0). The objects are located at positions 1-3, 5-6, and 8-9, respectively.
* Transformations: To apply the transformation pattern, we need to consider the relationships between the objects and their properties, such as distance, alignment, and overlap.

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, we can deduce the following transformations for the input sequence:

1. Move object 1 (color 3) to position 0: This creates a new object of color 3 at the beginning of the sequence.
2. Resize object 2 (color 3) to size 2: This doubles the size of the second object of color 3.
3. Remove object 3 (color 0): Since there is no more object of color 0 after the transformation, this object is removed from the sequence.
4. Copy object 1 (color 3) to position 4: This creates a new object of color 3 at position 4.
5. Scale object 2 (color 3) to size 3: This triples the size of the second object of color 3.
6. Recolor object 1 (color 3) to color 9: This changes the color of the first object of color 3 to 9.
7. Sort objects by size: Since the objects are now of different sizes, they need to be sorted accordingly.

After applying these transformations, the resulting output sequence would be:
```json
['0', '9', '9', '9', '9', '9', '0', '3', '3', '0', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '0', '0', '0']
```
As you can see, the output sequence has undergone significant changes compared to the original input sequence. By analyzing the patterns in the examples and applying the appropriate transformations, we were able to generate the correct output sequence.
