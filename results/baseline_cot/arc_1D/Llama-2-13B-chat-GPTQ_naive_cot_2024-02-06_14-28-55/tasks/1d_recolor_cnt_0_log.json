The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them up or down, and changing their color. Additionally, there may be some noise pixels added to the output sequence.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the input and output sequences for Example_1:\n\nInput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]\n\nFrom this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 2, with some gaps where there are no pixels (represented by 0). The output sequence has undergone several changes:\n\n* Some pixels have been moved to different positions in the sequence. For example, the two pixels with value 2 in the input sequence are now located at positions 1 and 8 in the output sequence.\n* Some pixels have been scaled up or down. For example, the three pixels with value 2 in the input sequence are now represented by five pixels with value 5 in the output sequence.\n* Some pixels have had their color changed. For example, the single pixel with value 0 in the input sequence is now represented by five pixels with value 5 in the output sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer that the transformation pattern involves moving objects, scaling them up or down, and changing their color. We will need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and determine the appropriate transformation to apply to each one.\n\nNow, let's turn our attention to the test case input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nTo begin, let's describe the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\nObject 3: {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 3}\n\nNext, we need to determine the appropriate transformation to apply to each object. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, we can make the following predictions:\n\nObject 1: Move to position 1, scale up to size 8, and change color to 5.\nObject 2: Move to position 4, scale up to size 8, and change color to 5.\nObject 3: Remove (as it has a value of 0).\n\nWith these transformations applied, the test case input sequence would become:\n\nTransformed Input: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0]\n\nFinally, we need to create the output sequence. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, we can expect to see some noise pixels added to the output sequence. Let's add five noise pixels with random values between 0 and 2 to the transformed input sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2]\n\nTherefore, the output sequence for the test case input sequence is [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2]."
