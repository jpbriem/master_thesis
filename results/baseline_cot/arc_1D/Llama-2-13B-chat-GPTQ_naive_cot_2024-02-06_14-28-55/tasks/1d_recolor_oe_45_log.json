The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of the three examples:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 10, consisting of alternating colors (0 and 7). We can identify four objects in the input sequence: two objects of color 0, each with size 5, and two objects of color 7, each with size 3. The output sequence consists of the original input sequence, but with each object shifted one position to the right. This means that the objects of color 0 have moved one position to the right, while the objects of color 7 have shrunk by one position.\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 8, consisting of alternating colors (0 and 7). We can identify three objects in the input sequence: one object of color 0, with size 4, and two objects of color 7, each with size 2. The output sequence consists of the original input sequence, but with each object scaled up by a factor of 2. This means that the object of color 0 has doubled in size, while the objects of color 7 have also doubled in size.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 6, consisting of alternating colors (0 and 7). We can identify two objects in the input sequence: one object of color 0, with size 3, and one object of color 7, with size 2. The output sequence consists of the original input sequence, but with each object rotated by 90 degrees clockwise. This means that the object of color 0 has been rotated by 90 degrees, while the object of color 7 has also been rotated by 90 degrees.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. The specific operations applied to each object may include moving, scaling, rotating, or removing objects.\n\nNow, let me analyze the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nWe can identify three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color 0, each with size 3, and one object of color 7, with size 4.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into the corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the appropriate operations to each object. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, we can assume that the operations applied to each object will involve moving, scaling, or rotating the objects.\n\nHere's my proposed transformation for the test case:\n\nObject 1 (color 0, size 3): Move one position to the right.\nObject 2 (color 0, size 3): Move one position to the right.\nObject 3 (color 7, size 4): Scale up by a factor of 2.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the objects in the input sequence have been moved or scaled up to create the corresponding output sequence. Specifically, the objects of color 0 have been moved one position to the right, while the object of color 7 has been scaled up by a factor of 2."
