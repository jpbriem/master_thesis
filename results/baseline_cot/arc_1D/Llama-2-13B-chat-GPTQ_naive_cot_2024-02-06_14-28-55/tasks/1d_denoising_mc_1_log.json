The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 9, representing different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.\n* The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of predefined rules.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here are the predefined rules:\n\n1. Objects can move horizontally (left or right) by at most one pixel.\n2. Objects can change their color by replacing all instances of the original color with a new color.\n3. Objects can shrink or grow in size by at most one pixel.\n4. Noise pixels can appear or disappear randomly.\n\nNow, let me apply these rules to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, I'll identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\nObject 2: [8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\nNext, I'll apply the transformation rules:\n\n1. Object 1 moves left by one pixel, so its new position is [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3].\n2. Object 2 changes color from 8 to 4, so its new position is [4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3].\n3. Both objects shrink by one pixel, so their new sizes are 2 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.\n4. Noise pixels appear randomly, so the final output sequence is:\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation from input to output is:\n\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'Objects move and change color, while noise pixels appear randomly', 'Example_2': '...', 'overall_pattern': 'objects move, change color, and shrink, while noise pixels appear randomly', 'instructions': 'apply the defined transformation rules to the input sequence', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description':'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
