The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and the description of the input-output relationship, it seems that the task involves applying a series of transformations to the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence.\n\nHere's my understanding of the input-output relationship based on the examples provided:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence has a specific color (represented by a number from 0 to 8) and a specific size (represented by the number of pixels it occupies).\n* Objects of the same color are considered to be part of the same object group, and they can be moved, resized, or rotated together.\n* Objects can also be copied, removed, or replaced with objects of different colors.\n* The output sequence contains the same number of objects as the input sequence, but their positions, sizes, and colors may have been modified.\n\nBased on these observations, here's an outline of the steps involved in transforming the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\n1. Identify object groups in the input sequence based on their color.\n2. Apply transformations to each object group, such as moving, resizing, rotating, copying, removing, or replacing objects.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the desired output sequence is obtained.\n\nTo perform the actual transformation, we need to write code that can identify object groups, apply transformations to them, and repeat the process until the output sequence is generated. Here's some sample Python code that could accomplish this task:\n```python\ndef transform_sequence(input_seq):\n    # Step 1: Identify object groups in the input sequence\n    obj_groups = []\n    for i in range(len(input_seq)):\n        if input_seq[i] == 0:\n            continue\n        obj_groups.append([i])\n        while input_seq[i]!= 0:\n            obj_groups[-1].append(i)\n    # Step 2: Apply transformations to each object group\n    for i, obj_group in enumerate(obj_groups):\n        # Move objects of the same color together\n        for j in range(len(obj_group)):\n            if obj_group[j]!= 0:\n                for k in range(j+1, len(obj_group)):\n                    if obj_group[k] == obj_group[j]:\n                        obj_group[k] = obj_group[j]\n        # Resize objects\n        for j in range(len(obj_group)):\n            if obj_group[j]!= 0:\n                obj_group[j] *= 2\n        # Rotate objects\n        for j in range(len(obj_group)):\n            if obj_group[j]!= 0:\n                obj_group[j] += 1\n    # Step 3: Generate the output sequence\n    output_seq = []\n    for obj_group in obj_groups:\n        output_seq.extend(obj_group)\n    return output_seq\n\n# Test cases\nprint(transform_sequence([0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, "
