You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, changing size, and sometimes disappearing or appearing. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we see four objects (colors 7 and 4) that move horizontally and change size. Objects 7 and 4 move towards the right, while object 7 grows in size and object 4 shrinks. The background color changes from 0 to 7.

Example 2:
Here, we have three objects (colors 1, 4, and 0) that move vertically and change size. Objects 1 and 4 move downwards, while object 4 grows in size and object 1 shrinks. The background color changes from 0 to 1.

Example 3:
In this example, we see six objects (colors 6 and 7) that move diagonally and change size. Objects 6 and 7 move towards the bottom-right corner, while object 6 grows in size and object 7 shrinks. The background color changes from 0 to 6.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to objects in the input sequence, such as movement, resizing, and disappearance/appearance. These operations seem to be governed by certain conditions or rules, but they are not explicitly stated in the task description.

Now, let's analyze the given test input sequence:

input: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This input sequence consists of eight elements, with the first two elements being 0 and 6, respectively. The next four elements are all 4, and the final two elements are 0.

To apply the transformation pattern to this input sequence, we need to identify the objects in the sequence. Based on the examples provided, it seems that objects can have any of the following properties:

* Color: one of the nine colors represented in the input sequence (0, 1, 2,..., 8)
* Size: determined by the number of consecutive elements with the same color
* Position: determined by the index of the element in the sequence

Using these criteria, we can identify the objects in the input sequence as follows:

Object 1: [0, 6] - color 0, size 2, position 0-1
Object 2: [4, 4] - color 4, size 2, position 2-3
Object 3: [4, 4] - color 4, size 2, position 4-5
Object 4: [4, 4] - color 4, size 2, position 6-7

With these objects identified, we can now apply the transformation pattern to them. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the following operations may be applied to objects:

* Move: objects can move left, right, up, or down by a certain number of positions
* Resize: objects can grow or shrink in size by a certain amount
* Disappear/Appear: objects can appear or disappear from the sequence

Using these operations, we can transform the input sequence as follows:

Object 1: move left by 1 position, resize by 2 units, keep color 0
Object 2: move right by 2 positions, resize by 2 units, keep color 4
Object 3: move down by 2 positions, resize by 2 units, keep color 4
Object 4: move right by 2 positions, resize by 2 units, keep color 4

After applying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:

output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As expected, the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and it contains the same objects as the input sequence, but with different sizes and positions. The background color has also changed from 0 to 7.

Therefore, based on the examples provided and the transformation pattern inferred, the needed transformation action to transform a new input into its output would be to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color, size, and position.
2. Apply the following operations to each object: move, resize, disappear/appear, depending on the condition specified in the task.
3. Output the transformed sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
