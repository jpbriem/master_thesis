            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my understanding of the patterns and rules that govern the transformation from input to output:\n\n* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each represented by a contiguous sequence of pixels with the same color. These objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, or changing color.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be labeled as noise pixels and are unaffected by any transformations.\n* Arithmetic operations: The output sequence may involve arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, or summing up the object sizes.\n* Conditional logic: The transformations may be conditioned upon certain criteria, such as the distance between objects or their overlapping areas.\n\nNow, let me describe the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of objects with distinct colors (0, 5, 9), while the output sequence features larger objects with more uniform colors (6, 6, 6). This suggests that the transformation involves combining smaller objects into larger ones, possibly through a process of merging or aggregation.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFor this example, the input sequence contains four identical objects with color 4, while the output sequence features larger objects with more uniform color 9. This suggests that the transformation involves replacing smaller objects with larger ones of the same color.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this case, the input sequence consists solely of a single object with color 4, while the output sequence features three identical objects with color 1. This suggests that the transformation involves creating new objects from a single original object.\n\nNow, given the test input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, I will apply the above-described transformation rules to generate the expected output sequence. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Objects: The input sequence contains several objects with colors 2 and 4.\n2. Noise pixels: None.\n3. Arithmetic operations: Not applicable.\n4. Conditional logic: Not applicable.\n\nBased on these observations, I expect the output sequence to feature larger objects with more uniform colors, possibly through a combination of merging and resizing. Here's my predicted output sequence:\n\n`output = [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nPlease note that this is just my interpretation of the transformation rules based on the examples provided. If there are any discrepancies or additional requirements, please feel free to clarify or provide further guidance."
