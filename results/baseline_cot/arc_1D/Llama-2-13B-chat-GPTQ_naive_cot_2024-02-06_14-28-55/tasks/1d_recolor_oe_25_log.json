            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nNow, let me analyze the patterns in the input sequence:\n\n* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each consisting of a group of adjacent pixels with the same color. For example, there are five objects of color 5, each consisting of 5 pixels.\n* Noise pixels: There are also some noise pixels scattered throughout the input sequence, represented by the value 0.\n* Arithmetic operations: It appears that the objects in the input sequence undergo some arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication. For example, the object of color 5 at index 1 is multiplied by 2 to produce an object of color 10 at index 2. Similarly, the object of color 5 at index 4 is added to the object of color 5 at index 6 to produce an object of color 10 at index 7.\n\nBased on these observations, I can infer that the goal of the transformation is to modify the objects in the input sequence according to specific rules, possibly involving arithmetic operations.\n\nNow, let me describe the desired transformation for the input sequence you provided:\n\nTransformed Output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere's a step-by-step description of the transformation:\n\n1. Object of color 5 at index 1: Multiply by 2 to produce an object of color 10 at index 2.\n2. Object of color 5 at index 4: Add to the object of color 5 at index 6 to produce an object of color 10 at index 7.\n3. Object of color 5 at index 8: Multiply by 2 to produce an object of color 10 at index 9.\n4. Noise pixels at indices 2 and 4: Replace with objects of color 8.\n5. Remaining noise pixels: Replace with objects of color 0.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence is obtained by applying the above rules to the input sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
