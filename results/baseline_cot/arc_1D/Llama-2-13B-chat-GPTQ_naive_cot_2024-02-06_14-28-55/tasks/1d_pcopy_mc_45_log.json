The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* Input: A 1D sequence of integers representing pixel colors (0 for background, 1-9 for different object colors).\n* Output: A 1D sequence of integers representing the corresponding pixel colors after applying the transformation rules.\n* Transformation rules:\n\t+ Objects can move, change size, or change color.\n\t+ Noise pixels can be added or removed.\n\t+ Arithmetical operations can be applied to object properties (e.g., counting, sorting).\n\t+ Conditional rules can be applied based on object properties or positions.\n\nTo solve this task, I would suggest starting by carefully analyzing each example and identifying the specific patterns and rules that govern the transformation between the input and output sequences. Here are some observations based on the examples provided:\n\n* Objects can move horizontally or vertically, and their sizes can increase or decrease.\n* Objects can change color, and new objects can be introduced or existing ones can be removed.\n* Noise pixels can be added or removed, and they seem to follow a specific pattern based on the object colors.\n* Arithmetical operations can be applied to object properties, such as counting or sorting.\n* Conditional rules can be applied based on object properties or positions.\n\nWith these observations in mind, here's my proposed approach for solving this task:\n\n1. Analyze each example and identify the specific patterns and rules governing the transformation between the input and output sequences.\n2. Create a set of general rules that capture the common patterns and relationships observed across all examples.\n3. Use these rules to transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nHere's the description of the input and output sequences in JSON format, as requested:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nNow, please provide me with the actual input sequence, and I will apply the transformation rules to generate the corresponding output sequence."
