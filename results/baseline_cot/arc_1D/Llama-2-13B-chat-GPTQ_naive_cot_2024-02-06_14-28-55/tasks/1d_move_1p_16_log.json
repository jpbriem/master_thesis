The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining and manipulating objects of the same color. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have two objects of color 2, one with size 2 and the other with size 1. The output sequence simply copies the input sequence without any changes. Therefore, the transformation pattern here is simply \"no operation\" or \"do nothing\".\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have three objects of color 5, each with size 5. The output sequence moves the second object one position to the right and removes the third object. This can be described as \"move (object 2) by 1 position to the right\" and \"remove (object 3)\".\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have four objects of color 5, each with size 5. The output sequence scales down the second and fourth objects by a factor of 2 and moves the third object one position to the left. This can be described as \"scale (object 2) by 2\" and \"move (object 3) by -1 position to the left\".\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves simple operations such as moving, scaling, and removing objects of the same color.\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case input sequence you provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis input sequence consists of nine zeros and four objects of color 4, each with size 4. To transform this input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply the transformation pattern described above.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: Color 4, size 4, starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.\n* Object 2: Color 4, size 4, starting at index 4 and ending at index 7.\n* Object 3: Color 4, size 4, starting at index 8 and ending at index 11.\n* Object 4: Color 4, size 4, starting at index 12 and ending at index 15.\n\nNow, let me apply the transformation pattern to this input sequence:\n\n1. Move (Object 2) by 1 position to the right:\n\t* New position: 5-4=1 (index 5)\n2. Remove (Object 3):\n\t* Removed object: [4, 4, 4, 4] (index 8-11)\n3. Scale (Object 4) by 2:\n\t* New size: 2 x 4 = 8 (index 12-15)\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, applying the transformation pattern to the input sequence resulted in the desired output sequence.\n\nTo summarize, the transformation pattern for this task involves moving, scaling, and removing objects of the same color. In this specific case, we had four objects of color 4, each with size 4, and we applied the following operations to transform them into their corresponding output objects:\n\n1. Moved Object 2 one position to the right.\n2. Removed Object 3.\n3. Scaled Object 4 by a factor of 2."
