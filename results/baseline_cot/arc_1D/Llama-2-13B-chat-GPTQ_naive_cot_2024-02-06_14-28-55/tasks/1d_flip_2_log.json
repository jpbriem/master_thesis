The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence consists of a series of pixels, each represented by a number from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and 1-9 represent different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example, if two consecutive pixels have the same color, they form an object.\n* The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of predefined rules. These rules involve object transformations such as moving, resizing, rotating, and copying objects.\n* The output sequence should also consist of pixels represented by numbers from 0 to 9, where each pixel corresponds to a specific object in the input sequence.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here's the pattern I observed:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence can undergo one of several transformations, including moving, resizing, rotating, and copying.\n* The transformations are applied in a specific order, starting with the first object in the sequence.\n* Once all objects have been transformed, the resulting objects are concatenated to create the output sequence.\n\nNow, let me explain how I would approach the task of transforming the given input sequence into its output sequence. Here are the steps I would follow:\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence\nThe first step is to identify the objects in the input sequence. Since adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects, we need to find contiguous runs of pixels with the same color. We can do this by iterating over the input sequence and checking whether each pixel has the same color as its neighbors. If we find a run of pixels with the same color, we add it to our list of objects.\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to objects\nOnce we have identified the objects in the input sequence, we need to apply the appropriate transformations to each object. This involves moving, resizing, rotating, and copying objects as necessary. We can use a combination of arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) and modular arithmetic (e.g., dividing by 9) to implement these transformations.\n\nStep 3: Concatenate transformed objects\nAfter applying transformations to each object, we need to concatenate the resulting objects to create the output sequence. We can simply append each transformed object to the output sequence, ensuring that we maintain the correct ordering of objects.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements these steps:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_sequence(input_seq):\n    # Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence\n    objects = []\n    for i in range(len(input_seq)):\n        curr_color = input_seq[i]\n        if i < len(input_seq) - 1 and input_seq[i + 1] == curr_color:\n            objects.append([i, curr_color])\n\n    # Step 2: Apply transformations to objects\n    for obj in objects:\n        # Move objects\n        if obj[1] == 4:\n            obj[0] += 1\n        # Resize objects\n        elif obj[1] == 5:\n            obj[0] *= 2\n        # Rotate objects\n        elif obj[1] == 7:\n            obj[0] = (obj[0] + 1) % 9\n        # Copy objects\n        elif obj[1] == 3:\n            obj.append((obj[0], obj[1]))\n\n    # Step 3: Concatenate transformed objects\n    output_seq = np.array([])\n    for obj in objects:\n        output_seq = np.concatenate((output_seq, obj), axis=0)\n\n    return output_seq\n\n# Test cases\nprint(transform_sequence([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,"
