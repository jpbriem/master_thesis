            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 9, representing different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.\n* The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of predefined rules.\n\nBased on the examples given, here are some observations about the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, resizing, rotating, and changing color.\n* Noise pixels can be added or removed from the output sequence.\n* Arithmetical operations can be performed on objects and their properties, such as counting, sorting, and summing.\n* Conditional logic can be applied to determine the outcome of these operations.\n\nNow, let me describe the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\nOutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\nNow, let me explain how I would approach the task of transforming the input sequence into the output sequence. Here are the steps I would follow:\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence.\n\nFrom the input sequence, we can identify the following objects:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] (color 2)\n* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9] (color 9)\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to objects.\n\nBased on the examples provided, we can apply the following transformations to the objects:\n\n* Object 1: Move (2 positions to the right), resize (double the size), change color (to color 9).\n* Object 2: Move (1 position to the left), resize (triple the size), change color (to color 2).\n\nStep 3: Add noise pixels.\n\nWe can add random noise pixels to the output sequence to simulate the appearance of imperfections in the image.\n\nStep 4: Perform arithmetical operations.\n\nWe can perform arithmetical operations on the objects and their properties to create interesting patterns and effects. For example, we could count the number of objects of each color and display the results.\n\nStep 5: Apply conditional logic.\n\nWe can apply conditional logic to determine the outcome of the arithmetical operations based on certain conditions. For example, if the number of objects of color 2 is greater than the number of objects of color 9, we could display a message indicating that color 2 is more popular.\n\nWith these steps in mind, I will now provide the transformation for the test input sequence:\n\nTest Input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTransformation:\n\n1. Identify objects:\n\t* Object 1: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5] (color 8)\n\t* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2] (color 2)\n2. Apply transformations:\n\t* Object 1: Move (2 positions to the right), resize (double the size), change color (to color 9).\n\t* Object 2: Move (1 position to the left), resize (triple the size), change color (to color 2).\n3. Add noise pixels:\n\t* Randomly add noise pixels to the output sequence.\n4. Perform arithmetical operations:\n\t* Count the number of objects of each color and display the results.\n5. Apply conditional logic:\n\t* If the number of objects of color 2 is greater than the number of objects of color 9, display a message indicating that color 2 is more popular.\n\nAnd there you have it! That's how I would approach the task of transforming the input sequence into the output sequence based on the given pattern."
