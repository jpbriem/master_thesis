            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and copying them.\n\nFor Example_1, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and ones, where each run of zeros corresponds to a background color (0) and each run of ones corresponds to an object color (2). The output sequence simply duplicates each object, so that each run of ones becomes two runs of ones. This transformation can be described as \"move\" or \"scale\", since each object is duplicated without any changes to its position or size.\n\nFor Example_2, the input sequence contains a mix of zeros and fours, where the fours represent objects. The output sequence replaces each four with four copies of itself, effectively multiplying the number of objects in each run. This transformation can be described as \"copy\" or \"multiply\".\n\nFor Example_3, the input sequence consists of a series of threes, with no background color (0) present. The output sequence simply adds three to each number, effectively increasing the size of each object. This transformation can be described as \"add\" or \"increment\".\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying simple arithmetic operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as addition, multiplication, movement, or scaling. The specific operation applied to each object depends on the value of the object and the context of the surrounding objects.\n\nNow, let's consider the given test case:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\nTo apply the transformation pattern to this input, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. We can see that there are several runs of ones and fives, which correspond to objects with colors 1 and 5, respectively. The background color is 0.\n\nNext, we need to determine the appropriate transformation operation for each object. Since there are no background colors present, we can simply apply the transformation operations directly to the objects.\n\nFor the first object (5), we can apply the \"scale\" operation, since we want to multiply the number of objects in each run. Therefore, the first object should become 5 x 2 = 10.\n\nFor the second object (0), we can apply the \"remove\" operation, since we don't want to include this object in the output sequence. Therefore, the second object should be removed entirely.\n\nFor the third object (5), we can apply the \"move\" operation, since we want to move this object one position to the right. Therefore, the third object should become 6.\n\nFinally, we can create the output sequence by concatenating the transformed objects: [0, 0, 5, 10, 6].\n\nHere's the complete description of the transformation pattern and the test case in JSON format, as requested:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"....\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"object_description\": \"regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to elaborate on any aspect of the transformation pattern or the test case."
