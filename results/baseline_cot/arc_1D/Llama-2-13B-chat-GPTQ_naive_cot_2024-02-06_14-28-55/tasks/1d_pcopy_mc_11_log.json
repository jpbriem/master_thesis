The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns in the input-output pairs:\n\n* Example_1: In this example, the input sequence has two objects of color 2, one object of color 5, and one object of color 0. The output sequence has five objects of color 2, one object of color 5, and no objects of color 0. The transformation appears to be moving objects of color 2 closer together, while keeping objects of color 5 separate.\n* Example_2: In this example, the input sequence has three objects of color 5, one object of color 0, and no objects of color 2. The output sequence has five objects of color 5, one object of color 9, and no objects of color 0 or 2. The transformation appears to be scaling objects of color 5 up by a factor of 3, while introducing a new object of color 9.\n* Example_3: In this example, the input sequence has four objects of color 9, one object of color 0, and no objects of color 2 or 5. The output sequence has nine objects of color 9, with each object overlapping the previous one by half. The transformation appears to be duplicating objects of color 9 multiple times.\n\nBased on these patterns, it seems that the transformation involves applying operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as movement, scaling, and duplication, to produce the output sequence.\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation for the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere's how I would describe the transformation:\n\n1. Move all objects of color 2 towards the left by 2 positions.\n2. Scale all objects of color 5 up by a factor of 3.\n3. Introduce a new object of color 6 at the rightmost position.\n4. Remove all objects of color 0.\n5. Move all objects of color 4 towards the right by 1 position.\n\nAnd here's the transformed output sequence:\n\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
