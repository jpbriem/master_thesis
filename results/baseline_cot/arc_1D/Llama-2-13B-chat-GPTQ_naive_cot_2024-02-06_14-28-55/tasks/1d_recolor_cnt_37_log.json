The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4]\noutput: [0, 7, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing their color. Additionally, there are some noise pixels that need to be taken into account.\n\nTo describe the transformation pattern in more detail, here are some observations:\n\n* Objects can move horizontally (left or right) by a certain number of pixels.\n* Objects can change size (grow or shrink) by a certain amount.\n* Objects can change color.\n* Noise pixels can appear or disappear.\n\nBased on these observations, we can deduce that the transformation pattern involves applying a series of operations to the objects in the input sequence, where each operation modifies one or more objects in some way.\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at the test input sequence you provided:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere's how I would describe the objects in this input sequence:\n\nObject 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 4} (a blue object starting at index 0 and ending at index 4, with a size of 4 pixels)\n\nObject 2: {color: 0, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 3} (a blue object starting at index 5 and ending at index 8, with a size of 3 pixels)\n\nObject 3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 3} (a blue object starting at index 9 and ending at index 12, with a size of 3 pixels)\n\nNoise pixel: {color: 0, start_index: 13, end_index: 14} (a single noise pixel at index 13-14)\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation pattern to this input sequence. Here's what the output sequence might look like:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n\nHere's how I would describe the objects in the output sequence:\n\nObject 1: {color: 2, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 4} (a red object starting at index 0 and ending at index 4, with a size of 4 pixels)\n\nObject 2: {color: 2, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 3} (a red object starting at index 5 and ending at index 8, with a size of 3 pixels)\n\nObject 3: {color: 2, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 3} (a red object starting at index 9 and ending at index 12, with a size of 3 pixels)\n\nNoise pixel: {color: 0, start_index: 13, end_index: 14} (a single noise pixel at index 13-14)\n\nAs you can see, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed into objects of a different color (red instead of blue), and they have also moved horizontally by a certain number of pixels. Additionally, there is a single noise pixel that has appeared in the output sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any of the points above."
