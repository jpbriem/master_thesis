The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions attached to these operations that determine when they should be applied.\n\nTo describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs, we can identify some common patterns:\n\n* Objects can move horizontally or vertically, or both.\n* Objects can change size, either growing or shrinking.\n* Objects can change color.\n* Objects can be removed or copied.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences. In general, the output sequence will consist of the original input sequence with objects moved, resized, or changed in some way.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the given test input sequence:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. We can see that there are six objects of color 6, each with a size of 2.\n\nNext, we need to determine what operations should be applied to each object. Based on the patterns we observed earlier, we can see that the objects should be moved, resized, and possibly changed in color.\n\nHere's the description of the transformed objects:\n\n* Object_1: Start index 1, end index 2, size 2, color 6.\n* Object_2: Start index 3, end index 4, size 2, color 6.\n* Object_3: Start index 5, end index 6, size 2, color 6.\n* Object_4: Start index 7, end index 8, size 2, color 6.\n* Object_5: Start index 9, end index 10, size 2, color 6.\n\nNow, let's apply the transformations to the input sequence:\n\n1. Move Object_1 one position to the right (from index 1 to index 2).\n2. Scale Object_2 by a factor of 2 in both the horizontal and vertical directions (from size 2 to size 4).\n3. Remove Object_3 and replace it with a new object of color 6 and size 2 at index 5.\n4. Copy Object_4 and paste it at index 7, but change its color to 6.\n5. Move Object_5 one position to the left (from index 9 to index 8).\n\nFinally, here's the resulting test output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence consists of the original input sequence with objects moved, resized, and changed in some way.\n\nI hope this helps!
