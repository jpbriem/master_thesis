            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of zeros and ones, where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. The output sequence consists of only zeros, indicating that all objects have been removed. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves removing objects that are entirely contained within another object (in this case, any object completely surrounded by pixels of the same color).\n\nExample 2:\nSimilarly, in Example 2, we have an input sequence of zeros and ones, but this time, the output sequence contains only ones. This indicates that the transformation pattern involves copying objects from the input sequence to the output sequence without any changes.\n\nExample 3:\nIn Example 3, we have an input sequence consisting solely of one color (in this case, color 6), and the output sequence consists of the same color, but with some pixels shifted to the right. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves moving objects in the input sequence to the right, while maintaining their original size and color.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as removal, copying, or movement. These operations seem to be conditioned on the properties of the objects themselves, rather than on arbitrary rules or conditions.\n\nNow, let me analyze the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this input sequence, we have several objects of color 5, each consisting of contiguous pixels of the same color. To apply the transformation pattern, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine the appropriate operation to apply to each one.\n\nObject 1: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] - This object consists of five consecutive pixels of color 5, and no other objects are contained within it. Therefore, according to the transformation pattern, we should remove this object from the input sequence.\n\nObject 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5] - This object consists of five consecutive pixels of color 5, and is not contained within any other objects. Therefore, we should copy this object to the output sequence without modification.\n\nObject 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - This object consists of no pixels of any color, and therefore does not require any transformation.\n\nOverall, the transformation pattern applied to the given input sequence would result in the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs requested, here is the description of the transformation in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"removing objects entirely contained within another object\",\n\"Example_2\": \"copying objects without change\",\n\"Example_3\": \"moving objects to the right while maintaining size and color\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"applying operations to objects based on their properties\",\n\"instructions\": \"identify objects in the input sequence and apply appropriate operations based on their properties\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"identify objects in the input sequence based on their color and size\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"apply appropriate operations to each object based on its properties\",\n\"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n\nI hope this helps!
