You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.

To begin, let me describe the input and output sequences for each example:

Example 1:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example 2:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example 3:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0]

Based on these examples, I observe the following patterns:

* Objects in the input sequence are assigned a unique color (0, 3, 8) and are moved, resized, or copied in the output sequence.
* Noise pixels (represented by 0) may appear in the output sequence, especially when objects overlap or are moved.
* Arithmetical operations (e.g., counting, sorting) are applied to the objects in the output sequence.

Now, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their unique colors (0, 3, 8).
2. Apply the following transformations to each object:
a. Move objects to adjacent positions (e.g., object with color 0 moves to position 1, object with color 3 moves to position 2, etc.).
b. Resize objects based on their original size and the distance between them (e.g., object with color 8 doubles in size if there is no object of the same color nearby).
c. Copy objects to create duplicates (e.g., object with color 3 is copied twice to create two identical objects).
3. Add noise pixels to simulate overlapping objects or movement.
4. Apply arithmetical operations (e.g., counting, sorting) to the objects in the output sequence.

With these instructions in mind, let me transform the given test input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence.

Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8] (color: 8)
Object 2: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] (color: 5)

Step 2: Apply transformations to each object.

Object 1: Move to position 1 (now at [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]).
Object 2: Copy twice (now at [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5]).

Step 3: Add noise pixels.

Add 5 noise pixels to the output sequence (now at [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]).

Step 4: Apply arithmetical operations.

Count the number of objects (now at [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]).

And there we have it! The transformed test output sequence is:

Output: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
