            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves making copies of certain objects, changing their sizes and positions, and sometimes removing or adding objects altogether. Additionally, there appears to be a focus on object relationships such as distance, alignment, and overlap.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis of the objects present in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: `color = 2`, `start_index = 1`, `end_index = 2`, `size = 2` (a two-pixel wide object)\n* Object 2: `color = 2`, `start_index = 3`, `end_index = 4`, `size = 1` (a one-pixel wide object)\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, I would expect the output sequence to involve the following transformations:\n\n1. Object 1 will be copied and pasted twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the sequence. This means that we will have three instances of Object 1 in the output sequence.\n2. Object 2 will be removed.\n3. A new object with `color = 2` and `size = 2` will be added to the middle of the sequence.\n\nHere's the expected output sequence:\n```json\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nTo create the output sequence, I would perform the following steps:\n\n1. Copy the first instance of Object 1 (starting from index 1) and paste it at the beginning of the sequence (at index 0).\n2. Copy the second instance of Object 1 (starting from index 2) and paste it at the end of the sequence (at index 8).\n3. Remove the third instance of Object 1 (starting from index 3).\n4. Add a new object with `color = 2` and `size = 2` at index 5.\n\nHere's the code to implement these transformations in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input sequence\ninput_sequence = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Define the desired output sequence\nexpected_output = [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Create a NumPy array to store the output sequence\noutput = np.array(expected_output)\n\n# Perform the transformations\nfor i in range(len(input_sequence)):\n    if input_sequence[i] == 2:\n        # Copy the first instance of Object 1 and paste it at the beginning\n        output[0] = input_sequence[0]\n        \n        # Copy the second instance of Object 1 and paste it at the end\n        output[-1] = input_sequence[-1]\n        \n        # Remove the third instance of Object 1\n        del output[1]\n        \n        # Add a new object with color 2 and size 2 at index 5\n        output[5] = 2\n\nreturn output\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
