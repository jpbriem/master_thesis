The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, I can see that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 4, representing different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example, [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with two objects: Object_1 (color 2) and Object_2 (color 3).\n* The output sequence is obtained by applying a set of transformations to the input sequence, including move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, and recolor.\n* The transformations are applied according to specific rules, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\n* Additionally, there may be noise pixels in the input sequence that need to be handled appropriately.\n\nTo solve this task, I will need to carefully analyze each example and identify the patterns and rules that govern the transformations between the input and output sequences. Once I have a good understanding of these patterns, I can use them to create a general solution that can handle any valid input sequence.\n\nHere's my plan of attack:\n\n1. Analyze each example and identify the patterns and rules governing the transformations.\n2. Create a general solution that can handle any valid input sequence.\n3. Test the solution on a variety of inputs to ensure it is correct and efficient.\n\nI will represent the input and output sequences as numpy arrays to facilitate manipulation and computation. I will also use descriptive variables to keep track of the objects in the input sequence and their properties, such as size, position, and color.\n\nLet's get started! Please provide the test input sequence, and I will begin by analyzing it and creating the corresponding output sequence."
