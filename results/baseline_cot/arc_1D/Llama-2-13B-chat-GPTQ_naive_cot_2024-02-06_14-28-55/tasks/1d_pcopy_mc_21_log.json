The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.\n\nHere's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* Input: A 1D sequence of integers representing pixel colors (0 for background, 1-9 for different object colors).\n* Output: A 1D sequence of integers representing the corresponding pixel colors after applying the transformation rules.\n* Transformation rules:\n\t+ Objects can move, change size, or change color.\n\t+ Noise pixels can be added or removed.\n\t+ Arithmetical operations can be applied to objects and noise pixels.\n* Test cases: Three examples are provided, each with a unique input and output sequence.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the first test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, here's my interpretation of the transformation rules:\n\n* Objects can move horizontally (left or right) by up to half their size.\n* Objects can change size by up to double their original size.\n* Objects can change color by up to three colors (red, green, blue).\n* Noise pixels can be added or removed randomly.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the given input sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence.\n\nObject 1: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4] (size: 4, color: 0)\nObject 2: [6, 0, 0, 0] (size: 1, color: 6)\n\nStep 2: Apply transformation rules.\n\nFor Object 1:\n\n* Move left by half size: [0, 0, 2, 2, 4] (size: 4, color: 0)\n\nFor Object 2:\n\n* Change size by doubling: [6, 0, 0, 0, 12] (size: 2, color: 6)\n\nNoise pixels: Add random noise pixels to the sequence.\n\nFinal output sequence: [0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 6, 0, 0, 12]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
