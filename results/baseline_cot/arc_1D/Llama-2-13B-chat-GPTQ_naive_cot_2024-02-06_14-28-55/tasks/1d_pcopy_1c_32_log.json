The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my understanding of the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., 2 pixels).\n\t+ Resizing: Pixels can change size by a factor (e.g., double or half the original size).\n\t+ Color changes: Pixels can change color, either to a new color or back to the background color (0).\n\t+ Overlapping: Pixels can overlap each other, causing one pixel to cover another.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be replaced by noise pixels (randomly chosen integer value between 1 and 9).\n* Arithmetic operations: Pixel values can be modified using basic arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) based on the object properties.\n\nNow, let me explain the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with consecutive colors (0, 5, 5, 5), and the output sequence has the same colors, but with some modifications:\n\n* Pixels have moved horizontally by 1-2 positions.\n* Some pixels have changed size, either doubling or halving their original size.\n* One pixel at position 5 has changed color from 5 to 0.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with consecutive colors (0, 2, 2, 2), and the output sequence has the same colors, but with some modifications:\n\n* Pixels have moved horizontally by 1-2 positions.\n* Some pixels have changed size, either doubling or halving their original size.\n* All pixels have changed color to 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with consecutive colors (0, 5, 5, 5), and the output sequence has the same colors, but with some modifications:\n\n* Pixels have moved horizontally by 1-2 positions.\n* Some pixels have changed size, either doubling or halving their original size.\n* All pixels have changed color to 5.\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation needed to transform the given input sequence into the corresponding output sequence:\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`:\n\n1. Move the first 7 pixels to the right by 2 positions.\n2. Double the size of the next 7 pixels.\n3. Change the color of the last 7 pixels to 5.\n4. Add noise to all pixels (randomly choose an integer value between 1 and 9).\n\nThe resulting output sequence would be:\n\n`[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
