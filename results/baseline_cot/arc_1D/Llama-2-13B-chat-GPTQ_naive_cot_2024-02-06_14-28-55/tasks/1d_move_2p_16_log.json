The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a set of logical rules that involve object transformations, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the input and output sequences. The input sequence is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This sequence consists of zeros and fours, with each four representing a object of a specific color (in this case, blue). The objects are separated by zero pixels, which represent the background color (black).\n\nThe output sequence is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This sequence consists entirely of zeros, indicating that all objects have been removed and replaced with background color pixels.\n\nNow, let's consider the transformation pattern that relates the input and output sequences. From the examples provided, we can see that the transformation involves several operations, including:\n\n1. Object movements: Objects can move horizontally or vertically, either by being shifted to a new location or by being copied and pasted elsewhere in the sequence.\n2. Object resizing: Objects can change size, either by growing or shrinking in size.\n3. Object removal: Objects can be removed completely from the sequence.\n4. Noise pixels: Pixels can be added to the sequence that do not belong to any object. These pixels are referred to as \"noise\" pixels.\n5. Arithmetic operations: Objects can undergo arithmetic operations, such as addition or multiplication, to modify their properties.\n6. Conditional logic: Transformations can be conditioned upon certain criteria, such as the presence or absence of other objects.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer that the transformation from input to output involves applying a series of operations to the input sequence, possibly in a conditional manner. The exact nature of these operations will depend on the specific requirements of each test case.\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation for the given test case. The input sequence is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. To transform this sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following operations:\n\n1. Move object #1 (color 4) one position to the right.\n2. Resize object #2 (color 4) to twice its original size.\n3. Remove object #3 (color 4).\n4. Add two noise pixels (color 0) to the beginning of the sequence.\n5. Apply a conditional operation to object #4 (color 4): if the object overlaps with object #2, multiply its size by 2; otherwise, leave it unchanged.\n\nAfter applying these operations, we obtain the output sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. As expected, all objects have been transformed into background color pixels.\n\nFinally, to create the test output sequence, we simply repeat the input sequence, but with the appropriate transformations applied. In this case, the test output sequence would be `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
