The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 4, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some sort of logical rules.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0\n\nBased on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves applying certain operations to the objects (pixels) in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color. The exact rules for these operations are not explicitly stated, but we can infer some patterns based on the examples:\n\n1. Objects of the same color are combined: In Example_1, objects of color 2 are combined into a single object of color 3. Similarly, in Example_2, objects of color 0 are combined into a single object of color 9.\n2. Objects are moved: In Example_1, objects of color 2 are moved one pixel to the right, while in Example_2, objects of color 0 are moved two pixels to the left.\n3. Objects are resized: In Example_1, objects of color 2 are doubled in size, while in Example_2, objects of color 0 are halved in size.\n4. Color changes occur: In Example_1, objects of color 2 change to color 3, while in Example_2, objects of color 0 change to color 9.\n\nWith these patterns in mind, let's analyze the test input sequence:\n\nTest Input Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0\n\nApplying the patterns observed in the examples, we can make the following observations about the test input sequence:\n\n1. There are four objects of color 4: One at index 0, one at index 4, one at index 8, and one at index 12.\n2. There are three objects of color 0: One at index 1, one at index 5, and one at index 9.\n3. All objects of color 4 are moved one pixel to the right, except for the object at index 0, which is not moved.\n4. All objects of color 0 are moved two pixels to the left.\n5. Objects of color 4 are doubled in size, while objects of color 0 are halved in size.\n6. Objects of color 4 change to color 3, while objects of color 0 change to color 9.\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation needed to convert the test input sequence into the test output sequence:\n\n1. Move the object of color 4 at index 0 one pixel to the right.\n2. Move the objects of color 0 at indices 1, 5, and 9 two pixels to the left.\n3. Double the size of all objects of color 4.\n4. Halve the size of all objects of color 0.\n5. Change the color of all objects of color 4 to color 3, and the color of all objects of color 0 to color 9.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the following test output sequence:\n\nTest Output Sequence:\n\n* Length: 18\n* Values: 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
