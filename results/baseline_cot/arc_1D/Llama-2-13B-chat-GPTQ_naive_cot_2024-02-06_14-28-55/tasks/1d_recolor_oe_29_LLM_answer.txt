You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the input and output sequences:

* Objects: The input sequence contains objects of different sizes and colors, represented by consecutive integers of the same color. For example, the object {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 4} represents a group of four pixels with color 7.
* Transformations: The output sequence applies various transformations to these objects, such as moving them horizontally or vertically, resizing them, or changing their color.
* Noise pixels: Some pixels in the output sequence have a value of 0, indicating that they are noise pixels and do not belong to any object.
* Arithmetic operations: The output sequence performs arithmetic operations on the objects, such as counting the number of pixels in each object or calculating the sum of the pixel values.
* Conditional logic: The output sequence includes conditional statements that determine the application of certain transformations based on the properties of the objects.

Based on these observations, I would suggest that the transformation pattern for the input-output pairs can be described as follows:

* Each object in the input sequence is transformed according to a set of rules based on its size, position, and color.
* These transformations include moving the object horizontally or vertically, resizing it, or changing its color.
* Noise pixels are added or removed from the output sequence based on certain conditions.
* Arithmetic operations are performed on the objects to calculate quantities such as the sum of the pixel values.
* Conditional statements determine the application of certain transformations based on the properties of the objects.

Now, let me describe the transformation for the given test input sequence:

Input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's how the transformation was applied:

1. Object {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 4}: moved horizontally by 3 pixels (from index 1 to index 4).
2. Object {color: 7, start_index: 5, end_index: 7}: resized to 6 pixels (from index 5 to index 7).
3. Object {color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 10}: moved vertically by 2 pixels (from index 8 to index 10).
4. Noise pixel at index 11: added.
5. Sum of pixel values: calculated and stored in the output sequence.

And here's the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format:

array([0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0])

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
