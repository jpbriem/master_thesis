            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns in the examples:\n\n* Objects: In each example, there are one or more objects (i.e., sequences of adjacent pixels) with specific properties such as size, position, and color. These objects can undergo various transformations such as moving, resizing, changing color, or being removed.\n* Noise pixels: There may be noise pixels in the input sequence that do not belong to any object. These pixels may remain unchanged or be modified according to some rule.\n* Arithmetic operations: The output sequence may involve arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, or summing up the pixel values.\n* Conditional rules: The transformation may be conditioned upon certain criteria such as the presence of specific objects, the distance between objects, or other factors.\n\nNow, let me analyze the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom the input, we can identify several objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 6, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 0, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, we can make the following assumptions about the transformation:\n\n* Objects will be moved, resized, or removed.\n* Noise pixels may be added or modified.\n* Arithmetic operations will be performed, possibly involving the object sizes and positions.\n* Conditional rules will apply based on the object properties and positions.\n\nTo transform the input sequence, we need to apply these assumptions in a systematic way. Here's my proposed transformation:\n\nOutput: [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Object 1: Move 2 units right and resize to 2x the original size.\n2. Object 2: Remove.\n3. Object 3: Add a new object at index 5 with color 0 and size 1.\n4. Noise pixels: Add 2 noise pixels at indices 2 and 4 with random colors.\n5. Arithmetic operations: Sum up the sizes of all objects and add 2 to the result.\n\nNote that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid transformations depending on the specific requirements of the task."
