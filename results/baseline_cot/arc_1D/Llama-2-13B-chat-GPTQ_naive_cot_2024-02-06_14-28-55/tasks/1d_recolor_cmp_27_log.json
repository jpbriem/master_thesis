The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]\noutput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 7, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some sort of logical rules or patterns.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\nOutput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 7, with some runs of consecutive 7s. The output sequence has the same structure, but with all the 0s replaced by 1s. This suggests that the transformation involves replacing any run of consecutive 0s with a single 1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists entirely of zeros and sevens, with no runs of consecutive values. The output sequence is similar, but with all the zeros replaced by ones. This suggests that the transformation involves replacing any value of 0 with a 1.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 7, with some runs of consecutive 7s. The output sequence has the same structure, but with all the 0s replaced by 1s and all the 7s replaced by 1s. This suggests that the transformation involves replacing any run of consecutive 0s with a single 1, and replacing any run of consecutive 7s with a single 1.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation involves replacing runs of consecutive values with a single value. Specifically, any run of consecutive 0s is replaced with a single 1, and any run of consecutive 7s is replaced with a single 1.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output. First, we need to identify any runs of consecutive values in the input sequence. If we find a run of consecutive 0s, we replace it with a single 1. If we find a run of consecutive 7s, we replace it with a single 1. We repeat this process until we have transformed the entire input sequence.\n\nFinally, here is the test output sequence based on the given input:\n\nInput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nTransformed Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."
