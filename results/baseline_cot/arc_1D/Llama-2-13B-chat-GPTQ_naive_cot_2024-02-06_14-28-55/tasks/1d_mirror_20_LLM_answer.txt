You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing their color.

For Example_1, we can see that the input sequence consists of six identical objects of color 6, followed by three zero-valued pixels (representing the background color). The output sequence has the same number of objects, but each object has been moved one position to the right and has had its color changed to 9. This means that the objects have been "moved" and "scaled" in some sense.

For Example_2, we can see that the input sequence consists of five objects of color 5, followed by four zero-valued pixels. The output sequence has the same number of objects, but each object has been resized to twice its original size and has had its color changed to 0. This means that the objects have been "scaled" and "recolored".

For Example_3, we can see that the input sequence consists of six objects of color 6, followed by three zero-valued pixels. The output sequence has the same number of objects, but each object has been moved two positions to the right and has had its color changed to 9. This means that the objects have been "moved" and "scaled" again.

Based on these patterns, it appears that the transformation involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing their color. However, the exact rules governing these operations are not explicitly stated, so we must rely on our understanding of the examples provided to make inferences about the desired transformation.

Now, let's turn to the test case provided:

input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To begin, let's analyze the input sequence:

* The first three pixels (0, 0, 7) represent the background color.
* The next four pixels (7, 7, 7, 7) represent five objects of color 7.
* The final three pixels (9, 0, 0) represent the background color again.

Now, let's apply the transformation rules we've inferred from the examples:

1. Move each object one position to the right:
	* The first object (color 7) moves to index 1.
	* The second object (color 7) moves to index 2.
	* The third object (color 7) moves to index 3.
	* The fourth object (color 7) moves to index 4.
2. Change the color of each object to 9:
	* The first object (now at index 1) changes from color 7 to color 9.
	* The second object (now at index 2) changes from color 7 to color 9.
	* The third object (now at index 3) changes from color 7 to color 9.
	* The fourth object (now at index 4) changes from color 7 to color 9.

Applying these transformations yields the following output sequence:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the desired transformation for the given input sequence is:

transformation: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
