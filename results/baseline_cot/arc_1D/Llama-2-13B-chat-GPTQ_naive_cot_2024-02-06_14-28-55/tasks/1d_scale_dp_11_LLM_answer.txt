[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:

* The input sequence is a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (one of 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 9).
* Each object in the input sequence is defined by a set of pixels with the same color. For example, if we have two adjacent pixels with the same color, they form an object.
* The output sequence is also a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents the same pixel color as the corresponding input pixel. However, the output sequence has undergone some transformation based on the objects in the input sequence.
* The transformation involves moving, scaling, and aligning objects in the input sequence to create the output sequence. Specifically, objects can be moved horizontally or vertically, scaled up or down, and aligned with other objects.
* There are also noise pixels in the input sequence that do not belong to any object. These pixels remain unchanged in the output sequence.

Now, let me explain how I would approach this task. First, I would start by carefully examining the input and output sequences and identifying the objects in the input sequence. Next, I would apply the transformation rules to each object in the input sequence, taking into account their positions, sizes, and colors. Finally, I would assemble the transformed objects into the output sequence.

Here's the JSON response for the given test case:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input and output sequences differ only in the color of one object, which has been replaced by a different color.",
"Example_2": "The input and output sequences differ only in the size of one object, which has been scaled up.",
"Example_3": "The input and output sequences differ only in the position of one object, which has been moved horizontally."
},
"overall_pattern": "Each object in the input sequence is transformed independently according to specific rules, resulting in a unique output sequence for each input sequence.",
"instructions": "Transform the input sequence into the output sequence using the specified transformation rules, paying close attention to object positions, sizes, and colors.",

"input": "[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]",
"object_description": "Identify the objects in the input sequence and describe them in terms of their positions, sizes, and colors.",
"transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects in the input sequence should be transformed to create the output sequence, including any changes to their positions, sizes, and colors.",
