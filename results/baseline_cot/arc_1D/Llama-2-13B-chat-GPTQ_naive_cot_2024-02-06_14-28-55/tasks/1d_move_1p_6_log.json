            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, where each object is defined by its size, position, and color. Here's my analysis of the three examples:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 10, containing two objects of color 2, each with size 2 and located at positions 1-2 and 4-5. The output sequence has the same length and contains the same two objects, but their positions have been swapped (i.e., object 1 is now at positions 4-5, and object 2 is now at positions 1-2). This transformation can be described as \"move object 1 to positions 4-5 and object 2 to positions 1-2\".\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 7, containing five objects of color 5, each with size 5 and located at positions 1-5. The output sequence has the same length and contains the same five objects, but their sizes have been reduced to 0 (i.e., all objects have been removed). This transformation can be described as \"remove all objects\".\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence of length 10, containing eight objects of color 8, each with size 8 and located at positions 1-8. The output sequence has the same length and contains the same eight objects, but their positions have been shifted by one unit to the right (i.e., object 1 is now at position 2, object 2 is now at position 3, and so on). This transformation can be described as \"shift all objects one unit to the right\".\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying some type of operation to the objects in the input sequence, possibly involving movement, resizing, or other types of manipulation. However, without more information about the specific requirements of the task, it's difficult to determine exactly what the desired transformation will be.\n\nAs for the test case input sequence you provided, here's my analysis:\n\nThe input sequence consists of 10 elements, all of which are 0 except for one element at position 5, which is 5. Based on the examples above, it seems likely that the desired transformation will involve modifying the object at position 5 in some way. However, without more information, it's impossible to predict exactly what the desired outcome will be.\n\nTherefore, I suggest starting by carefully analyzing the given examples and trying to identify any patterns or commonalities that might provide clues about the desired transformation. Once you have a better understanding of what needs to be done, you can begin working on the actual transformation. Good luck!"
