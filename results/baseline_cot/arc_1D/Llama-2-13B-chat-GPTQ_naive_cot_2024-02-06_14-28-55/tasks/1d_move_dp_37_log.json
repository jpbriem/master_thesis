            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color.\n\nFor Example_1, we can see that all objects of color 3 are removed, while objects of color 0 are set to 0. This suggests that the transformation involves filtering out certain objects based on their color.\n\nFor Example_2, we can see that all objects of color 6 are scaled up by a factor of 6, while objects of color 0 are set to 0. This suggests that the transformation involves scaling objects based on their color.\n\nFor Example_3, we can see that all objects of color 1 are moved to the left by one position, while objects of color 0 are set to 0. This suggests that the transformation involves moving objects based on their color.\n\nBased on these patterns, we can infer that the goal of the transformation is to modify the input sequence by applying operations to the objects in the sequence based on their properties.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the test case input sequence:\n\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\nTo begin, we can identify the objects in the input sequence as follows:\n\n* Object 1: [7, 7, 7, 7] (color: 7)\n* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0] (color: 0)\n* Object 3: [5, 0, 0, 0] (color: 5)\n\nNext, we need to determine what operations to apply to each object based on its properties. Let's examine the objects one by one:\n\nObject 1: [7, 7, 7, 7] (color: 7)\n\n* Operation: Move all objects of color 7 to the right by one position.\n\nNew position: [8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nObject 2: [0, 0, 0, 0] (color: 0)\n\n* Operation: Set all objects of color 0 to 0.\n\nNew position: [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObject 3: [5, 0, 0, 0] (color: 5)\n\n* Operation: Scale all objects of color 5 by a factor of 2.\n\nNew position: [10, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the test output sequence would be:\n\noutput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
