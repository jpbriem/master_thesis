            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring. Additionally, there may be conditions or constraints that affect the application of these operations.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are six objects in the input sequence, each with a value of 6. These objects are located at positions 1-6, respectively.\n* Relations between objects: There are no obvious relationships between the objects in terms of distance, alignment, or overlap.\n* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.\n* Arithmetic operations: None are applied to the objects in the input sequence.\n* Conditions: None are specified in the given input sequence.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is simply to rearrange the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, we can move the objects one position to the right, so that the first object becomes the second object, the second object becomes the third object, and so on. This results in the following output sequence:\n\n`[6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nTherefore, the transformation from input to output is simply a shift of one position to the right.\n\nTo create the test output sequence, we need to apply the same transformation to the given input sequence. Here's the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Test output sequence\noutput = np.array([6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
