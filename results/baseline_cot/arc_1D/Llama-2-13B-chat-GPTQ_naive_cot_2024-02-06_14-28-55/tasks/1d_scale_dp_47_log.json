            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including:\n\n* Moving objects (represented by changes in position)\n* Resizing objects (represented by changes in size)\n* Changing the color of objects (represented by changes in color value)\n* Removing objects (represented by gaps in the sequence)\n* Copying objects (represented by repeated values)\n\nAdditionally, there may be some noise pixels added to the output sequence.\n\nTo begin, let's analyze the first example:\n\nInput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]\nOutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all the objects (represented by the non-zero values) have been moved one position to the right, while the background color (represented by the zero values) has remained unchanged. Additionally, we can see that the object at index 4 has been resized to twice its original size.\n\nNow, let's consider the second example:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all the objects (represented by the non-zero values) have been moved one position to the left, while the background color (represented by the zero values) has remained unchanged. Additionally, we can see that the object at index 4 has been resized to half its original size.\n\nFinally, let's consider the third example:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that all the objects (represented by the non-zero values) have been duplicated, while the background color (represented by the zero values) has remained unchanged.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving, resizing, changing the color of, and removing objects, as well as adding noise pixels. To transform a new input sequence, we will need to carefully examine each object in the sequence and apply the appropriate transformations based on the patterns observed in the examples.\n\nHere is the JSON response for the test case:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"All objects moved one position to the right, object at index 4 resized to twice its original size\",\n\"Example_2\": \"All objects moved one position to the left, object at index 4 resized to half its original size\",\n\"Example_3\": \"All objects duplicated\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Movement, resizing, color change, removal, and addition of noise pixels\",\n\"instructions\": \"Carefully examine each object in the sequence and apply the appropriate transformations based on the patterns observed in the examples\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Non-zero values represent objects, zero values represent background color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Apply the appropriate transformations based on the patterns observed in the examples\",\n\"output\": \"[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]\"\n}"
