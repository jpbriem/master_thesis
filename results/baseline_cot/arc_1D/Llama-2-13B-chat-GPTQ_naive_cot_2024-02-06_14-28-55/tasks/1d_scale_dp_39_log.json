            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, resizing, and changing color. Additionally, there are noise pixels that appear to be randomly distributed throughout the sequence.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0]`, here's what I observe:\n\n* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color `2` (represented by the numbers `2`) and one object of color `8` (represented by the number `8`). These objects are located at positions `1-3`, `5-6`, and `8-9`, respectively.\n* Noise pixels: There are four noise pixels in the input sequence, located at positions `4`, `7`, `10`, and `11`.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Move the object at position `1` (color `2`) one position to the right, so that it becomes part of the object at position `2`. This results in an object of size `3` instead of `2`.\n2. Resize the object at position `5` (color `2`) to size `2`, since it already contains the moved object from position `1`.\n3. Change the color of the object at position `8` (color `8`) to color `2`, since it is already adjacent to two objects of color `2`.\n4. Add a new object of color `2` at position `10`, since there is a gap in the sequence after the object at position `9`.\n5. Remove the noise pixel at position `4`.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
