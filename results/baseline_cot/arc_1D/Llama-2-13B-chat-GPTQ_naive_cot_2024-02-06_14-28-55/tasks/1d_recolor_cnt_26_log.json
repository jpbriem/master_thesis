The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, I can see that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values from 0 to 6, representing different colors.\n* Each object in the input sequence is defined by a set of pixels with the same color. For example, the first object in the input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], which means there are six pixels with value 6, followed by three pixels with value 0.\n* The output sequence is obtained by applying a set of transformations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and changing the color of some objects.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here's the pattern I observe:\n\n* Objects in the input sequence are moved horizontally by a fixed amount (either 3 or 6 pixels).\n* Objects in the input sequence are scaled up or down by a factor of 2 or 3.\n* Some objects in the input sequence have their color changed to a different value (either 3 or 9).\n\nWith these observations in mind, let me describe the transformation from input to output for each example:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the first object (with value 6) is moved 3 pixels to the right, and the second object (with value 0) is moved 3 pixels to the left.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all objects are scaled up by a factor of 3, so the first object (with value 6) becomes [9, 9, 9].\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the first object (with value 6) is moved 6 pixels to the right, and the second object (with value 0) is moved 6 pixels to the left. Additionally, the third object (with value 6) is scaled up by a factor of 2.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output:\n\n1. Move objects horizontally by a fixed amount (either 3 or 6 pixels).\n2. Scale objects up or down by a factor of 2 or 3.\n3. Change the color of some objects (either to 3 or 9).\n\nTo perform these transformations, we need to iterate through each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation based on the observed patterns.\n\nFinally, here's the transformation function in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"....\",\n\"Overall_Pattern\": \"describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"Instructions\": \"describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"Transformation\": {\n\"Input\": \"copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"Object_Description\": \"regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Transformed_Objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"Output\": \"create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."
