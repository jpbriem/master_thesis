The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving objects and their properties. Here's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 9, representing different pixel colors.\n* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.\n* The output sequence will also consist of integers from 0 to 9, but with some modifications based on the objects in the input sequence.\n* There are several types of transformations that can occur between the input and output sequences, including moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color.\n* Some transformations may depend on the distance between objects, their alignment, overlapping, or containment.\n* Arithmetic operations may be performed on objects, such as counting and sorting.\n* Conditional rules may apply to the transformations.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all objects have been removed and replaced with zeros. This suggests that the transformation involves removing all objects and replacing them with a single object (the number 9).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all objects have been scaled down to size 3. This suggests that the transformation involves scaling all objects down by a factor of 3.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all objects have been moved to the left by 2 positions. This suggests that the transformation involves shifting all objects by 2 positions to the left.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output:\n\n1. Remove all objects and replace them with a single object (the number 9).\n2. Scale all objects down by a factor of 3.\n3. Move all objects to the left by 2 positions.\n\nBased on these patterns, here's the transformation function in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"removing all objects and replacing them with a single object\",\n\"Example_2\": \"scaling all objects down by a factor of 3\",\n\"Example_3\": \"moving all objects to the left by 2 positions\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"replacing objects with a single object or modifying their position and size\",\n\"instructions\": \"remove, scale, or move objects as indicated\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"pixels with the same color are grouped together as objects\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"a single object with value 9, or objects scaled down by a factor of 3, or objects moved to the left by 2 positions\",\n\"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
