The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color. Additionally, there are some noise pixels that need to be taken into account.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the input sequence you provided:\n\n`input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]`\n\nHere's how I would describe the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 8, start_index: 0, end_index: 8, size: 8} (a single object of color 8 spanning from index 0 to 8)\n* Object 2: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 10, size: 1} (a single object of color 0 spanning from index 9 to 10)\n* Noise pixels: {color: 0, start_index: 11, end_index: 14} (four noise pixels of color 0 located at indices 11 to 14)\n\nNow, let's consider the desired output sequence. Based on the examples provided, we can see that the output sequence should consist of the original objects, but possibly moved, resized, or modified in some way. Here's my interpretation of the output sequence for the given input:\n\n`output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4]`\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence is almost identical to the input sequence, but with a few key differences:\n\n* Object 1 has been moved to the beginning of the sequence (from index 0 to index 1).\n* Object 2 has been moved to the end of the sequence (from index 9 to index 14).\n* The noise pixels have been removed.\n\nWith these observations in mind, here's the transformation function that I would propose:\n```json\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Object_1\": {\"move\": [\"0\", \"1\"]},\n\"Object_2\": {\"move\": [\"9\", \"14\"]},\n\"noise_pixels\": {\"remove\": []}\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"move objects and remove noise pixels\",\n\"instructions\": \"Move Object_1 to the beginning of the sequence and Move Object_2 to the end of the sequence. Remove the noise pixels.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4]\",\n\"object_description\": [\"Object_1\", \"Object_2\"],\n\"transformed_objects\": [\"[0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4]\"],\n\"output\": \"[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\"\n}\n```\nIn summary, the transformation function moves Object_1 to the beginning of the sequence and moves Object_2 to the end of the sequence, while removing the noise pixels. This produces the desired output sequence `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`."
