[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, changing size, and sometimes disappearing or appearing. The noise pixels also seem to play a role in the transformation.

Based on these observations, here is my understanding of the transformation pattern:

* Objects can move horizontally (left or right) by a certain number of pixels.
* Objects can change size by either growing or shrinking by a certain number of pixels.
* Objects can disappear or appear in the output sequence.
* Noise pixels can cause objects to move or change size.

With this understanding, let me describe the transformation for each example:

Example 1:
In the input sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we have three objects of color 1, each with a size of 1 pixel. In the output sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the objects have moved horizontally by 1 pixel to the right, so they now occupy the positions [2, 2, 2]. Additionally, the object at position [3] has grown in size by 1 pixel.

Example 2:
In the input sequence [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], we have five objects of color 8, each with a size of 8 pixels. In the output sequence [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0], the objects have not moved but have grown in size by 1 pixel.

Example 3:
In the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], we have five objects of color 5, each with a size of 5 pixels. In the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7], the objects have not moved but have grown in size by 1 pixel.

Now, let me describe the transformation for the test case input sequence:

Input sequence: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Object description: We have four objects of color 4, each with a size of 4 pixels.

Transformed objects:

* Object at position [1]: moves horizontally by 1 pixel to the right, so it now occupies position [2].
* Object at position [2]: grows in size by 1 pixel.
* Object at position [3]: disappears.
* Object at position [4]: appears.

Output sequence: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Overall pattern: The input sequence is transformed by applying the above-described rules to each object in the sequence. The output sequence is obtained by applying the transformations to the input sequence.

Instructions: To transform a new input sequence, apply the above-described rules to each object in the sequence, taking care to ensure that objects move horizontally by the correct number of pixels, grow or shrink by the correct number of pixels, and disappear or appear as necessary.

Transformation:

* Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Object description: We have four objects of color 4, each with a size of 4 pixels.
* Transformed objects:
	+ Object at position [1]: moves horizontally by 1 pixel to the right, so it now occupies position [2].
	+ Object at position [2]: grows in size by 1 pixel.
	+ Object at position [3]: disappears.
	+ Object at position [4]: appears.
* Output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test output:

numpy array([4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0])

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
