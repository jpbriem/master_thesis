            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, resizing, and changing color. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5]\nOutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5]\n\nIn this example, all objects are duplicated and their size is increased by a factor of 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nOutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all objects are resized to three times their original size, but their position and color remain unchanged.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, all objects are resized to four times their original size, but their position and color remain unchanged.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves scaling objects up or down by a fixed amount, while keeping their position and color unchanged.\n\nNow, let me analyze the given test input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nI can see that there are several objects in the input sequence, each with a specific color (0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3). The objects are located at positions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and they have sizes [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1].\n\nTo transform this input sequence into the corresponding output sequence, I need to apply the transformation pattern described above. Here's what I would do:\n\n1. Move all objects three positions to the right, so that the objects are now located at positions [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\n2. Resize all objects to three times their original size, so that the objects now have sizes [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18].\n3. Change the color of the second object from 3 to 5.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5]\n\nAs you can see, the objects in the output sequence have been moved to the right, resized, and one object has had its color changed.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\nThe input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is based on scaling objects up or down by a fixed amount, while keeping their position and color unchanged.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Move all objects the same number of positions to the right.\n2. Resize all objects by a fixed amount (either up or down).\n3. Change the color of any objects as specified.\n\nTransformation:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]\nObject Description:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 1}\n* Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 2}\n* Object 4: {color: 5, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 3}\n\nTransformed Objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 5, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 6}\n* Object 3: {color: 5, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 9}\n* Object 4: {color: 5, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 12}\n\nOutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5]\n\nNote that the objects in the output sequence have been moved to the right, resized, and one object has had its color changed, just like in the previous examples."
