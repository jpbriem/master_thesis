The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 8, where adjacent pixels of the same value represent objects. The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of logical rules that involve object transformations, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and twos, with adjacent pixels of the same value representing objects. The output sequence has all zeros replaced with zeros, and all twos replaced with zeros. This suggests that the transformation involves moving objects (represented by twos) to the beginning of the sequence, while leaving non-object pixels unchanged.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and threes, with adjacent pixels of the same value representing objects. The output sequence has all zeros replaced with zeros, and all threes replaced with zeros. This suggests that the transformation involves moving objects (represented by threes) to the beginning of the sequence, while leaving non-object pixels unchanged.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of zeros and fours, with adjacent pixels of the same value representing objects. The output sequence has all zeros replaced with zeros, and all fours replaced with zeros. This suggests that the transformation involves moving objects (represented by fours) to the beginning of the sequence, while leaving non-object pixels unchanged.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation involves moving objects to the beginning of the sequence, while leaving non-object pixels unchanged. To perform the transformation, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence based on their values (zeros and twos, threes, or fours). We can then move these objects to the beginning of the sequence, replacing any zeros or non-object pixels they were touching with zeros. Finally, we can replace any remaining non-object pixels with zeros.\n\nTo summarize, the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is as follows:\n\n* Input: A sequence of integers from 0 to 8, where adjacent pixels of the same value represent objects.\n* Output: A transformed sequence of integers from 0 to 8, where objects are moved to the beginning of the sequence and non-object pixels are replaced with zeros.\n\nNow, let me provide the transformation for the given test input sequence:\n\nTest input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nTransformed output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]\n\nAs requested, here is the description of the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObjects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\n\nAnd here is the description of the transformed objects in the output sequence:\n\nTransformed objects in the output sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\n\nFinally, here is the complete JSON response:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"....\",\n\"Example_3\": \"....\",\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
