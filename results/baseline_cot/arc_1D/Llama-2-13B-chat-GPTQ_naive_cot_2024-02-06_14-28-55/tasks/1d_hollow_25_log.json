            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, resizing, and changing color. Additionally, there are noise pixels that can affect the objects. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we see three objects (colors 7, 7, and 7) that are moved horizontally to the left without changing their size or color. The background color changes from 0 to 0.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0]\n\nHere, we have two objects (colors 6 and 6) that are moved vertically downwards without changing their size or color. The background color remains unchanged at 0.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nIn this example, we see four objects (colors 7, 7, 7, and 7) that are moved diagonally upwards and to the right without changing their size or color. The background color changes from 0 to 7.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving objects horizontally or vertically, resizing them, and changing their color. Noise pixels may also appear in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let me analyze the given test input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI observe the following objects in this input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: starts at index 0, ends at index 1, has size 1, and is colored 1.\n* Object 2: starts at index 2, ends at index 3, has size 2, and is colored 1.\n* Object 3: starts at index 4, ends at index 5, has size 1, and is colored 1.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into the corresponding output sequence, I need to apply the transformation pattern described above. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to the left by one position, keeping its size and color unchanged.\n\nNew object positions:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 1]\n\nStep 2: Move object 2 downwards by one position, keeping its size and color unchanged.\n\nNew object positions:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 1]\n* Object 2: [1, 2]\n\nStep 3: Resize object 3 to size 2, keeping its color unchanged.\n\nNew object positions:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 1]\n* Object 2: [1, 2]\n* Object 3: [3, 4]\n\nStep 4: Change the background color to 1.\n\nFinal output sequence:\n\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the output sequence for the given input sequence is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to perform additional tasks."
