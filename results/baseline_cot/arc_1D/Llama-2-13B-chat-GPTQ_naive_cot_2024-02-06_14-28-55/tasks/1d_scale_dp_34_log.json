The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color. Additionally, there are conditions attached to these operations that determine when they should be applied.\n\nTo describe the transformation pattern, we can identify the following key elements:\n\n* Objects: There are several objects in the input sequence, each with a specific size, position, and color. These objects can undergo various transformations based on their properties.\n* Operations: The transformation pattern includes several operations that can be applied to the objects, such as moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color.\n* Conditions: Each operation has conditions that must be met before it can be applied to an object. For example, an object may only be moved if it is touching another object of the same color.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the given test case:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, we can identify the following objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (size: 8, position: 0) - color: 0 (background color)\n* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 0, position: 0) - color: 1 (foreground color)\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation pattern to these objects:\n\n1. Move Object 1: Since Object 1 is not touching any other object, no movement is required.\n2. Scale Object 2: Since Object 2 is the only object of its color, it should be scaled up to match the size of Object 1.\n3. Remove Object 2: Since Object 2 is now the same size as Object 1, it can be removed.\n4. Copy Object 1: Since Object 1 is the only object of its color, it should be copied to fill the remaining space.\n5. Change color of Object 1: Since Object 1 is now surrounded by Object 2, it should change color to match Object 2.\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has been transformed according to the patterns observed in the examples, with Object 1 being moved, Object 2 being scaled and removed, and Object 1 being copied and changed color to match the surrounding objects."
