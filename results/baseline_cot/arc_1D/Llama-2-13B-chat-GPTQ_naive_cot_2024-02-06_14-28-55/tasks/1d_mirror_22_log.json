The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying certain operations to the objects in the input sequence, based on their properties such as size, position, and color. The operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color.\n\nTo describe the transformation pattern, we can start by identifying the objects in the input sequence. In the given input sequence [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], there are seven objects of color 7, each with a size of 1. There is also one object of color 9, with a size of 2.\n\nNow, let's consider how the objects in the input sequence should change in the output sequence. Based on the patterns seen in the examples, we can make the following observations:\n\n* All objects of color 7 should be moved to the right by 1 position, so that they are shifted over to the right by 1 pixel.\n* The object of color 9 should be scaled down by a factor of 2, so that it becomes half its original size.\n* None of the objects should be removed or copied.\n\nWith these observations in mind, here is the description of the transformation pattern:\n\nOverall Pattern:\nThe input sequence is transformed by applying the following operations to the objects in the sequence, based on their properties:\n\n* Move all objects of color 7 to the right by 1 position.\n* Scale the object of color 9 down by a factor of 2.\n\nObject Description:\nThe input sequence consists of eight objects, each with a specific color and size. The objects are as follows:\n\n* Seven objects of color 7, each with a size of 1.\n* One object of color 9, with a size of 2.\n\nTransformed Objects:\nAfter applying the transformation pattern, the objects in the input sequence should appear as follows in the output sequence:\n\n* Seven objects of color 7, each with a size of 1 and shifted to the right by 1 position.\n* One object of color 9, with a size of 1 and scaled down by a factor of 2.\n\nTransformation:\nTo transform the input sequence, we need to apply the following actions:\n\n* Move all objects of color 7 to the right by 1 position.\n* Scale the object of color 9 down by a factor of 2.\n\nInput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output: np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\nI hope this helps!
