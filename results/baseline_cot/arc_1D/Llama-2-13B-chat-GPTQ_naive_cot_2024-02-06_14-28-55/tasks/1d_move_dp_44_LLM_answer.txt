You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, resizing, and changing color. Additionally, there are noise pixels that appear to be randomized. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:

Example 1:
Input: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]

In this example, we see three objects (colors 7, 7, and 7) that are moved horizontally to the right by one pixel each. The background color changes from 0 to 9.

Example 2:
Input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]

Here, we have two objects (colors 3 and 9) that are moved vertically downward by one pixel each. The background color remains unchanged at 0.

Example 3:
Input: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9]

In this example, we see three objects (colors 8, 8, and 8) that are resized to twice their original width and height. The background color remains unchanged at 0.

Now, let me analyze the test case input:

Input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, here's what I expect to happen:

* Objects will move horizontally or vertically by one pixel.
* Objects may change size, either growing or shrinking by one pixel.
* Background color may change randomly.

To transform the input sequence, I would need to perform the following steps:

Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence.

Object 1: [5, 5] - Color: 5, Start index: 1, End index: 2, Size: 2

Object 2: [5, 0] - Color: 5, Start index: 3, End index: 4, Size: 1

Object 3: [0, 9] - Color: 9, Start index: 5, End index: 6, Size: 1

Step 2: Apply transformations to objects.

For Object 1: Move horizontally right by one pixel.

New coordinates: [6, 5]

For Object 2: Move vertically down by one pixel.

New coordinates: [3, 5]

For Object 3: Resize to twice the original width and height.

New coordinates: [8, 9]

Step 3: Update the background color.

Randomly change the background color to any value between 0 and 9. Let's say the background color becomes 8.

Final output sequence: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]

Therefore, the expected output for the given test case input is [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9].
