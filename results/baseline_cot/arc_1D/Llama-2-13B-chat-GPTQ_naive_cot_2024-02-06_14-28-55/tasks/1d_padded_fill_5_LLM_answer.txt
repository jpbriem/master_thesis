[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:

* Each object in the input sequence has a specific color (0, 6, or 7) and a specific size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of that color).
* Objects of the same color are always touching each other, meaning they share at least one boundary pixel.
* If two objects of the same color are touching, their sizes must be equal.
* Objects cannot overlap, meaning if an object would otherwise overlap with another object, it will be moved to a non-overlapping location.
* Noise pixels (represented by the value 0) may appear anywhere in the input sequence.

Based on these rules, we can deduce the following transformation pattern:

* Any noise pixel in the input sequence will remain unchanged in the output sequence.
* Any object in the input sequence that is entirely contained within another object will be removed and replaced with a single noise pixel.
* Any object in the input sequence that overlaps with another object will be moved to a non-overlapping location, while maintaining its original size.
* Any object in the input sequence that is not entirely contained within another object will retain its original size and position.

Now, let's apply this transformation pattern to the given test input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

First, we'll identify the objects in the input sequence:

Objects:

* Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3}
* Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 2}
* Object_3: {color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 10, size: 3}

Next, we'll apply the transformation rules to each object:

Object_1: Since Object_1 is entirely contained within Object_3, it will be removed and replaced with a single noise pixel.

Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]

Object_2: Since Object_2 overlaps with Object_1, it will be moved to a non-overlapping location.

Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]

Object_3: Since Object_3 is not affected by any other objects, it will retain its original size and position.

Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]

Therefore, the output sequence for the given test input sequence is:

[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
