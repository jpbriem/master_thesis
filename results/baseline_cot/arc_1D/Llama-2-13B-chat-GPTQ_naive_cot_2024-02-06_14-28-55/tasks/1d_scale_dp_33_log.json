            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on objects in the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and recoloring. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0], which contains multiple objects of color 2. These objects are moved horizontally by one position to the right, so that their left edges align with the left edge of the input sequence. Additionally, all objects of color 2 are scaled up by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions. Finally, all noise pixels (represented by the value 0) are removed from the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7], which contains multiple objects of color 6. These objects are moved vertically by one position downwards, so that their top edges align with the top edge of the input sequence. Additionally, all objects of color 6 are scaled up by a factor of 2 in the vertical direction only. Finally, all noise pixels (represented by the value 0) are removed from the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], which contains a single object of color 6 that spans the entire input sequence. This object is not moved or scaled, but rather remains stationary. All noise pixels (represented by the value 0) are removed from the output sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying a series of operations to the objects in the input sequence, including movement, scaling, and removal of noise pixels. To perform the transformation on a new input sequence, we would need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate operations based on its properties.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:\n\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence, we can follow the patterns established in the previous examples. First, we can move all objects of color 3 to the right by one position, since they are currently aligned at the left edge of the input sequence. Next, we can scale all objects of color 3 up by a factor of 2 in the horizontal direction only, so that they span two positions in the output sequence. Finally, we can remove all noise pixels (represented by the value 0) from the output sequence.\n\nHere is the resulting test output sequence:\n\noutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."
