[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations, noise pixels, and arithmetical operations.

To begin, let me describe the input sequence you provided:

Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, let me identify the objects in the input sequence:

Objects:

* Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
* Object_2: {color: 2, start_index: 3, end_index: 5, size: 3}
* Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}
* Object_4: {color: 2, start_index: 9, end_index: 11, size: 2}

Based on the examples provided, here is my understanding of the transformation pattern:

1. Objects can move horizontally (left or right) by a fixed number of pixels.
2. Objects can change size by a factor of 2 or 3.
3. Pixels can become "noisy" (i.e., change color) randomly.
4. Arithmetic operations may be performed on object sizes and positions.

With these rules in mind, let me describe the transformation needed to convert the input sequence to the output sequence:

Output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's the step-by-step transformation process:

1. Object_1 moves left by 1 pixel, so its start index becomes 0.
2. Object_2 grows by a factor of 3, so its size increases to 3.
3. Object_3 disappears (removed).
4. Object_4 moves right by 2 pixels, so its end index becomes 11.
5. Random noise pixels appear at indices 2, 4, and 7, changing the color of those pixels to 2.
6. The size of Object_2 is multiplied by 2, so its size becomes 6.
7. The position of Object_3 is shifted left by 2 pixels, so its start index becomes 6.
8. The size of Object_4 is multiplied by 3, so its size becomes 9.

Therefore, the resulting output sequence is:

[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
