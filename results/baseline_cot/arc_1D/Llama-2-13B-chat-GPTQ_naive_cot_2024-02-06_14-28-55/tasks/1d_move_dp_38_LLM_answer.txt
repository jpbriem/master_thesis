You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects in the input sequence based on certain conditions. Here's my analysis of each example:

Example 1:
In this example, we have an input sequence of length 10 with four objects of color 0 (background) and one object of color 4. The output sequence has the same length and consists entirely of color 0, indicating that all objects were removed. This suggests that the transformation rule is to remove any object that has a size of 0.

Example 2:
Here, we have an input sequence of length 10 with five objects of color 4, and one object of color 9. The output sequence also has a length of 10 and consists of alternating colors 4 and 9. This suggests that the transformation rule is to alternate between two given colors, starting with the first color in the input sequence.

Example 3:
In this example, we have an input sequence of length 8 with three objects of color 3, and one object of color 9. The output sequence has a length of 8 and consists of alternating colors 3 and 9, similar to Example 2. However, the objects of color 3 are shifted by one position to the right compared to their original positions in the input sequence.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying a set of rules to combine objects in the input sequence. These rules may involve removing objects of a certain size, alternating between two given colors, or shifting objects by a certain amount. To transform the test input sequence, I would need to carefully examine each object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation rule based on the object's properties.

To summarize, the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs can be described as follows:

* Objects of the same color are combined based on certain conditions, such as removal, alternation, or shifting.
* The resulting output sequence will consist of the transformed objects, with the same length as the input sequence.

Now, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, step by step:

1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!
2. Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
3. Apply the appropriate transformation rule based on the object's properties, such as removing objects of a certain size, alternating between two given colors, or shifting objects by a certain amount.
4. Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!

Finally, here is the test output sequence in numpy array format:

array([0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
