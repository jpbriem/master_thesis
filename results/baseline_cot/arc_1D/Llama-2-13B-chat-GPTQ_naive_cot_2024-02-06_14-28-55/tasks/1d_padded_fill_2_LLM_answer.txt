[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the provided examples and the given description, here's my understanding of the task:

* We have a one-dimensional input sequence of pixels, represented as a list of integers from 0 to 9, where each integer corresponds to a specific pixel color (black, white, or one of seven different shades of gray).
* Each pixel in the input sequence can be either black (value 0) or white (value 9), and we want to transform the input sequence into an output sequence of the same length, but with different values.
* The transformation involves applying certain operations to the pixels in the input sequence, based on their colors and positions. These operations include moving pixels, changing their colors, resizing them, and removing or adding pixels.
* The goal is to find the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences, and then apply that relation to a given test input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying the following operations to the pixels in the input sequence:

* Moving pixels horizontally by a certain number of positions (e.g., moving pixel [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).
* Changing the color of pixels based on their positions and the colors of adjacent pixels (e.g., changing the color of pixel [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] if it is surrounded by pixels of color 5).
* Resizing pixels by multiplying their values by a fixed factor (e.g., multiplying the value of pixel [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] by 5 to get [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).
* Removing or adding pixels based on certain conditions (e.g., removing all pixels with value 0 if there are any pixels with value 5 nearby).

To perform the transformation, we need to carefully analyze the input sequence and determine which operations to apply to each pixel. We also need to keep track of the object descriptions, i.e., the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence, as well as the relationships between objects (such as distance, alignment, and overlap).
