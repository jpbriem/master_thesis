[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, resizing, and changing color. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:

Example 1:
Input: [0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Objects:

* Object 1 (color 2): starts at index 1, ends at index 2, size 2
* Object 2 (color 6): starts at index 4, ends at index 6, size 2

Transformation:

* Object 1 moves right by 1 pixel
* Object 2 moves left by 2 pixels

Example 2:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]

Objects:

* Object 1 (color 3): starts at index 1, ends at index 4, size 4

Transformation:

* Object 1 grows by 3 pixels in size

Example 3:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0]

Objects:

* Object 1 (color 5): starts at index 1, ends at index 3, size 3
* Object 2 (color 6): starts at index 4, ends at index 6, size 2

Transformation:

* Object 1 shrinks by 2 pixels in size
* Object 2 moves right by 2 pixels

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, resizing, and changing color. To perform the transformation, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformations to each object.

For the given test case input sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], here's what I would do:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence:
	* Object 1 (color 5): starts at index 1, ends at index 3, size 3
	* Object 2 (color 4): starts at index 4, ends at index 6, size 2
2. Apply the transformations to each object:
	* Object 1: shrink by 2 pixels in size
	* Object 2: move left by 2 pixels
3. Create the resulting test output sequence:
	* Output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
