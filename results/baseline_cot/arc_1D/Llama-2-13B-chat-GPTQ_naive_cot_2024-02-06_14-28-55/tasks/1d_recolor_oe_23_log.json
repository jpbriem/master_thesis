The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them up or down, and changing their color. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], which consists of alternating blue (0) and red (7) pixels. The output sequence [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] results from applying the following transformations:\n\n* Move the blue pixels (0) one position to the right, so they become red pixels (7).\n* Scale the remaining red pixels (7) down by a factor of 2, so they become green pixels (2).\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], which consists entirely of red pixels (7). The output sequence [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6] results from applying the following transformations:\n\n* Move all red pixels (7) two positions to the left, so they become green pixels (2).\n* Scale the remaining red pixels (7) down by a factor of 2, so they become blue pixels (2).\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], which consists entirely of red pixels (7). The output sequence [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2] results from applying the following transformations:\n\n* Move all red pixels (7) one position to the right, so they become green pixels (2).\n* Scale the remaining red pixels (7) down by a factor of 2, so they become blue pixels (2).\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving objects (pixels) horizontally, scaling them up or down, and changing their color. To perform the transformation, we need to carefully analyze the input sequence and apply the appropriate operations in the correct order.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Applying the same pattern as before, we can observe the following:\n\n* The input sequence consists of alternating red (7) and blue (0) pixels.\n* We can move the red pixels (7) one position to the right, so they become green pixels (2).\n* We can scale the remaining red pixels (7) down by a factor of 2, so they become blue pixels (2).\n\nTherefore, the expected output sequence for this test case is [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTo summarize, the transformation pattern involves moving objects, scaling them up or down, and changing their color. By carefully analyzing the input sequence and applying the appropriate operations in the correct order, we can produce the desired output sequence."
