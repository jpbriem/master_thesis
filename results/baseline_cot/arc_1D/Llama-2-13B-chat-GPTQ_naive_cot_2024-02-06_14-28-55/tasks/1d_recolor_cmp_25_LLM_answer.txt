[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the input-output pairs:

* Example_1: In this example, all instances of the color 7 are replaced with the color 9. This suggests that the transformation involves replacing certain colors with others.
* Example_2: In this example, all instances of the color 0 are removed. This suggests that the transformation may involve removing certain elements from the input sequence.
* Example_3: In this example, all instances of the color 0 are set to the color 7. This suggests that the transformation may involve setting certain elements to a specific value.

Based on these observations, I would suggest that the transformation involves applying certain operations to the input sequence, such as replacement, removal, or setting certain elements to specific values.

Now, let me describe the transformation in more detail:

* Objects: The input sequence consists of objects of various sizes and positions, represented by the different colors. The transformation involves applying operations to these objects, such as moving them, resizing them, or changing their color.
* Noise pixels: There are noise pixels present in the input sequence, which are represented by the color 0. These pixels may need to be removed or replaced depending on the specific transformation.
* Arithmetics based on objects: The transformation may involve counting, sorting, or other arithmetical operations based on the objects in the input sequence.
* Conditions: The transformation may be conditional, meaning that certain operations will only be applied if certain conditions are met. For example, an object may only be moved if it is touching another object of the same color.

To perform the transformation, I would recommend starting by identifying the objects in the input sequence and determining their properties, such as their size, position, and color. Once we have this information, we can apply the appropriate operations to each object based on the specific transformation required.

Finally, here is the transformation of the test input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you.
