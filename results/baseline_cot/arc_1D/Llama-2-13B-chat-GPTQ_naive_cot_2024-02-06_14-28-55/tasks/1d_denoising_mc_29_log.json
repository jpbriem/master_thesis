The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 1, 9, 3, 9, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a simple transformation rule. Here's my understanding of the task:\n\n* The input sequence is a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (one of 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 1, 9).\n* The output sequence is also a 1D array of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color.\n* The transformation rule is as follows:\n\t+ If the input pixel is 0, the output pixel remains unchanged (i.e., it keeps its original value).\n\t+ If the input pixel is not 0, it is replaced by the object color (i.e., 9) if the input pixel is completely surrounded by pixels of the same color (i.e., if it is an \"object\").\n\t+ Otherwise (i.e., if the input pixel is not completely surrounded by pixels of the same color), the output pixel retains its original value.\n\nWith this understanding, let me proceed to transform the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 1, 9, 3, 9, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, let me identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] (start index: 1, end index: 9, size: 9)\nObject 2: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] (start index: 10, end index: 18, size: 9)\nObject 3: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] (start index: 19, end index: 27, size: 9)\n\nNow, let me apply the transformation rule:\n\nOutput: [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 1, 9, 3, 9, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and each pixel has been transformed according to the given rule.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do for you."
