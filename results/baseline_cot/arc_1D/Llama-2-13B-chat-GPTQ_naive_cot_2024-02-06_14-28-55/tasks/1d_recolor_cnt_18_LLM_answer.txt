[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, I can see that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving object transformations. Here's my understanding of the pattern:

* Objects in the input sequence are assigned a unique ID (0-8) based on their color.
* Each object has a set of properties, including size (1-3), position (0-based indexing), and color (0-8).
* The output sequence is generated by applying a series of transformations to the input objects, including:
	+ Move: Objects can move left, right, up, or down by a fixed amount (1-3 pixels).
	+ Hollow: Objects can become hollow (size = 0) if they touch another object of the same color.
	+ Scale: Objects can increase or decrease in size by a factor of 2 or 3.
	+ Remove: Objects can be removed if they are completely surrounded by objects of the same color.
	+ Copy: Objects can be copied to create new objects of the same color.
	+ Recolor: Objects can change color to any other valid color (0-8).

Based on these transformations, we can generate the output sequence from the given input sequence. Here's the description of each object in the input sequence and how it changes in the output sequence:

Object 1 (ID = 0):

* Input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Object 2 (ID = 1):

* Input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Object 3 (ID = 2):

* Input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Overall Pattern:

* Objects move, hollow, scale, and remove each other according to the specified rules.
* Some objects change color.
* The output sequence is generated by applying these transformations to the input objects.

Now, let me explain how I would transform the given input sequence into the corresponding output sequence:

Input Sequence: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

1. Apply move operations:
	* Object 1 moves 1 pixel right.
	* Object 2 moves 1 pixel left.
	* Object 3 moves 1 pixel up.
2. Apply hollow operations:
	* Object 1 becomes hollow because it touches Object 2.
	* Object 2 becomes hollow because it touches Object 1.
3. Apply scale operations:
	* Object 1 scales by a factor of 2.
	* Object 2 scales by a factor of 3.
	* Object 3 scales by a factor of 2.
4. Apply remove operations:
	* Object 1 removes because it is completely surrounded by objects of the same color.
5. Apply copy operations:
	* Object 2 copies to create a new object at position [1, 1].
6. Apply recolor operations:
	* Object 3 changes color to 7.

Output Sequence: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the transformation from input to output is as follows:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
