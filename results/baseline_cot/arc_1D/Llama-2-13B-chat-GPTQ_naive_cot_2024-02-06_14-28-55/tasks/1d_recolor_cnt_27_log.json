            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of alternating blocks of two adjacent pixels with the same color (representing objects). The output sequence has similar blocks, but each block has been moved one pixel to the right and scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Additionally, any pixels that were originally black (value 0) have been replaced with white (value 9).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, we can see that the input sequence has been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees, so that each object has been turned into a horizontal line. The output sequence has the same rotation, but each object has also been scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Finally, any pixels that were originally black (value 0) have been replaced with white (value 9).\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]\nOutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the input sequence has been mirrored along the vertical axis, so that each object has been flipped over. The output sequence has the same mirroring, but each object has also been scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Finally, any pixels that were originally black (value 0) have been replaced with white (value 9).\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns seen in the examples, here's what I expect to happen to the input sequence:\n\n* The input sequence will be rotated clockwise by 90 degrees, so that each object becomes a horizontal line.\n* Each object will be scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n* Any pixels that were originally black (value 0) will be replaced with white (value 9).\n\nSo, the expected output sequence would be:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
