The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a series of pixels with values from 0 to 7, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence according to some specific pattern.\n\nHere's my analysis of the patterns observed in the examples:\n\n* Objects: In each example, there are one or more objects (i.e., sequences of adjacent pixels with the same value) that need to be transformed. The objects can move, change size, or change color.\n* Noise pixels: There may be noise pixels in the input sequence that do not belong to any object. These pixels should be removed.\n* Arithmetic operations: The transformation involves arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, and summing up the object sizes.\n* Conditional logic: The transformation is conditioned upon certain rules, such as whether two objects overlap or not.\n\nBased on these observations, here's the transformation pattern that I inferred:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence by finding contiguous sequences of pixels with the same value.\n2. Move objects to their correct positions based on the rules specified above. This may involve moving objects horizontally, vertically, or both.\n3. Resize objects according to the rules specified above. This may involve scaling objects up or down.\n4. Remove noise pixels that do not belong to any object.\n5. Perform arithmetic operations such as counting, sorting, and summing up the object sizes to determine the final output sequence.\n\nNow, let me apply this transformation pattern to the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence.\n\nObject 1: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] (size: 5)\nObject 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 1)\n\nStep 2: Move objects to their correct positions.\n\nObject 1: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] (size: 5) -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 1)\nObject 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 1) -> [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] (size: 5)\n\nStep 3: Resize objects according to the rules specified above.\n\nObject 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 1) -> [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] (size: 5)\nObject 2: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] (size: 5) -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size: 1)\n\nStep 4: Remove noise pixels that do not belong to any object.\n\nResulting output sequence: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd finally, here's the resulting output sequence in numpy array format:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\noutput = np.array([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
