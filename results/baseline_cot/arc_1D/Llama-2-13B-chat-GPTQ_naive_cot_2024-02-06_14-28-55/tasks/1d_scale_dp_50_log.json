The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves several operations on the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. Here's my analysis of each example:\n\nExample 1:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7], which consists of a series of objects of different sizes and colors. The output sequence [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7] is obtained by applying the following transformations:\n\n* Moving object at index 1 (color 6) one position to the right.\n* Scaling object at index 3 (color 6) by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n* Recoloring object at index 5 (color 6) to color 7.\n\nExample 2:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], which consists of a series of objects of the same size and color. The output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7] is obtained by applying the following transformations:\n\n* Moving all objects to the right by one position.\n* Scaling all objects by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n* Recoloring all objects to color 7.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, we have an input sequence [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], which consists of a series of objects of different sizes and colors. The output sequence [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0] is obtained by applying the following transformations:\n\n* Moving object at index 1 (color 6) one position to the right.\n* Scaling object at index 3 (color 6) by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n* Recoloring object at index 5 (color 6) to color 7.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving, scaling, and recoloring objects in the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence.\n\nNow, let me analyze the test case input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]. To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the following transformations:\n\n* Move the object at index 1 (color 5) one position to the right.\n* Scale the object at index 3 (color 5) by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n* Recolor the object at index 5 (color 5) to color 7.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7].\n\nTo summarize, the transformation pattern involves moving, scaling, and recoloring objects in the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence. The specific transformations applied to each input sequence depend on the objects present in the sequence and their properties, such as size and color."
