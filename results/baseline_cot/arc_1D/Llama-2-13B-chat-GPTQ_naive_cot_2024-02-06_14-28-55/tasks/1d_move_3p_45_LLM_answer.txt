You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color. Additionally, there are noise pixels that need to be taken into account.

For the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's my analysis:

* Objects: There are five objects in the input sequence, each consisting of a group of consecutive pixels with the same color (5, 5, 5, 5, and 0).
* Transformations: To apply the transformation pattern, we need to consider the following operations:
	+ Move: None (no objects need to be moved).
	+ Hollow: None (no objects need to be hollowed out).
	+ Scale: None (no objects need to be scaled up or down).
	+ Remove: None (no objects need to be removed).
	+ Copy: Apply to object 5, as it needs to be copied to the beginning of the sequence.
	+ Recolor: Apply to object 5, as it needs to change color from 5 to 0.
* Noise pixels: There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.
* Arithmetic operations: We don't need to perform any arithmetic operations based on the objects.
* Conditions: None (there are no conditions specified in the task).

Now, let me describe the difference between the input and output sequences for Example_1:

In Example_1, the input sequence is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. After applying the transformation pattern, we get the output sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`. As you can see, the only change is that object 1 has been copied to the beginning of the sequence and has had its color changed from 0 to 1.

Moving on to the test case input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, here's what I would do to transform it into the corresponding output sequence using the transformation pattern:

1. First, I would copy object 5 (which consists of the pixels with value 5) to the beginning of the sequence, since it needs to be moved to the left.
2. Next, I would change the color of object 5 from 5 to 0, since it needs to turn green.
3. Finally, I would remove the noise pixels (i.e., the zeros) from the sequence, leaving us with the final output sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Here's the complete transformation in JSON format, as requested:
```json
{
"description": {
"Example_1": "regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
"Example_2": "...",
"overall_pattern": "describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
"instructions": "describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step",
"transformation": {
"input": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
"object_description": "regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color",
"transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color",
"output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
},
"test_output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
