            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves objects moving, changing size, and sometimes disappearing or appearing. The noise pixels also seem to play a role in the transformation.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]`, here's what I observe:\n\n* Objects: There are six objects in the input sequence, each with a size of 6. They are all the same color (let's call it color `A`).\n* Noise pixels: There are four noise pixels in the input sequence, all with value 0.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Move object 1 one position to the right (from index 0 to index 1).\n2. Resize object 2 to size 8 (from size 6).\n3. Remove object 3 (index 2).\n4. Copy object 4 (index 3) to the position after object 2 (index 4).\n5. Resize object 5 to size 2 (from size 6).\n6. Add a new object at index 5 with size 2 and color `B` (different from color `A`).\n7. Set the noise pixels to the background color `0`.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n```json\n[0, 0, 6, 8, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n```\nIn summary, the main differences between the input and output sequences are:\n\n* Object 1 was moved one position to the right.\n* Object 2 was resized to size 8.\n* Object 3 was removed.\n* Object 4 was copied to the position after object 2.\n* Object 5 was resized to size 2.\n* A new object with size 2 and color `B` was added at index 5.\n* The noise pixels were set to the background color `0`."
