The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input-output relationship can be described as follows:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence has a specific color (0, 1, 2, or 3) and a specific size (represented by the number of consecutive pixels of that color).\n* The output sequence contains only objects of color 0 (background color), with each object having the same size as the corresponding object in the input sequence.\n* If an object in the input sequence overlaps with another object of the same color, the overlapping pixels are removed from both objects in the output sequence.\n* If an object in the input sequence does not overlap with any other object of the same color, it is simply copied to the output sequence without changes.\n\nWith these rules in mind, let's analyze the given test case:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, we can identify the following objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2] (size: 3)\n* Object 2: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2] (size: 3)\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation rules to the input sequence:\n\n1. Object 1 overlaps with Object 2, so we need to remove the overlapping pixels. Specifically, we need to remove the pixels at indices 1 and 3 from both objects.\n2. After removing the overlapping pixels, Object 1 has a remaining size of 1, and Object 2 has a remaining size of 2.\n3. Since Object 1 does not overlap with any other object of the same color, it is simply copied to the output sequence without changes.\n4. Similarly, since Object 2 overlaps with Object 1, but does not overlap with any other object of the same color, it is also copied to the output sequence without changes.\n\nTherefore, the expected output sequence for this test case is:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
