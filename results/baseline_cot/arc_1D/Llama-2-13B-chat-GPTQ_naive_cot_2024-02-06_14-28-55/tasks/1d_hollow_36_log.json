            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!\n\nFrom looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects (represented by changes in color) and resizing them. Additionally, there are no noise pixels, and arithmetics are based on objects.\n\nNow, let me analyze the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI can see that there are three objects in this sequence: two objects of color 2 and one object of color 0. The objects are located at positions 1-3 and 5-6, respectively.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I need to apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Move the objects of color 2 to the right by 1 position each. This will create a gap of 1 position between each object.\n\nStep 2: Resize the objects of color 2 to size 2.\n\nStep 3: Remove the object of color 0 since it is not affected by any of the above operations.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n\nOutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the objects of color 2 have been moved to the right by 1 position each, and their size has been increased to 2. The object of color 0 has been removed since it was not affected by any of the operations.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\nBased on the examples provided, the input-output relationship appears to be consistent across all input-output pairs. The pattern involves moving objects and resizing them, while removing any unchanged pixels (represented by color 0).\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color.\n2. Move each object to the right by 1 position.\n3. Resize each object to twice its original size.\n4. Remove any unchanged pixels (color 0).\n\nTransformation:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nObject Description:\n\n* Object 1: Color 2, start index 1, end index 2, size 2.\n* Object 2: Color 2, start index 3, end index 4, size 2.\n* Object 3: Color 0, start index 5, end index 6, size 0.\n\nTransformed Objects:\n\n* Object 1: Color 2, start index 1, end index 2, size 2.\n* Object 2: Color 2, start index 3, end index 4, size 2.\n* Object 3: None (removed).\n\nOutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output: np.array([2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])"
