prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. Here's my analysis of the input-output pairs:

Example 1:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of objects (represented by the numbers 0, 1, and 3) with varying sizes and positions. The output sequence has undergone several transformations:

* Objects 1 and 3 have been moved to the right by one position.
* Object 0 has been removed.
* Objects 1 and 3 have been resized to twice their original size.

Example 2:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]

In this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of objects (represented by the numbers 0, 2, and 8) with varying sizes and positions. The output sequence has undergone several transformations:

* Objects 2 and 8 have been moved to the left by one position.
* Object 0 has been added to the beginning of the sequence.
* Objects 2 and 8 have been resized to half their original size.

Example 3:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of objects (represented by the numbers 0, 2, and 8) with varying sizes and positions. The output sequence has undergone several transformations:

* Objects 2 and 8 have been moved to the right by one position.
* Object 0 has been added to the end of the sequence.
* Objects 2 and 8 have been resized to half their original size.

Based on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. To perform the transformation, we need to carefully analyze each object in the input sequence and determine the appropriate operation to apply.

Now, let me turn my attention to the test case you provided:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

To begin, let's analyze the input sequence:

* Object 1 is located at index 1 and has a size of 3.
* Object 3 is located at index 3 and has a size of 3.
* There are no other objects in the sequence.

Based on the patterns we've seen so far, it appears that the output sequence will consist of a series of objects with varying sizes and positions. To create the output sequence, we need to apply the appropriate operations to the input sequence. Here's what we can do:

1. Move object 1 to the right by one position.
2. Resize object 1 to twice its original size.
3. Add object 3 to the right of object 1.
4. Resize object 3 to twice its original size.
5. Remove object 0 from the sequence.

Here's the resulting output sequence:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
