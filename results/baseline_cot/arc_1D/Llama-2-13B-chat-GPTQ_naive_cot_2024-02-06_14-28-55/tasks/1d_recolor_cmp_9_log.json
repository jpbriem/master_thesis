The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, resizing, and changing color. Additionally, there are some noise pixels that need to be taken into account.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the input sequence you provided:\n\n`[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0]`\n\nHere's how I would describe the objects in this sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4} (a group of four consecutive pixels with color 8)\n* Object 2: {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 3} (a group of three consecutive pixels with color 8)\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 2} (a group of two consecutive pixels with color 0)\n* Noise pixels: {color: 0, start_index: 10, end_index: 11} (two noise pixels with color 0)\n\nNow, let's consider the transformation pattern. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation involves applying the following operations to the objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Move: Objects can be moved to different positions in the sequence.\n* Hollow: Objects can be resized to have a hole in the middle.\n* Scale: Objects can be resized to a different size.\n* Remove: Objects can be removed entirely from the sequence.\n* Copy: Objects can be copied to create duplicate objects.\n* Recolor: Objects can be given a different color.\n\nIn addition to these operations, there may also be conditions that affect the transformation. For example, if an object overlaps with another object, it may be necessary to adjust their sizes or positions to avoid overlapping.\n\nWith this information, we can now consider the test input sequence you provided:\n\n`[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0]`\n\nBased on the transformation pattern, here's how I would describe the transformation needed to produce the test output sequence:\n\n1. Move Object 1 to the beginning of the sequence (starting index 0).\n2. Resize Object 1 to have a size of 6 (ending index 5).\n3. Move Object 2 to the position after Object 1 (starting index 6).\n4. Resize Object 2 to have a size of 3 (ending index 8).\n5. Remove Object 3 (starting index 9).\n6. Copy Object 1 to create a new object at the end of the sequence (starting index 10).\n7. Resize the new object to have a size of 2 (ending index 11).\n8. Change the color of the new object to 4.\n\nHere's the resulting test output sequence:\n\n`[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 0]`\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain anything else."
