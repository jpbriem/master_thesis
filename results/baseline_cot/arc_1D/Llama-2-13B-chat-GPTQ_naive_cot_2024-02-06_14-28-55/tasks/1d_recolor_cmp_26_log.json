The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing different pixel colors, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using some sort of logical rules.\n\nHere's my analysis of the input and output sequences:\n\nInput Sequence:\n\n* The input sequence consists of 18 integers representing different pixel colors.\n* There are several runs of consecutive pixels with the same color (e.g., [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]).\n* There are also some isolated pixels with specific colors (e.g., [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]).\n\nOutput Sequence:\n\n* The output sequence consists of 18 integers representing different pixel colors.\n* The output sequence appears to be generated by applying some sort of logical rules to the input sequence, possibly involving object relationships, noise pixels, arithmetics, and conditions.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here's my interpretation of the input-output relationship:\n\n* Objects: The input sequence contains several objects of different sizes and colors, which are transformed into corresponding objects in the output sequence. These objects seem to be related to each other through various logical rules, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels in the input sequence appear to be noise pixels, which are not present in the output sequence.\n* Arithmetics: The output sequence appears to be generated by applying arithmetic operations to the input sequence, such as counting and sorting.\n* Conditions: The output sequence is conditioned on the input sequence, meaning that the transformation is dependent on the contents of the input sequence.\n\nNow, let me describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color and size.\n2. Apply logical rules to the identified objects, such as moving them, resizing them, or removing them if they overlap or contain other objects.\n3. Remove noise pixels from the input sequence.\n4. Apply arithmetic operations to the remaining pixels in the input sequence, such as counting and sorting.\n5. Condition the output sequence on the input sequence, taking into account any conditions or constraints specified in the task.\n\nFinally, here's the transformation function in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
