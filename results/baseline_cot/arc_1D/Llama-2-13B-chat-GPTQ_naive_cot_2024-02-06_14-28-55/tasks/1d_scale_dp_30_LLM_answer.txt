You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task!

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves combining objects of the same color into larger objects, while also applying some sort of scaling or resizing effect. Additionally, there appears to be a rule about objects being separated by a certain distance, and if they are too close together, they will merge into a single object.

Based on these observations, here is my inference for the relation between the input and output sequences:

The input sequence consists of a series of pixels, each with a value representing a color (0 for background, 1-9 for different colors). Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects, and the goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence where objects are combined and resized according to certain rules.

The transformation pattern involves the following operations:

* Combining adjacent pixels of the same color into a single object, with the size of the object determined by the number of pixels it contains.
* Scaling or resizing objects based on their size and the distance between them.
* Merging objects that are too close together into a single object.

With this understanding of the transformation pattern, let's now consider the given test case:

input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]

To apply the transformation pattern, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence. Based on the examples provided, we can see that objects are designated by consecutive pixels of the same color. In this case, we have the following objects:

Object 1: [8, 8, 8, 8]
Object 2: [8, 8, 8, 0]
Object 3: [8, 0, 0, 4]

Now, let's apply the transformation rules:

1. Combine adjacent pixels of the same color into a single object:
	* Object 1: [8, 8, 8, 8] becomes [8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
	* Object 2: [8, 8, 8, 0] becomes [8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
	* Object 3: [8, 0, 0, 4] becomes [8, 0, 0, 4, 0]
2. Scale or resize objects based on their size and the distance between them:
	* Object 1: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8] remains unchanged
	* Object 2: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0] grows to [8, 8, 8, 2, 2] due to the merging of Objects 2 and 3
	* Object 3: [8, 0, 0, 4, 0] shrinks to [8, 0, 0, 2, 0] due to the merging of Objects 2 and 3
3. Merge objects that are too close together into a single object:
	* Object 1: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8] remains unchanged
	* Object 2: [8, 8, 8, 2, 2] remains unchanged
	* Object 3: [8, 0, 0, 2, 0] remains unchanged

And finally, here is the resulting test output sequence:

output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 4, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
