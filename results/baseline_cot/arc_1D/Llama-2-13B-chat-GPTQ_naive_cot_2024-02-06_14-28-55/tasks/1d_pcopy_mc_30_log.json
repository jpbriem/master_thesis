The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.\n\nHere's my understanding of the transformation pattern:\n\n* Objects:\n\t+ Movement: Pixels can move horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., 1 pixel).\n\t+ Resizing: Pixels can change size by a factor (e.g., 2x larger or smaller).\n\t+ Color changes: Pixels can change color, either to a new color or back to the background color (0).\n\t+ Overlapping: Pixels can overlap each other, causing one pixel to cover another.\n* Noise pixels: Some pixels may be replaced with noise pixels (randomly chosen integer value between 0 and 8).\n* Arithmetic operations: Pixel values can be modified using basic arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) based on the object properties.\n\nNow, let me explain the differences between the input and output sequences for each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 5. The output sequence has the same set of pixels, but with some modifications:\n\n* Pixels at positions 1, 3, and 5 have moved one position to the right.\n* Pixels at positions 2 and 4 have moved two positions to the left.\n* Pixels at positions 6 and 8 have changed color from 0 to 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 8. The output sequence has the same set of pixels, but with some modifications:\n\n* Pixels at positions 1, 3, and 5 have changed color from 0 to 9.\n* Pixels at positions 2 and 4 have changed color from 8 to 1.\n* Pixels at positions 6 and 8 have moved one position to the right.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of a series of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 6. The output sequence has the same set of pixels, but with some modifications:\n\n* Pixels at positions 1, 3, and 5 have moved one position to the right.\n* Pixels at positions 2 and 4 have moved two positions to the left.\n* Pixels at positions 6 and 8 have changed color from 0 to 2.\n\nNow, let me describe the transformation for the given test input sequence:\n\nTest Input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the examples, here's my prediction for the output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nPlease note that this is just my best guess based on the patterns observed in the examples. The actual output sequence may differ depending on the specific implementation of the transformation pattern."
