You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input sequence is a sequence of integers representing pixel colors, and the output sequence is also a sequence of integers representing the same pixel colors, but with some transformations applied.

Here's my analysis of the patterns in the input and output sequences:

* Objects: The input sequence contains objects of different sizes and colors, represented by consecutive integers of the same color. For example, the object {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 4} represents a group of four pixels with color 7.
* Transformations: The output sequence applies various transformations to these objects, such as moving them, resizing them, changing their color, or removing them altogether.
* Noise pixels: Some pixels in the output sequence have a value of 0, indicating that they are noise pixels and do not belong to any object.
* Arithmetic operations: The output sequence performs arithmetic operations on the objects, such as counting the number of pixels in each object or sorting the objects by size.
* Conditional logic: The output sequence includes conditional statements that determine which transformations to apply based on the properties of the objects.

Based on these observations, I would suggest that the key to transforming the input sequence into the output sequence is to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformations to them based on their properties.

To accomplish this, I would recommend the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for consecutive integers of the same color.
2. Apply the following transformations to each object based on its properties:
	* Move objects based on their position and size.
	* Resize objects based on their size and the distance between them.
	* Change the color of objects based on their position and the distance between them.
	* Remove objects if they are too small or if they overlap with other objects.
3. Add noise pixels to the output sequence to simulate random fluctuations in the image.
4. Perform arithmetic operations on the objects, such as counting the number of pixels in each object or sorting the objects by size.
5. Use conditional statements to determine which transformations to apply based on the properties of the objects.

With these steps, we can create a function that takes the input sequence and produces the corresponding output sequence. Here's an example implementation in Python:
```python
def transform_sequence(input_seq):
    # Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence
    objects = []
    current_obj = None
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        if input_seq[i] == 0:
            continue
        if current_obj is None:
            current_obj = {color: input_seq[i], start_index: i, end_index: i + 1}
        else:
            current_obj.end_index = i + 1
            objects.append(current_obj)
            current_obj = {color: input_seq[i], start_index: i, end_index: i + 1}

    # Step 2: Apply transformations to objects
    for obj in objects:
        # Move objects based on their position and size
        if obj.start_index < obj.end_index:
            obj.move_to(obj.start_index, obj.end_index - obj.start_index)
        # Resize objects based on their size and the distance between them
        elif obj.end_index - obj.start_index > 2:
            obj.resize_to(obj.end_index - obj.start_index)
        # Change the color of objects based on their position and the distance between them
        elif obj.start_index % 2 == 0:
            obj.color = 9
        # Remove objects if they are too small or if they overlap with other objects
        elif obj.end_index - obj.start_index <= 2 or obj.overlaps_with(objects):
            objects.remove(obj)

    # Step 3: Add noise pixels to the output sequence
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        if random.random() < 0.5:
            input_seq[i] = 0

    # Step 4: Perform arithmetic operations on the objects
    for obj in objects:
        obj.count += 1
    for obj in objects:
        obj.sort_by_size()

    # Step 5: Use conditional statements to determine which transformations to apply based on the properties of the objects
    for obj in objects:
        if obj.count >= 3:
            obj.resize_to(obj.end_index - obj.start_index)
        elif obj.overlaps_with(objects):
            obj.move_to(obj.start_index, obj.end_index - obj.start_index)

    return objects
```
This function takes the input sequence as a list of integers and returns the transformed output sequence. It identifies objects in the input sequence, applies transformations to them based on their properties, adds noise pixels to the output sequence, performs arithmetic operations on the objects, and uses conditional statements to determine which transformations to apply based on the properties of the objects.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
