            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and changing color.\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]`, here's my analysis:\n\n* Objects: There are three objects in the input sequence: two objects of color 6 (represented by the two consecutive runs of 6s) and one object of color 3 (represented by the single 3 at the end of the sequence).\n* Transformations: To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following transformations to the objects:\n\t+ Move the two objects of color 6 so that they are adjacent to each other (i.e., move the second 6 to the left to be next to the first 6).\n\t+ Scale both objects of color 6 by a factor of 2 (i.e., double their size).\n\t+ Change the color of the third object (the one of color 3) to color 6.\n* Output sequence: Applying these transformations to the input sequence yields the following output sequence: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]`.\n\nTherefore, the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output would be:\n\n1. Move the two objects of color 6 so that they are adjacent to each other.\n2. Scale both objects of color 6 by a factor of 2.\n3. Change the color of the third object (the one of color 3) to color 6.\n\nAnd the overall pattern of the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is:\n\n* All input sequences will have objects of the same color consecutively appearing in the sequence.\n* Each object will be moved, scaled, or changed in some way to produce the corresponding output sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
