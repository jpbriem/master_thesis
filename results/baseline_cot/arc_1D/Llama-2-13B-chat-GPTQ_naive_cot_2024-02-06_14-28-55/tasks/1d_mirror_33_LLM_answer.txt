[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this task! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the input and output sequences are related by a specific pattern involving objects and their properties. Here's my understanding of the task so far:

* The input sequence consists of integers from 0 to 9, representing different pixel colors.
* Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.
* The output sequence will also consist of integers from 0 to 9, but with some modifications based on the objects in the input sequence.
* There are several types of transformations that can occur between the input and output sequences, including moving, scaling, removing, copying, and changing color.
* The exact nature of these transformations is not specified, but they seem to be based on logical rules that involve the objects in the input sequence.

With this understanding, let me proceed to the task at hand. You have provided an input sequence, and I will produce the corresponding output sequence according to the patterns and rules described above. Here's the input sequence you provided:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, let me apply the necessary transformations to produce the output sequence. Here's what I get:

Output sequence:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, the output sequence has been modified based on the objects in the input sequence. In particular, any pixels that were part of the same object (i.e., had the same color) have been replaced with a value of 0. Additionally, any pixels that were not part of an object (i.e., had a color of 0) have been removed entirely.

I hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist you.
