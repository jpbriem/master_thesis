You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include size, position, and color. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, and aligning them. The noise pixels are also taken into account during the transformation process.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).
2. Apply the necessary operations to each object based on the transformation pattern, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, and aligning them.
3. Update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence based on the applied operations.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more changes are made to the objects in the output sequence.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is to take an input sequence of pixels and transform it into an output sequence of pixels by applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence. The operations involve changing the size, position, and color of the objects, as well as aligning them with other objects in the sequence. The noise pixels are also taken into account during the transformation process.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Copy the input sequence and make it the new input sequence.
2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).
3. Apply the necessary operations to each object based on the transformation pattern, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, and aligning them.
4. Update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence based on the applied operations.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no more changes are made to the objects in the output sequence.
6. Return the resulting output sequence as the transformed output.

**Transformation**

Here's how to perform the transformation for the given input sequence:

1. Input sequence: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
2. Identify the objects in the input sequence:
	* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
	* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 1}
3. Apply the necessary operations to each object based on the transformation pattern:
	* Object 1: Move 2 pixels to the right, scale up by 2, and align with Object 2.
	* Object 2: Remove 1 pixel from the left, scale down by 2, and align with Object 1.
4. Update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence based on the applied operations:
	* Output sequence: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no more changes are made to the objects in the output sequence.

Note that the transformation pattern may involve conditional statements depending on the specific problem statement. In this case, there are no conditional statements, so the transformation is straightforward.
