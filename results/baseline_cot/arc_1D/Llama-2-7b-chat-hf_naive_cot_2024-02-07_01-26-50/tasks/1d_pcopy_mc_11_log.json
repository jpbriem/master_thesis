The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9, where each integer represents a different pixel color or background. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the noise pixels are represented by zeros. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, and aligning objects.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right.\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double their size).\n3. Hollow out the objects in the input sequence by replacing them with zeros.\n4. Copy the remaining non-zero elements in the input sequence and paste them after the last object.\n5. Recolor the copied elements to match the color of the next object.\n6. Align the objects in the output sequence horizontally.\n7. Sort the elements in the output sequence according to their color.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation for each step:\n\nStep 1: Move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right.\n\nIn the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the objects are located at positions `1` and `3`. To move these objects to the right, we simply shift the entire sequence to the right by one position. So, the output sequence for this input sequence would be `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nStep 2: Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions.\n\nIn the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the objects are already scaled by a factor of 2 in both directions. Therefore, there is no need to scale them further.\n\nStep 3: Hollow out the objects in the input sequence by replacing them with zeros.\n\nIn the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the objects are represented by non-zero elements in the sequence. To hollow out the objects, we replace these non-zero elements with zeros. So, the output sequence for this input sequence would be `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nStep 4: Copy the remaining non-zero elements in the input sequence and paste them after the last object.\n\nIn the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, there are still some non-zero elements left in the sequence after hollowing out the objects. To copy these remaining elements and paste them after the last object, we simply concatenate the input sequence with a duplicate copy of itself. So, the output sequence for this input sequence would be `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,"
