The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 8 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 8 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are two objects in the output sequence. The objects are aligned horizontally and vertically, and they do not overlap.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are three objects in the output sequence. The objects are aligned horizontally and vertically, and they do not overlap.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are four objects in the output sequence. The objects are aligned horizontally and vertically, and they do not overlap.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple scaling operation, where each pixel value is multiplied by a constant factor. This would result in a linear transformation, where the input sequence is stretched or shrunk by a fixed amount.\n\nNow, let's consider how to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions. Here are the steps involved:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: Since there are no objects in the input sequence provided, we will assume that there are no objects in the new input sequence as well.\n2. Determine the size of each object: Since there are no objects in the input sequence, we cannot determine their size. Therefore, we will set the size of each object to 1 pixel.\n3. Align the objects horizontally and vertically: Since there are no objects in the input sequence, we cannot align them horizontally and vertically. Therefore, we will assume that the objects are randomly placed in the output sequence.\n4. Check for overlap: Since there are no objects in the input sequence, there is no possibility of overlap between objects. Therefore, we will assume that the objects do not overlap in the output sequence as well.\n5. Apply the scaling operation: Finally, we will apply the scaling operation to the input sequence, where each pixel value is multiplied by a constant factor. This will result in the output sequence, where each pixel value is stretched or shrunk by the same amount.\n\nUsing these steps, we can transform any new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Here is an example of how we can apply these steps to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. Since there are no objects in the input sequence, we will assume that there are no objects in the new input sequence as well.\n\nStep 2: Determine the size of each object. Since there are no objects in the input sequence, we cannot determine their size. Therefore, we will set the size of each object to 1 pixel.\n\nStep 3: Align the objects horizontally and vertically. Since there are no objects in the input sequence, we cannot align them horizontally and vertically. Therefore, we will assume that the objects are randomly placed in the output sequence.\n\nStep 4: Check for overlap. Since there are no objects in the input sequence, there is no possibility of overlap between objects. Therefore, we will assume that the objects do not overlap in the output sequence as well.\n\nStep 5: Apply the scaling operation. Finally, we will apply the scaling operation to the input sequence, where each pixel value is multiplied by a constant factor. This will result in the output sequence, where each pixel value is stretched or shrunk by the same amount.\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, we can conclude that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple scaling operation, where each pixel value is multiplied by a constant factor. By applying this transformation action repeatedly to a new input sequence, we can transform it into its corresponding output sequence."
