You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are two objects in the output sequence (Object_1 and Object_2). Object_1 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], and Object_2 is located at positions [4, 5, 6]. The size of Object_1 is 2x2, and the size of Object_2 is 1x1.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are three objects in the output sequence (Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3). Object_1 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], Object_2 is located at positions [4, 5, 6], and Object_3 is located at positions [7, 8, 9]. The size of Object_1 is 2x2, the size of Object_2 is 1x1, and the size of Object_3 is 1x1.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are two objects in the output sequence (Object_1 and Object_2). Object_1 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], and Object_2 is located at positions [4, 5, 6]. The size of Object_1 is 2x2, and the size of Object_2 is 1x1.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation from input to output involves moving, scaling, and aligning objects in the input sequence to their corresponding positions in the output sequence. Additionally, there may be some arithmetical operations involved, such as counting and sorting, to determine the final positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence.

Now, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence. Given the input sequence:
```json
[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
From the given input sequence, we can identify two objects: Object_1 and Object_2. Object_1 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], and Object_2 is located at positions [4, 5, 6]. The size of Object_1 is 2x2, and the size of Object_2 is 1x1.

To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Move Object_1 to position [1, 2, 3] in the output sequence.
2. Scale Object_1 to a size of 2x2 in the output sequence.
3. Align Object_2 to position [4, 5, 6] in the output sequence.
4. Scale Object_2 to a size of 1x1 in the output sequence.
5. Sort the remaining pixels in the output sequence based on their positions.

The resulting output sequence would be:
```json
[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Note that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and the pixels values are still between 0 and 9.

Therefore, the transformation rule from input to output can be represented as follows:

Input â†’ Output = Move + Scale + Align + Sort

Where "Move" refers to moving an object to its correct position in the output sequence, "Scale" refers to resizing an object to its correct size in the output sequence, "Align" refers to aligning objects to their correct positions in the output sequence, and "Sort" refers to sorting the remaining pixels in the output sequence based on their positions.
