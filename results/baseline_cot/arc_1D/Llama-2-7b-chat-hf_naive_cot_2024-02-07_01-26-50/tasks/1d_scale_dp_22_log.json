            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn the input sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], there are two objects:\n\nObject 1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\nObject 2: {color: 1, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}\n\nStep 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object\n\nFor Object 1, we need to apply the following rules:\n\n* Move 2 positions to the right (i.e., from index 1 to index 3)\n* Scale by a factor of 2 (i.e., double the size)\n* Remove the middle pixel (i.e., the one at index 2)\n\nSo, the transformed Object 1 looks like this:\n\n{color: 1, start_index: 3, end_index: 5, size: 4}\n\nFor Object 2, we need to apply the following rules:\n\n* Move 1 position to the left (i.e., from index 5 to index 4)\n* Scale by a factor of 2 (i.e., double the size)\n* Overlap with Object 1 by shifting the latter to the right by 1 pixel\n\nSo, the transformed Object 2 looks like this:\n\n{color: 1, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 4}\n\nStep 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more objects remain\n\nIn the output sequence, we want to repeat these transformations until no more objects remain in the input sequence. So, we iterate through the input sequence again and again, applying the transformation rules to each object until there are no more objects left.\n\nHere's what the final output sequence would look like:\n\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nNote that the order of the pixels in the output sequence is the same as in the input sequence, but the sizes and positions of the objects have been modified according to the transformation rules.\n\nThat's it! This is how I would approach this problem. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
