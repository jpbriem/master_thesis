The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some changes in their sizes and positions. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been reduced in size by half, and some of them have been moved horizontally by one pixel. Additionally, two noise pixels have been added at the beginning and end of the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of a single large object occupying most of the sequence length, with some noise pixels at the beginning and end. The output sequence consists of multiple smaller objects, each separated by a few noise pixels. Each small object has been created by dividing the original large object into smaller parts, and some of these parts have been rotated or mirrored.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of a single large object occupying most of the sequence length, with some noise pixels at the beginning and end. The output sequence consists of multiple smaller objects, each separated by a few noise pixels. However, unlike Example 2, these smaller objects do not necessarily match the original large object exactly; instead, they seem to be randomly generated based on the original object's shape and size.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves resizing, shifting, and possibly rotating/mirroring objects in the input sequence. Additionally, there may be some randomness involved in creating the output objects, especially in Example 3.\n\nNow, let me apply these insights to transform a new input sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I will follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are three objects, each represented by a non-zero value.\n\nStep 2: Resize each object by reducing its size by half. This means that each object will be shrunk by half in both x and y directions.\n\nStep 3: Shift each object horizontally by one pixel. This means that each object will be moved to the right by one pixel relative to its original position.\n\nStep 4: Rotate each object by 90 degrees clockwise. This means that each object will be turned by 90 degrees counterclockwise relative to its original orientation.\n\nStep 5: Mirror each object vertically. This means that each object will be flipped over its vertical axis, so that the top becomes the bottom and vice versa.\n\nStep 6: Add noise pixels at the beginning and end of the output sequence. This means that we will add two noise pixels at the starting and ending indices of the output sequence.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the transformed output sequence would look like this:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAs expected, the output sequence contains fewer objects than the input sequence, and each object has been modified in terms of size, position, rotation, and reflection.\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern involving the given examples can be summarized as follows:\n\n* Resize objects by reducing their size by half.\n* Shift objects horizontally by one pixel.\n* Rotate objects by 90 degrees clockwise.\n* Mirror objects vertically.\n* Add noise pixels at the beginning and end of the output sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
