The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom the input sequence, we can see that there are three objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 5, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\nThe output sequence simply repeats the input sequence without any changes. Therefore, the transformation pattern for this pair is simply copying the input sequence unchanged.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: `[3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nAgain, there are three objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n* Object 3: {color: 3, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\nHowever, unlike the previous example, the output sequence has been modified by repeating each object twice. This suggests that the transformation pattern for this pair involves scaling the objects by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: `[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this case, there are four objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 2, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 6, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n* Object 4: {color: 6, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}\n\nThe output sequence again repeats the input sequence without any changes, but with each object scaled up by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n\nNow, let's consider the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nThere are three objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 0, end_index: 2, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n* Object 3: {color: 7, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Copy the input sequence unchanged.\n\nStep 2: Scale each object in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n\nStep 3: Repeat each scaled object twice in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this task is:\n\nInput \u2192 Copy \u2192 Scale \u2192 Repeat\n\nFinally, the output sequence for the given input sequence would be:\n\nOutput: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`\n\nI hope this helps you understand the task better! Let me know if you have any further questions."
