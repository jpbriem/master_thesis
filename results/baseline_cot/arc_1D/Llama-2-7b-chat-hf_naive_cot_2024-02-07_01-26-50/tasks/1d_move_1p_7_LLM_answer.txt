[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

<</SYS>>
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem! Here's my answer:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties (such as size, position, and color) can be accessed through the `Object` description field.

The transformation pattern between the input and output sequences appears to be based on the following rules:

* Movement: Pixels can move left or right by one position.
* Hollowing: A pixel can become hollow if it has no neighboring pixels of the same color.
* Scaling: A pixel can be scaled up or down by a factor of 2.
* Removal: A pixel can be removed if it is the only pixel of its color in the sequence.
* Copying: A pixel can be copied from another position in the sequence.
* Recoloring: A pixel can change its color to any other color in the sequence.

These rules can be applied iteratively to transform the input sequence into the output sequence.

**Overall Pattern**

Based on the given examples, it seems that the overall pattern of the transformation is to move pixels around, resize them, and sometimes remove or recolor them. However, without more information about the specific problem, it's difficult to provide a more detailed explanation of the overall pattern.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Apply the transformation rules to each pixel in the input sequence, moving, resizing, removing, copying, and recoloring as necessary.
3. Add the transformed pixels to the output sequence, starting at the appropriate position.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire input sequence has been transformed and added to the output sequence.

**Transformation**

Here are the details of the transformation process for each type of object in the input sequence:

* **Objects:**
	+ Move: If an object has no neighboring pixels of the same color, it can be moved left or right by one position.
	+ Hollow: If an object has no neighboring pixels of the same color, it can become hollow.
	+ Scale: An object can be scaled up or down by a factor of 2.
	+ Remove: An object can be removed if it is the only pixel of its color in the sequence.
	+ Copy: An object can be copied from another position in the sequence.
	+ Recolor: An object can change its color to any other color in the sequence.
* **Noise Pixels:**
	+ Ignore: Noise pixels are simply ignored during the transformation process.

**Test Output**

Using the provided input sequence `[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we can apply the transformation rules to generate the corresponding output sequence:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "Regarding the first example, the input sequence [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0] was transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0] by moving some pixels left or right.",
    "Example_2": "..."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "...",
  "instructions": "...",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
    "object_description": {
      "Example_1": {
        "size": 4,
        "position": 0,
        "color": 4
      }
    },
    "transformed_objects": {
      "Example_1": {
        "size": 4,
        "position": 0,
        "color": 4
      }
    },
    "output": "[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]"
  },
  "test_output": "[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]"
}
```
Note that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, but the positions of the pixels may have changed due to the application of the transformation rules.
