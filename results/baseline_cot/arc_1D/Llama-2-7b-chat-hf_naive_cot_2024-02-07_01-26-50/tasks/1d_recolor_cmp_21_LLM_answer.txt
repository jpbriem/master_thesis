You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero elements) and noise pixels (represented by zero elements). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been reduced in size by half, and some noise pixels have been removed.
* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, in this case, some objects have been rotated by 90 degrees clockwise, while others have remained unchanged.
* Example_3: This is the most complex example so far, where the input sequence consists of a mix of objects and noise pixels, along with some additional features such as gaps and overlaps between objects. In the output sequence, some objects have been resized, moved, or rotated, while others have remained unchanged.

Based on these observations, it seems that the underlying transformation pattern involves modifying the size, position, and orientation of objects in the input sequence to create the corresponding output sequence. Additionally, there may be some noise reduction or other feature extraction techniques involved.

Now, let's apply these insights to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:
```markdown
input = [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
```
To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: There are three objects in the input sequence, each represented by a non-zero element.
2. Modify the size of each object: Each object in the input sequence has a size of 8 pixels. To transform the objects into the output sequence, we need to reduce their size by half. So, the first object becomes 4 pixels wide, the second object becomes 6 pixels wide, and the third object remains unchanged at 8 pixels wide.
3. Move the objects to their correct positions: The objects in the input sequence are not aligned properly. We need to move them to their correct positions in the output sequence. For example, the first object should be moved two positions to the right, the second object should be moved one position down, and the third object should remain in its original position.
4. Rotate the objects: Some objects in the input sequence have been rotated by 90 degrees clockwise. To maintain consistency with the other examples, we will rotate each object in the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise to create the corresponding object in the output sequence.
5. Remove excess noise pixels: Finally, we need to remove any excess noise pixels in the input sequence that do not correspond to any object. In this case, there are several noise pixels at the beginning and end of the input sequence that we can safely remove.

After applying these transformations, our output sequence would look like this:
```markdown
output = [0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
```
Therefore, the transformation rule for this problem can be summarized as follows:

Transformation Rule: Given an input sequence consisting of objects and noise pixels, modify the size, position, and orientation of the objects to create the corresponding output sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
