The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 8, while the output sequence has a repeating pattern of 2s and 3s. Moreover, there are two objects in the input sequence - one starting at index 1 and ending at index 2, and another starting at index 5 and ending at index 6. These objects are not present in the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, the input sequence again consists of alternating values of 0 and 8, but the output sequence has a different repeating pattern of 3s and 9s. There are no objects present in the input sequence, but there are three objects in the output sequence - one starting at index 1 and ending at index 2, another starting at index 4 and ending at index 5, and the last one starting at index 7 and ending at index 8.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this final example, both the input and output sequences consist of alternating values of 0 and 8, without any objects present. However, the output sequence has a different repeating pattern than the previous examples, with a focus on multiples of 3.\n\nNow, based on these observations, I will attempt to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions:\n\n1. Move: This action involves shifting an object by a fixed number of positions along the sequence. In the given examples, we did not observe any moves, so I will not apply this action.\n2. Hollow: This action involves removing an object from the sequence. Since we did not observe any hollow objects in the given examples, I will not apply this action.\n3. Scale: This action involves multiplying the size of an object by a constant factor. We did not observe any scaling operations in the given examples, so I will not apply this action.\n4. Remove: This action involves deleting an object from the sequence. As mentioned earlier, we did not observe any removed objects in the given examples, so I will not apply this action.\n5. Copy: This action involves creating a duplicate of an object in the sequence. We observed one instance of copying in Example 1, where an object was copied from index 1 to index 2. Therefore, I will apply this action when necessary.\n6. Recolor: This action involves changing the color of an object in the sequence. We did not observe any recoloring operations in the given examples, so I will not apply this action.\n7. Sort: This action involves arranging the objects in the sequence according to some criteria. We did not observe any sorting operations in the given examples, so I will not apply this action.\n\nBased on the above analysis and considerations, I will now attempt to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions. Please provide me with a new input sequence, and I will update this answer accordingly."
