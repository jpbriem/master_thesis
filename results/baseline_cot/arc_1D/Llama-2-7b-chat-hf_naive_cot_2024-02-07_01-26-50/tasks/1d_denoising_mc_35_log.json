The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and removing objects.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right.\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 0.5 in both directions (i.e., shrink them by half in width and height).\n3. Remove any object that overlaps with another object by checking if their intersection is non-empty. If they do overlap, remove the smaller object.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence.\n\nHere's an example of how these steps would work for the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nStep 1: Move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right.\n\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nStep 2: Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 0.5 in both directions.\n\nOutput: `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 8.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]`\n\nStep 3: Remove any object that overlaps with another object by checking if their intersection is non-empty. If they do overlap, remove the smaller object.\n\nOutput: `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 8.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]`\n\nRepeating these steps until there are no more objects left in the input sequence gives us the output sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to iteratively apply operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and removing objects, until there are no more objects left. Each operation affects the entire input sequence simultaneously, without considering the individual pixels or colors.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence as the starting point for the transformation.\n2. Apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence, using the rules provided earlier.\n3. Output the resulting transformed sequence as the final result.\n\n**Transformation**\n\n* **Input:** Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n* **Object Description:** Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n\t+ Object 1: {size: 6, position: [0, 0], color: 6}\n\t+ Object 2: {size: 6, position: [2, 0], color: 6}\n\t+ Object 3: {size: 6, position: [4, 0], color: 6}\n\t+ Object 4: {size: 6, position: [6, 0], color: 6}\n* **Transformed Objects:** Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n\t+ Transformed Object 1: {size: 6, position: [0, 0], color: 6}\n\t+ Transformed Object 2: {size: 6, position: [2, 0], color: 6}\n\t+ Transformed Object 3: {size: 6, position: [4, 0], color: 6}\n\t+ Transformed Object 4: {size: 6, position: [6, 0], color: 6}\n* **Output:** Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
