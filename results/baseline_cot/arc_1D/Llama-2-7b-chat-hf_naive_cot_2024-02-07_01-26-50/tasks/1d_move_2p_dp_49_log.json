The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (7 and 5), while the output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (7 and 5) as well. There is no obvious pattern in the input sequence that could lead to the output sequence.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (4 and 5), while the output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (4 and 5) again. This time, there is an obvious pattern in the input sequence where every other element is flipped to become the corresponding element in the output sequence.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (2 and 5), while the output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (2 and 5) once more. Similar to the previous example, there is an obvious pattern in the input sequence where every other element is flipped to become the corresponding element in the output sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern between input and output involves flipping every other element in the input sequence to create the corresponding element in the output sequence. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple bitwise XOR operation:\n\nInput \u2192 Output = Input ^^ 2\n\nUsing this transformation rule, we can now transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence as follows:\n\nTest Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTransformed Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nAs requested, here is the description of the transformation actions required to transform a new input into its output:\n\n1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\n2. Apply a bitwise XOR operation to each element in the input sequence to obtain the corresponding element in the output sequence.\n\nFinally, here is the JSON response for the test case:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"No change occurred in the input sequence.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"Every other element in the input sequence was flipped to become the corresponding element in the output sequence.\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"bitwise XOR\",\n\"instructions\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task, apply a bitwise XOR operation to each element to obtain the corresponding element in the output sequence.\",\n\"transformation\": {\"input\": \"[copy the test case input sequence from the task]\", \"object_description\": \"no objects\", \"transformed_objects\": \"no objects\", \"output\": \"[apply a bitwise XOR operation to each element]\" },\n\"test_output\": \"[return the resulting test output sequence]\"\n}"
