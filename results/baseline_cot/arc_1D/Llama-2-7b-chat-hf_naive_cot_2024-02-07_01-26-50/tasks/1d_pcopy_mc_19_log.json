The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, rotating, and merging objects.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. **Move**: Shift the entire input sequence by 1 pixel to the right.\n2. **Scale**: Multiply each pixel value in the input sequence by a factor of 2.\n3. **Rotate**: Rotate the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise.\n4. **Merge**: Merge adjacent pixels of the same color in the input sequence to form larger objects.\n5. **Remove**: Remove any pixel that is not part of an object.\n6. **Recolor**: Replace each pixel value in the input sequence with the average color of the surrounding pixels.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation of each step:\n\n1. **Move**: The input sequence is shifted by 1 pixel to the right, effectively moving the entire sequence one position to the right. This step helps to align the objects in the input sequence properly.\n2. **Scale**: Each pixel value in the input sequence is multiplied by a factor of 2, effectively doubling the size of each object in the sequence. This step helps to enlarge the objects in the sequence and create more space between them.\n3. **Rotate**: The input sequence is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise, effectively changing the orientation of the objects in the sequence. This step helps to mix up the objects in the sequence and create new patterns.\n4. **Merge**: Any two adjacent pixels of the same color in the input sequence are merged into a single pixel. This step helps to combine smaller objects in the sequence into larger ones.\n5. **Remove**: Any pixel that is not part of an object in the input sequence is removed, effectively thinning out the sequence and creating more space between the remaining objects.\n6. **Recolor**: Each pixel value in the input sequence is replaced with the average color of the surrounding pixels. This step helps to blend the objects in the sequence together and create a more uniform color distribution.\n\nBy applying these steps, we can transform the input sequence into the output sequence, which consists of larger, more complex objects with a more uniform color distribution.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to iteratively apply a series of operations to the input sequence, gradually modifying it into the output sequence. Each operation modifies the sequence in a specific way, either by shifting, scaling, rotating, merging, removing, or recoloring pixels. By combining these operations in a particular order, we can create the desired transformation pattern.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these instructions:\n\n1. Initialize the output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Apply the move operation to the input sequence, shifting it by 1 pixel to the right.\n3. Scale each pixel value in the input sequence by a factor of 2.\n4. Rotate the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise.\n5. Merge any two adjacent pixels of the same color in the input sequence.\n6. Remove any pixel that is not part of an object in the input sequence.\n7. Recolor each pixel value in the input sequence with the average color of the surrounding pixels.\n8. Write the modified output sequence, starting from the original input sequence.\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be able to transform any input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation pattern."
