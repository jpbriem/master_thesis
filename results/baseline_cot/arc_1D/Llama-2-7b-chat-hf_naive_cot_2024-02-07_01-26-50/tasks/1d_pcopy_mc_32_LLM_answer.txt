You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been scaled up by a factor of 2, and some noise pixels have been removed.
* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, in this case, each object has been aligned horizontally with respect to its neighboring objects. Additionally, some noise pixels have been removed.
* Example_3: This is the most complex input-output pair provided. The input sequence consists of a mix of objects and noise pixels, with some objects overlapping with each other. The output sequence again consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been resized by a factor of 2, and some noise pixels have been removed.

Based on these observations, I can make the following assumptions about the input-output relationship:

1. The input sequence consists of objects and noise pixels, while the output sequence consists of objects and noise pixels with some modifications.
2. The modifications made to the output sequence involve scaling, aligning, and removing noise pixels.
3. The objects in the input sequence are distinct and do not overlap with each other.

Now, let me provide my answer to the questions asked:

* Description:
	+ Regarding the first example, the difference between the input and output sequences lies in the scaling factor applied to each object. In the input sequence, each object has a size of 1, while in the output sequence, each object has a size of 2.
	+ Regarding the second example, the difference between the input and output sequences lies in the horizontal alignment of the objects. In the input sequence, the objects are randomly placed, while in the output sequence, they are aligned horizontally with respect to their neighboring objects.
	+ Regarding the third example, the difference between the input and output sequences lies in the resizing of the objects. In the input sequence, each object has a size of 1, while in the output sequence, each object has a size of 2.
* Overall pattern: The overall pattern in the input-output relationships is that the input sequence consists of objects and noise pixels, while the output sequence consists of objects and noise pixels with some modifications. These modifications involve scaling, aligning, and removing noise pixels.
* Instructions: To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:
	1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.
	2. Scale each object in the input sequence by a factor of 2.
	3. Align the objects in the input sequence horizontally with respect to their neighboring objects.
	4. Remove any noise pixels in the input sequence.
	5. Output the resulting sequence.
* Transformation:
	Input: Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!
	Object description: Focus on the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence.
	Transformed objects: Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
	Output: Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!
* Test output: Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional clarification.
