You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their starting and ending indices in the sequence.

The transformation from input to output involves several operations, including moving, scaling, and removing objects. The exact rules for these operations are as follows:

* Move an object by k pixels if the object is at position i and the next pixel after position i is not part of any other object.
* Scale an object by a factor of k if the object is at position i and the next pixel after position i is not part of any other object.
* Remove an object if it has no neighboring objects at the same position.

Based on these rules, we can deduce the following steps to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions.
Step 2: Move each object by one pixel towards the right (or left) if there is no object at the next position.
Step 3: Scale each object by a factor of 2 if there is no object at the next position.
Step 4: Remove any object that has no neighboring objects at the same position.

By applying these steps, we can transform the input sequence into the output sequence. Here's the detailed explanation of each step:

Step 1: Identifying objects and determining their sizes and positions

In the input sequence, the objects are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color. We need to identify these objects and determine their sizes and positions in the sequence. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, the objects are `Object_1` (size=2, position=[1, 2]) and `Object_2` (size=1, position=[4, 5]).

Step 2: Moving objects towards the right (or left)

If there is no object at the next position, we move the current object by one pixel towards the right (or left). This ensures that the objects do not overlap with each other. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, we would move `Object_1` by one pixel towards the right after the second pixel.

Step 3: Scaling objects by a factor of 2

If there is no object at the next position, we scale the current object by a factor of 2. This ensures that the objects remain distinct and do not merge with each other. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, we would scale `Object_1` by a factor of 2 after the third pixel.

Step 4: Removing objects that have no neighboring objects at the same position

We remove any object that has no neighboring objects at the same position. This ensures that the objects are well-defined and do not overlap with each other. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, we would remove `Object_2` because it does not have any neighboring objects at the same position.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is to move, scale, and remove objects based on their positions and distances from each other. By applying these operations recursively, we can transform the input sequence into the output sequence.

**Transformation**

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following transformation steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions.
2. Move each object by one pixel towards the right (or left) if there is no object at the next position.
3. Scale each object by a factor of 2 if there is no object at the next position.
4. Remove any object that has no neighboring objects at the same position.

Here's the detailed transformation process for the given input sequence:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "Regarding the first example, the input sequence contains two objects: Object_1 (size=2, position=[1, 2]) and Object_2 (size=1, position=[4, 5]). After applying the transformation, the output sequence contains two objects: Object_1 (size=2, position=[1, 2]) and Object_2 (size=1, position=[4, 5]).",
    "Example_2": "..."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Move, scale, and remove objects based on their positions and distances from each other.",
  "instructions": "Apply the following transformation steps to transform a new input sequence into its output sequence:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions.
2. Move each object by one pixel towards the right (or left) if there is no object at the next position.
3. Scale each object by a factor of 2 if there is no object at the next position.
4. Remove any object that has no neighboring objects at the same position.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]",
    "object_description": "Regarding the test input, the objects are:

* Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
* Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}"
    "transformed_objects": "After applying the transformation, the objects in the output sequence are:

* Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
* Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}"
    "output": "[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]"
  }
}
```
Note that the transformation process is recursive, meaning that we apply the same operations to each object in the sequence until the entire sequence has been transformed.
