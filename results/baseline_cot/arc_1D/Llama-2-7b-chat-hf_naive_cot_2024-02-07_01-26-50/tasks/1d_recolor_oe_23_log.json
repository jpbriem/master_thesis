            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the objects are either moved, resized, or aligned with each other. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the transformation works:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to the second position (from index 1 to index 2).\nStep 2: Resize object 2 to half its original size (from index 4 to index 5).\nStep 3: Align object 3 with object 1 (from index 8 to index 9).\nStep 4: Remove object 4 (from index 6 to index 7).\nStep 5: Scale object 5 to twice its original size (from index 3 to index 4).\nStep 6: Copy object 6 and place it after object 5 (from index 10 to index 11).\nStep 7: Move object 7 to the last position (from index 7 to index 12).\n\nUsing these steps, we can transform the input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] into the output sequence [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0].\n\nNow, let me provide more detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation for any given input sequence:\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list `transformed_objects` to store the modified objects.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence indices from left to right.\n3. At each iteration, apply the appropriate transformation rule based on the current object (if any) and its position in the sequence.\n4. If the current object has been removed or resized, add its updated properties to the `transformed_objects` list.\n5. Repeat step 3 until the end of the input sequence is reached.\n6. Return the `transformed_objects` list as the output sequence.\n\nFor example, if the input sequence is [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we would apply the following transformations:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to the second position (from index 1 to index 2), so the updated `transformed_objects` list becomes `[{color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}]`.\nStep 2: Resize object 2 to half its original size (from index 4 to index 5), so the updated `transformed_objects` list becomes `[{color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1/2}]`.\nStep 3: Align object 3 with object 1 (from index 8 to index 9), so the updated `transformed_objects` list becomes `[{color: 2, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1}, {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}]`.\nAnd so on.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
