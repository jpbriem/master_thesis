prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and recoloring objects. Here's my interpretation of the transformation pattern:

Input-Output Pattern:

* The input sequence consists of a series of pixels, where each pixel has a color value between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
* The output sequence is obtained by applying a series of operations to the input sequence, where each operation corresponds to a specific rule.
* Each operation modifies the color value of one or more pixels in the input sequence, based on their positions and properties.
* The final output sequence contains the same number of pixels as the input sequence, but with modified color values.

Rules for Transforming Input Sequence:

1. Move an object: If there is an object in the input sequence with a non-zero size, move it to a random position in the output sequence.
2. Scale an object: If there is an object in the input sequence with a non-zero size, scale it by a random factor between 0.5 and 2.
3. Recolor an object: If there is an object in the input sequence with a color value other than 0, change its color value to a random value between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
4. Add noise: Add a random noise pixel to the output sequence.
5. Apply conditions: If there is a condition in the input sequence, apply it to the output sequence.

Here's an example of how these rules could be applied to transform the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:

1. Move an object: There is no object in the input sequence with a non-zero size, so none of these rules apply.
2. Scale an object: None of the pixels in the input sequence have a non-zero size, so none of these rules apply.
3. Recolor an object: Pixel 0 has a color value of 3, so we randomly change its color value to 7.
4. Add noise: We add a random noise pixel with a color value of 5.
5. Apply conditions: There are no conditions in the input sequence, so none of these rules apply.

The resulting output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In general, the transformation pattern involves applying a combination of moves, scales, recolors, and adds noise to the input sequence, while also applying conditions if they exist. The exact application of these rules depends on the specific input sequence and the desired output sequence.
