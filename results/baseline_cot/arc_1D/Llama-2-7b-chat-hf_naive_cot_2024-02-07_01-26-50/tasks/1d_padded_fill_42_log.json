The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 5, while the output sequence also consists of alternating values of 0 and 5, but with each occurrence of 5 being followed by another occurrence of 5. This suggests that the transformation rule is simply duplicating every 5th element in the input sequence.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 4, while the output sequence also consists of alternating values of 0 and 4, but with each occurrence of 4 being followed by another occurrence of 4. This suggests that the transformation rule is simply duplicating every 4th element in the input sequence.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 5 and 0, while the output sequence also consists of alternating values of 5 and 0, but with each occurrence of 5 being followed by another occurrence of 5. This suggests that the transformation rule is simply repeating every 5th element in the input sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these transformation rules to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the transformation rules learned from the previous examples, we can transform this input sequence as follows:\n\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 2, just like the input sequence. This suggests that the transformation rule is simply repeating every 2nd element in the input sequence.\n\nTherefore, the overall pattern for transforming an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence appears to be simply duplicating or repeating every nth element in the input sequence, where n is the number of elements between consecutive occurrences of the same value."
