You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.

Firstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 8 ones, while the output sequence consists of 10 zeros and 8 ones again. There is no obvious transformation happening here, so the relation between input and output seems to be simply copying the input sequence without any changes.
* Example_2: In this case, the input sequence has 6 ones and 0 zeros, while the output sequence has 6 ones and 0 zeros again. Again, there doesn't seem to be any transformation happening here.
* Example_3: This is the most interesting case, where the input sequence consists of 3 ones and 3 zeros, while the output sequence consists of 3 ones and 3 zeros again. However, there is a slight change in the positions of the ones and zeros compared to the input sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is simply copying the input sequence without any changes. Therefore, the transformation action for each object in the input sequence can be defined as "no change".

Now, let's consider how to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions. Given an arbitrary input sequence `x`, we can apply the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence `y` of the same length as `x`.
2. For each element `i` in `x`:
a. If `i` is equal to 0, add a 0 to `y` at position `i`.
b. If `i` is equal to 1, add a 1 to `y` at position `i`.
c. Otherwise, do nothing (i.e., keep the value of `i` unchanged).
3. Return `y` as the output sequence.

Here's an example code snippet in Python to illustrate this process:
```python
def transform(x):
    y = []
    for i in x:
        if i == 0:
            y.append(0)
        elif i == 1:
            y.append(1)
        else:
            y.append(i)
    return y
```
Let's test this function with some sample inputs:

* Input: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`
* Output: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`
* Input: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
* Output: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
* Input: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
* Output: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`

As expected, the output sequence is simply a copy of the input sequence without any changes.

Therefore, the final answer for the given input-output pairs is:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 8 ones, while the output sequence consists of 10 zeros and 8 ones again. There is no obvious transformation happening here.",
"Example_2": "..."
},
"overall_pattern": "Copy the input sequence without any changes.",
"instructions": "Transform a new input sequence by copying it without any changes.",
"transformation": {"input": "Copy the test case input sequence from the task.", "object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.", "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.", "output": "Create the resulting test output sequence."},
"test_output": "[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}
