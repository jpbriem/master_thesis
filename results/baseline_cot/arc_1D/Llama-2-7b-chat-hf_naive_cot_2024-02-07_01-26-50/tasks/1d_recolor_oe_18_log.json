The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example 1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some changes in their sizes and positions. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been reduced in size by one pixel, and some of the noise pixels have been moved around to create gaps between the objects.\n* Example 2: Similar to Example 1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, in this case, the objects have been rotated by 90 degrees clockwise relative to the input sequence, and some of the noise pixels have been moved around to create gaps between the objects.\n* Example 3: This is similar to Example 1, but with some additional changes in the positions and sizes of the objects.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the positions, sizes, and orientations of the objects in the input sequence to create the output sequence. Specifically, the objects in the input sequence seem to be subject to the following operations:\n\n* Movement: The objects in the input sequence may be moved leftward or rightward by a fixed number of pixels.\n* Scaling: The objects in the input sequence may be scaled up or down by a factor of 2 or 0.5.\n* Rotation: The objects in the input sequence may be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the input sequence.\n* Gap creation: Gaps may be created between adjacent objects in the input sequence by moving noise pixels into those gaps.\n\nNow, let's apply these operations to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Move the first object leftward by 2 pixels.\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nStep 2: Scale the second object up by a factor of 2.\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 7, 14, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nStep 3: Rotate the third object clockwise by 90 degrees.\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 7, 7, 14, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nStep 4: Create a gap between the fourth and fifth objects by moving a noise pixel into that gap.\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 7, 7, 14, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nRepeat steps 1-4 for the remaining objects in the input sequence, and we get the final output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern involved in this problem is a combination of movement, scaling, rotation, and gap creation operations. These operations are applied recursively to the objects in the input sequence to generate the output sequence."
