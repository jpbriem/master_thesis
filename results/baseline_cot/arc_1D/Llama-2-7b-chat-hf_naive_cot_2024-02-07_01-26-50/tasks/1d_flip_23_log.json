The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zeros, while the output sequence also consists of alternating zeros and non-zeros but with some modifications. Specifically, the non-zero elements in the output sequence are either doubled in value (i.e., 7 becomes 14) or shifted one position to the right (i.e., 7 becomes 8).\n\nExample_2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSimilar to Example_1, the input sequence in this example consists of alternating zeros and non-zeros, while the output sequence has some modifications. Specifically, the non-zero elements in the output sequence are either doubled in value (i.e., 7 becomes 14) or shifted one position to the right (i.e., 7 becomes 8).\n\nExample_3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zeros, while the output sequence has some modifications. Specifically, the non-zero elements in the output sequence are either doubled in value (i.e., 6 becomes 12) or shifted one position to the right (i.e., 6 becomes 7).\n\nNow, based on these observations, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. From the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation rule is simply based on the number of non-zero elements in the input sequence. If there are an odd number of non-zero elements in the input sequence, the corresponding element in the output sequence is doubled in value. Otherwise, if there are an even number of non-zero elements in the input sequence, the corresponding element in the output sequence is shifted one position to the right.\n\nTherefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output can be represented as follows:\n\nInput \u2192 Output = mod(length(input), 2) \u00d7 2\n\nwhere mod(x, y) returns the remainder of x divided by y, and 2 is the factor used to represent the shift operation.\n\nTo demonstrate how to apply this relation to a new input sequence, let's consider the test case provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the above relation, we can calculate the output sequence as follows:\n\nOutput = mod(length(input), 2) \u00d7 2\n= mod(8, 2) \u00d7 2\n= 4 \u00d7 2\n= [4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the output sequence for the given test case is [4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nFinally, based on the given input-output pairs and the instruction to provide the transformation actions, I will outline the steps required to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the length of the input sequence.\nStep 2: Apply the relation between input and output (mod(length(input), 2) \u00d7 2).\nStep 3: Shift the output sequence by the appropriate amount (based on the parity of the length of the input sequence).\n\nBy following these steps, we can transform any new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence."
