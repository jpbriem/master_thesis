The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example 1: The input sequence consists of 11 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 2) at index 6. The output sequence also consists of 11 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 2) at index 6. Therefore, there is no change in the positions of the non-zero elements.\n* Example 2: The input sequence consists of 11 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 7) at index 7. The output sequence also consists of 11 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 7) at index 7. Again, there is no change in the positions of the non-zero elements.\n* Example 3: The input sequence consists of 11 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 5) at index 5. The output sequence also consists of 11 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 5) at index 5. Similarly, there is no change in the positions of the non-zero elements.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input sequence without any changes in position. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one mapping, where each input element is mapped to the corresponding output element.\n\nNow, let's consider a new input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]. To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we simply need to copy each input element to the corresponding output element, without making any changes in position. Here's the transformed output sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule is:\n\nTransformation Rule: Copy each input element to the corresponding output element without making any changes in position.\n\nFinally, here's the requested JSON data structure containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"No changes were made to the non-zero elements in both sequences.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"No changes were made to the non-zero elements in both sequences.\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Copy each input element to the corresponding output element without making any changes in position.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Transform each input element to the corresponding output element without making any changes in position.\",\n\"transformation\": {\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\", \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\", \"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\", \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\" },\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\"\n}"
