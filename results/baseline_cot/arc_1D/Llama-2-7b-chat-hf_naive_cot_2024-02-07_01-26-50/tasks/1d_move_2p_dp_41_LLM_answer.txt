You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In the input sequence [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], there are two objects:

Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}

Step 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object

For Object 1, we need to apply the following rules:

* Move one position to the right (i.e., from index 1 to index 2)
* Scale by a factor of 2 (i.e., double the size)
* Remove the object at index 3 (since it is outside the range of the object)

So, the updated state of Object 1 after applying these rules is:

{color: 2, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 4}

For Object 2, we don't need to apply any rules since it already has the correct position and size.

Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more objects remain

Since there are still two objects left in the input sequence after applying step 2, we need to repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more objects remain. This means we will continue applying the transformation rules to Object 1 until it is removed from the sequence, and then apply the rules to Object 2.

Step 4: Output the transformed sequence

Once all objects have been transformed, we can output the resulting sequence. In this case, the output sequence is:

[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]

Note that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and the positions of the objects in the output sequence match the positions of the objects in the input sequence.

Overall pattern:

The overall pattern of the transformation appears to involve moving objects one position to the right, scaling them by a factor of 2, and removing them if they are outside the range of the object. These operations are applied repeatedly until no more objects remain in the input sequence.
