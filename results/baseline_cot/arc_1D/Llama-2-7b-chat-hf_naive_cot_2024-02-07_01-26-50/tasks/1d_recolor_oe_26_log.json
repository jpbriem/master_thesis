The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to position 2.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of object 1 is less than the starting index of object 2 (which is 0), we need to move object 1 to position 2. To do this, we simply shift the entire object 1 to the right by 2 positions.\n\nStep 2: Scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 6. We need to scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, so we double its size in each direction. This means that the width of object 2 becomes twice its original width, and the height becomes twice its original height.\n\nStep 3: Remove object 3.\n\nIn the input sequence, there is an object at position 8 with a size of 1. Since this object is smaller than the other objects in the sequence, we can safely remove it without affecting the overall structure of the sequence.\n\nStep 4: Recolor object 4.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 4 has a color of 0. We need to recolor object 4 to a random color between 1 and 9, inclusive. Let's choose a random number between these bounds and assign it as the new color of object 4.\n\nStep 5: Sort the remaining objects by their starting indices.\n\nAfter applying steps 1-4, we are left with a sequence of objects that may not be sorted in any particular order. However, since the starting indices of the objects are important for the transformation pattern, we need to sort the remaining objects by their starting indices.\n\nStep 6: Apply noise pixels.\n\nTo add some randomness to the transformation process, we can apply noise pixels to the output sequence. Specifically, we can randomly set some of the pixels in the output sequence to a value of 0, while keeping the rest of the pixels unchanged.\n\nAnd that's it! By following these steps, we can transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence. Here's the complete transformation process in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"Move object 1 to position 2, scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, remove object 3, recolor object 4, and sort the remaining objects by their starting indices.\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"Move object 1 to position 2, scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, remove object 3, recolor object 4, and sort the remaining objects by their starting indices.\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"move,scale,remove,recolor,sort\",\n  \"instructions\": \"Transform the input sequence by applying the specified transformation actions in the correct order. Think step by step.\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": \"[{\\\"color\\\": 2, \\\"start_index\\\": 1, \\\"end_index\\\": 2, \\\"size\\\": 2}], [{\\\"color\\\": 3, \\\"start_index\\\": 4, \\\"end_index\\\": 4, \\\"size\\\": 1}]\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"[{\\\"color\\\": 2, \\\"position\\\": 2, \\\"size\\\": 2}, {\\\"color\\\": 3, \\\"position\\\": 4, \\\"size\\\": 1}]\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]\",\n  },\n  \"test_output\": np.array([[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]])\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!
