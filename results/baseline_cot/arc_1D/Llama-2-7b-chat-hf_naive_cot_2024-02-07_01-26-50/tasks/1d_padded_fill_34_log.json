The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will infer the simplest possible relation between input and output and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nRelation Between Input and Output:\nFrom the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are transformed based on certain logical rules. These rules include moving, hollowing, scaling, removing, copying, and recoloring. Additionally, there are noise pixels present in both the input and output sequences. Finally, there are conditions that are applied to determine the transformation rules.\n\nTransformation Steps:\nTo transform the test input sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, we have two objects: Object_1 and Object_2.\n\nStep 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object based on the conditions specified in the problem statement. For Object_1, we need to move it 2 positions to the right, hollow it, and scale it up by a factor of 2. For Object_2, we need to remove it completely.\n\nStep 3: Add noise pixels to the output sequence. We can add 4 noise pixels of random color to the output sequence.\n\nStep 4: Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 until the entire input sequence has been transformed into the output sequence.\n\nTransformed Objects:\nAfter applying the transformation rules, the transformed objects in the output sequence would look like this:\n\nObject_1: {color: 2, start_index: 3, end_index: 5, size: 2}\nObject_2: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}\n\nOverall Pattern:\nBased on the given input-output pairs, the overall pattern of the transformation appears to be a combination of movement, scaling, and removal of objects. The noise pixels added to the output sequence seem to be randomly distributed and do not follow any specific pattern.\n\nInput Sequence:\nCopy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n\nOutput Sequence:\nCreate the resulting test output sequence by applying the transformation rules to the input sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\nInstructions:\nDescribe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, thinking step by step.\n\nTest Output:\nReturn the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!"
