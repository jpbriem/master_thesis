You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2

In the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 4), we need to move Object 1 to position 2.

Step 2: Scale Object 2 by a Factor of 2

Object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. We need to scale Object 2 by a factor of 2, so its size will be doubled.

Step 3: Remove Object 3

Object 3 has a starting index of 6 and an ending index of 6. Since the ending index of Object 3 is equal to its starting index, we can remove it from the sequence since it doesn't contribute anything to the overall pattern.

Step 4: Recolor Object 1 to Color 8

Object 1 has a color of 0, while Object 2 has a color of 3. Since the color of Object 1 needs to be recolored to match the color of Object 2, we need to change the color of Object 1 to 8.

Step 5: Sort the Remaining Pixels

After removing Object 3 and recoloring Object 1, there are 8 remaining pixels in the sequence. These pixels need to be sorted based on their positions in the sequence.

Step 6: Apply Noise Pixels

To add noise to the sequence, we need to randomly replace some of the pixels with random values between 0 and 8. Let's replace the second and fourth pixels with random values between 0 and 8.

Step 7: Transform the Sequence

Finally, we need to transform the entire sequence based on the underlying pattern. This involves applying arithmetical operations to the pixels, such as counting, sorting, and scaling. Specifically, we need to count the number of pixels in each object and divide it by the total number of pixels in the sequence. We also need to sort the pixels based on their positions in the sequence and scale them based on their colors.

Here's the detailed transformation process for the input sequence:

* Move Object 1 to position 2
* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2
* Remove Object 3
* Recolor Object 1 to color 8
* Sort the remaining pixels based on their positions
* Apply noise pixels by replacing the second and fourth pixels with random values between 0 and 8
* Transform the entire sequence based on the underlying pattern

The resulting output sequence would be:

[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Note that the above steps are just one possible way to transform the input sequence into the output sequence. There may be other valid ways to perform the transformation based on the given pattern.
