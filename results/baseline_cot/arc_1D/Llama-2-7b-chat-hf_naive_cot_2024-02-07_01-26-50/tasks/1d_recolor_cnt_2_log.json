The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]\noutput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn each input sequence, there are several distinct objects (represented by consecutive pixels of the same color) that need to be identified. In the given input sequence [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0], the objects are:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 9, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 9, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nBased on the given transformation pattern, we can apply the following transformations to each object in the input sequence:\n\n* Move Object 1 one position to the right (i.e., from index 1 to index 2).\n* Remove Object 2 (since it has a size of 2 and is located at indices 5-6).\n* Scale Object 3 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions (i.e., from size 1 to size 2).\n\nStep 3: Update the positions and sizes of the remaining objects\n\nAfter applying the transformations to Objects 1 and 3, the updated positions and sizes of these objects in the output sequence are:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 9, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 9, start_index: 9, end_index: 10, size: 2}\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 1-3 for the entire input sequence\n\nUsing the above approach, we can identify and manipulate the objects in the entire input sequence, resulting in the desired output sequence.\n\nHere's the complete transformation process in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"Move Object 1 one position to the right, remove Object 2, and scale Object 3 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"Move Object 1 one position to the right, remove Object 2, and scale Object 3 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"Manipulate objects based on their color and spatial relationships with other objects.\",\n  \"instructions\": \"Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color, and apply transformations to them based on the given pattern. Update the positions and sizes of the remaining objects after each transformation.\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": [\n      {\n        \"color\": 9,\n        \"start_index\": 1,\n        \"end_index\": 2,\n        \"size\": 2\n      },\n      {\n        \"color\": 9,\n        \"start_index\": 5,\n        \"end_index\": 6,\n        \"size\": 2\n      },\n      {\n        \"color\": 9,\n        \"start_index\": 8,\n        \"end_index\": 9,\n        \"size\": 1\n      }\n    ],\n    \"transformed_objects\": [\n      {\n        \"color\": 9,\n        \"start_index\": 2,\n        \"end_index\": 3,\n        \"size\": 2\n      },\n      {\n        \"color\": 9,\n        \"start_index\": 9,\n        \"end_index\": 10,\n        \"size\": 2\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"test_output\": \"[0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nNote that this solution assumes that the input and output sequences have the same number of pixels. If the input sequence has fewer pixels than the output sequence, you may need to pad the input sequence with zeros before applying the transformation."
