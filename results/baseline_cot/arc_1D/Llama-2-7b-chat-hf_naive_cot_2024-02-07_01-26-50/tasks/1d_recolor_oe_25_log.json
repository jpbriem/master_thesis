The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been expanded by one pixel in both the horizontal and vertical directions, and the noise pixels have been shifted towards the center of the sequence.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, in this case, the objects have been rotated by 90 degrees clockwise compared to the input sequence.\n* Example_3: This is the most complex example, where the input sequence consists of multiple overlapping objects, along with some noise pixels. The output sequence again consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Each object in the input sequence has been resized by a factor of 2 in both the horizontal and vertical directions, and some of the objects have been moved around.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the size, position, and orientation of the objects in the input sequence, while maintaining their overall structure. Additionally, there may be some noise injection or manipulation involved in the transformation process.\n\nNow, let me apply these insights to the test input sequence provided:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. There are three objects in total, represented by non-zero values.\n\nObject 1: [0, 5, 5, 0]\nObject 2: [5, 5, 5, 0]\nObject 3: [0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nStep 2: Determine the size, position, and orientation of each object in the input sequence. From the observation made earlier, we can see that each object has been expanded by one pixel in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, the size of each object is twice the original size. Also, since the objects are aligned horizontally, their position can be represented by a single value (the center coordinate) for each object. Finally, since the objects are not rotated, their orientation remains unchanged.\n\nObject 1: Center coordinates = [2, 2], Size = [4, 4]\nObject 2: Center coordinates = [6, 2], Size = [4, 4]\nObject 3: Center coordinates = [2, 8], Size = [4, 4]\n\nStep 3: Transform the input sequence using the above information. We need to modify the size, position, and orientation of each object in the input sequence to match the desired output sequence. Here's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, similar to the other examples provided. Note that the size, position, and orientation of each object in the output sequence are consistent with the observed patterns in the input-output pairs provided.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for this problem can be summarized as follows:\n\nRule: Given an input sequence consisting of alternating objects and noise pixels, expand each object by one pixel in both the horizontal and vertical directions, and rotate them by 90 degrees clockwise. Modify the size, position, and orientation of each object accordingly, while maintaining their overall structure."
