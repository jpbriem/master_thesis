The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the relations between them include moving, scaling, and overlapping. The noise pixels are represented by random integers between 0 and 9.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.\n2. Scale the objects by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., horizontally and vertically).\n3. Move the objects towards the center of the sequence by a distance equal to half their original size.\n4. Overlap the objects by shifting them slightly towards each other, so that they partially cover each other.\n5. Remove any remaining noise pixels.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation of each step:\n\n1. **Identify objects and their positions**: In the input sequence, we identify objects by finding consecutive pixels of the same color. We then store their positions in an array called `object_pos`. For example, if the input sequence is `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, the object positions would be `[0, 2, 2]`.\n2. **Scale objects**: We scale each object by a factor of 2 in both directions. This means that the width and height of each object are doubled, while the distance between objects remains unchanged. For example, if an object has a size of 2 pixels before scaling, it will have a size of 4 pixels after scaling.\n3. **Move objects towards the center**: We move each object towards the center of the sequence by a distance equal to half its original size. This means that the center of each object is shifted towards the center of the sequence by half its original distance from the starting point. For example, if an object is initially located at position 2, it will be moved to position 4 after being scaled and centered.\n4. **Overlap objects**: We overlap the objects by shifting them slightly towards each other. Specifically, we add a fraction of the object size to the position of the next object, depending on the distance between them. For example, if two objects are separated by a distance of 3 pixels, we add 0.5 pixels to the position of the second object. This causes the objects to partially cover each other, creating a sense of overlap.\n5. **Remove noise pixels**: Finally, we remove any remaining noise pixels by setting them to 0.\n\n**Transformations**\n\nHere are the transformations we applied to the input sequence to obtain the output sequence:\n\n* Scaled objects by a factor of 2 in both directions\n* Moved objects towards the center of the sequence by a distance equal to half their original size\n* Overlapped objects by shifting them slightly towards each other\n* Removed any remaining noise pixels\n\n**Output sequence**\n\nThe output sequence is simply the transformed input sequence, with the same number of elements but with the following changes:\n\n* Each element is now a scaled version of the original element (i.e., twice the size)\n* Each element is now shifted towards the center of the sequence by a distance equal to half its original size\n* Some elements may be partially covered by neighboring objects due to overlap\n* Any remaining noise pixels are set to 0\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
