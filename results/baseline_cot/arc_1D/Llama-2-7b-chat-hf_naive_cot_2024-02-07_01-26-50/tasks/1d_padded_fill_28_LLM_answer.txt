prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the given examples:

Example 1:
The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been replicated twice in the output sequence, while maintaining their original positions and sizes.

Example 2:
Similar to Example 1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, in this case, each object has been duplicated three times in the output sequence, while maintaining their original positions and sizes.

Example 3:
In this example, the input sequence consists of a single large object surrounded by smaller objects. The output sequence consists of the same large object surrounded by the same smaller objects, but with some modifications. Specifically, each small object has been replicated twice around the large object in the output sequence, while maintaining their original positions and sizes.

Based on these examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves copying and replicating objects in various ways, while maintaining their original positions and sizes. Additionally, there may be some noise pixels present in the input sequence that do not affect the output sequence.

Now, let me apply these insights to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:
```markdown
input = [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
```
To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I will follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects: one with a size of 8 pixels wide and another with a size of 0 pixels wide.

Step 2: Copy each object in the input sequence and replicate it multiple times in the output sequence. Specifically, the large object should be copied four times in the output sequence, while the small object should be copied six times.

Step 3: Position each replicated object in the output sequence according to its original position in the input sequence. This means that the large object should be placed at position 1 in the output sequence, followed by its copies, and the small object should be placed at position 2 in the output sequence, followed by its copies.

Step 4: Fill the remaining gaps in the output sequence with noise pixels.

Here's the transformed output sequence:
```markdown
output = [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
