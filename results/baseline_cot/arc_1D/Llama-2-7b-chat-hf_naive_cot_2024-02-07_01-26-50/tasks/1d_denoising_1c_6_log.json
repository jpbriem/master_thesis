The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zero values, while the output sequence consists of all zeros. This suggests that the transformation rule is simply to replace each non-zero value in the input sequence with a zero value in the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zero values, while the output sequence consists of all zeros. However, there is one exception - the seventh element in the input sequence is replaced by seven copies of itself in the output sequence. This suggests that the transformation rule involves copying a specific element from the input sequence to the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: `[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zero values, while the output sequence consists of all zeros. However, there is one exception - the second element in the input sequence is copied twice in the output sequence. This suggests that the transformation rule involves copying an element from the input sequence to the output sequence multiple times.\n\nNow, let's apply these transformation rules to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]`\n\nUsing the transformation rules learned from the previous examples, we can apply the following steps to transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\n1. Replace each non-zero value in the input sequence with a zero value in the output sequence.\n2. Copy the seventh element in the input sequence (i.e., `8`) to the output sequence.\n3. Repeat the second element in the input sequence (`8`) twice in the output sequence.\n\nThe resulting output sequence would be:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs.\",\n  \"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step.\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\",\n    \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n    \"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence.\"\n  },\n  \"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nNote that the resulting output sequence has all zeros, just like the other output sequences provided. This suggests that the transformation rule is simply to replace each non-zero value in the input sequence with a zero value in the output sequence."
