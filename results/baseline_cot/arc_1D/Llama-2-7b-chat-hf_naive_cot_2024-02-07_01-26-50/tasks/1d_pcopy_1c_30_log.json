The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with each object being larger than the previous one.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, the output sequence has all objects removed, leaving only noise pixels.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of a single object (represented by a sequence of consecutive non-zero values) followed by a sequence of noise pixels. The output sequence consists of the same object repeated multiple times, with each repetition having a smaller size than the previous one.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves scaling down the objects while removing them from the output sequence. Additionally, there may be some sort of condition or rule that determines when an object should be removed or scaled down.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to transform a new input sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:\n```markdown\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nTo transform this input sequence into its output sequence, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: There are two objects in the input sequence, represented by the non-zero values at positions 2 and 6.\n2. Scale down the objects: Since the objects are scaled down in the output sequence, we need to divide their sizes by 2. So, the object at position 2 has a size of 1 now, and the object at position 6 has a size of 4.\n3. Remove the objects: Since the objects are removed from the output sequence, we simply remove them from the input sequence after scaling them down.\n4. Add noise pixels: Finally, we add noise pixels to the remaining parts of the input sequence to create the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformed input sequence would be:\n```markdown\n[0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAnd the corresponding output sequence would be:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAs expected, the output sequence has no objects and only noise pixels.\n\nSo, the transformation pattern for this specific problem is:\n\n* Identify objects in the input sequence\n* Scale down the identified objects\n* Remove the scaled-down objects from the input sequence\n* Add noise pixels to the remaining parts of the input sequence to create the output sequence\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
