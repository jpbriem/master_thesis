            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 5, while the output sequence has a repeating pattern of 0, 4, and 9. Moreover, there are two objects in the input sequence (Object_1: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 5} and Object_2: {color: 5, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 3}). These objects are moved three positions towards the right in the output sequence.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 5, while the output sequence has a repeating pattern of 0, 1, and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: `[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 5, while the output sequence has a repeating pattern of 0, 4, and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can expect the output sequence to have a repeating pattern of 0, 4, and 9. Moreover, there may be one or more objects in the input sequence that need to be transformed.\n\nTransformations:\n\n1. Move Object_1 three positions towards the right in the output sequence.\n2. Scale Object_2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions in the output sequence.\n3. Remove Object_3 from the output sequence.\n\nNew Output Sequence:\n[0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for the given input sequence is:\n\nInput \u2192 Output = [Move Object_1 three positions towards the right, Scale Object_2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, Remove Object_3]\n\nI hope this helps you with your problem! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."
