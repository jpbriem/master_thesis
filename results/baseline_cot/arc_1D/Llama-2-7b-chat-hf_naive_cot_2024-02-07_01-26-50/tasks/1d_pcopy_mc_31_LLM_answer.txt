[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are two objects in the output sequence (Object_1 and Object_2). Object_1 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], and Object_2 is located at positions [6, 7, 8]. The size of Object_1 is 2x2, and the size of Object_2 is 1x1.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are three objects in the input sequence (Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3), and four objects in the output sequence. Object_1 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], Object_2 is located at positions [4, 5, 6], and Object_3 is located at positions [8, 9, 10]. The sizes of Object_1 and Object_2 are 2x2, while the size of Object_3 is 1x1.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are five objects in the input sequence (Object_1, Object_2, Object_3, Object_4, and Object_5), and six objects in the output sequence. Object_1 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], Object_2 is located at positions [4, 5, 6], Object_3 is located at positions [7, 8, 9], Object_4 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], and Object_5 is located at positions [4, 5, 6]. The sizes of Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3 are 2x2, while the sizes of Object_4 and Object_5 are 1x1.

Based on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is that the input sequence is transformed into an output sequence by simply copying the input pixels without any modifications. However, there are some additional constraints that need to be considered:

* The number of objects in the input sequence must match the number of objects in the output sequence.
* The position of each object in the input sequence must match the position of the corresponding object in the output sequence.
* The size of each object in the input sequence must match the size of the corresponding object in the output sequence.
* The color of each pixel in the input sequence must match the color of the corresponding pixel in the output sequence.

With these constraints in mind, here's how I would transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output sequence: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, I simply copied the input pixels without making any modifications. This is because there are no objects in the input sequence, so there's nothing to transform.

Now, please provide the actual input sequence you want me to transform, and I will apply the above approach to produce the corresponding output sequence.
