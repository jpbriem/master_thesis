The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom the output, we can see that the objects in the input sequence have been transformed in the following way:\n\n* Object 1: Original size = 5, New size = 4\n* Object 2: Original size = 6, New size = 5\n\nSo, the transformation rule for this example appears to be \"scale\" (i.e., reduce the size of the object by half).\n\nExample_2:\nInput: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this case, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed in the following way:\n\n* Object 1: Original size = 5, New size = 4\n* Object 2: Original size = 5, New size = 4\n\nSo, the transformation rule for this example also appears to be \"scale\".\n\nExample_3:\nInput: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this case, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed in the following way:\n\n* Object 1: Original size = 5, New size = 4\n* Object 2: Original size = 5, New size = 4\n\nSo, the transformation rule for this example also appears to be \"scale\".\n\nNow, let's apply these transformation rules to the given test case input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]`\n\nUsing the same reasoning as before, we can identify the objects in the input sequence as follows:\n\n* Object 1: Original size = 7, New size = 6\n* Object 2: Original size = 7, New size = 6\n\nSo, the transformation rule for this example would be \"move\" (i.e., shift the objects by one position to the right).\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]`\n\nNote that the length of the output sequence is the same as the length of the input sequence.\n\nFinally, here is the requested JSON structure for the transformation:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Transform objects of size 5 to size 4\",\n\"Example_2\": \"Transform objects of size 5 to size 4\",\n\"Example_3\": \"Transform objects of size 5 to size 4\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Move objects by one position to the right\",\n\"instructions\": \"Shift the objects by one position to the right\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[copy the test case input sequence from the task]\",\n\"object_description\": \"[describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color]\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"[Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color]\",\n\"output\": \"[create the resulting test output sequence]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[return the created test output sequence in numpy array format]\"\n}"
