The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are specified in the output sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves several logical rules based on the concepts mentioned in the problem statement:\n\n* **Objects**: The input sequence contains objects, which are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color. In the output sequence, these objects are represented by non-zero pixels, where the size, position, and color of each object are specified.\n* **Noise pixels**: The input sequence may also contain noise pixels, which are represented by zero-valued pixels. These pixels do not affect the calculation of the objects' sizes, positions, or colors.\n* **Arithmetic operations**: The output sequence includes arithmetic operations based on the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the count of each object is calculated, and the results are used to sort the objects by their size.\n* **Conditional rules**: The output sequence includes conditional rules that depend on the specific input sequence. For example, if there are two or more objects in the input sequence, then they must be aligned horizontally in the output sequence.\n\nBased on these rules, we can infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences. Specifically, the output sequence can be generated by applying the following steps to the input sequence:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding consecutive pixels of the same color.\n2. Calculate the size, position, and color of each object based on its location and color relative to the other objects in the input sequence.\n3. Sort the objects in the output sequence based on their size.\n4. Apply conditional rules to ensure that the objects are properly aligned and colored in the output sequence.\n5. Replace any remaining noise pixels in the output sequence with zeros.\n\nHere's an example of how this process would work for the given input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nOutput sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, the input sequence contains three objects: the first object has size 2 and color 1, the second object has size 1 and color 1, and the third object has size 4 and color 8. The output sequence correctly reflects these objects by assigning them non-zero values while leaving the remaining pixels unchanged.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
