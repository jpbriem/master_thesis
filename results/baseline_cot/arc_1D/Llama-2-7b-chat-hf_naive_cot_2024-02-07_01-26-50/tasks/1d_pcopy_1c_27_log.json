The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also consists of 10 elements. All elements in both sequences are either 0 or 6, indicating that there are two distinct colors present in the sequence - 0 and 6. There are no noise pixels in this sequence.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also consists of 10 elements. However, in this case, there are three distinct colors present in the sequence - 0, 4, and 4. Again, there are no noise pixels in this sequence.\n* Example_3: This is the most interesting case among the three, as it has only two distinct colors - 0 and 2. Moreover, there are noise pixels present in this sequence, indicated by the presence of 0s in the sequence.\n\nNow, based on these observations, we can make an educated guess about the simplest possible relation between input and output. Let's assume that the transformation rule is simply a matter of replacing each element in the input sequence with the corresponding element in the output sequence, without any additional operations involved. In other words, the transformation rule can be represented as follows:\n\nInput \u2192 Output = Input[Output]\n\nUsing this rule, we can now transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Let's apply this rule to the test case provided:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the transformation rule, we get:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence consists of the same elements as the input sequence, but with their positions shifted according to the output sequence indices. Therefore, the transformation rule holds true for this test case.\n\nFinally, let's provide the requested outputs in JSON format:\n\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'No change', 'Example_2': 'Replace each element with the corresponding element in the output sequence', 'Example_3': 'Replace each element with the corresponding element in the output sequence, while considering noise pixels' }, 'overall_pattern': 'Replace each element in the input sequence with the corresponding element in the output sequence', 'instructions': 'Transform a new input sequence by applying the given transformation rule', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}}\n\nNote that the 'object_description' field contains the description of the objects in the input sequence, along with their sizes, positions, and colors. Similarly, the 'transformed_objects' field describes how these objects should appear in the output sequence, taking into account any necessary transformations."
