You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, rotating, and merging objects.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. **Move**: Shift the entire input sequence by 1 pixel to the right.
2. **Scale**: Multiply each pixel value in the input sequence by a factor of 2.
3. **Rotate**: Rotate the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise.
4. **Merge**: Merge the two smallest objects in the input sequence into a single object.
5. **Remove**: Remove the largest object in the input sequence.
6. **Recolor**: Replace each pixel value in the input sequence with the average color of the surrounding pixels (i.e., the pixels within a 3x3 neighborhood).
7. **Copy**: Copy the remaining objects in the input sequence unchanged to their corresponding positions in the output sequence.

Here's the detailed explanation for each step:

1. **Move**: The reason for shifting the input sequence by 1 pixel to the right is to maintain the spatial relationships between adjacent pixels. By doing so, we ensure that the objects in the input sequence remain aligned properly in the output sequence.
2. **Scale**: Scaling each pixel value by a factor of 2 helps to balance out the differences in size between the objects in the input sequence. This operation also helps to reduce the overall contrast between the objects and the background.
3. **Rotate**: Rotating the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise helps to improve the overall symmetry of the output sequence. By doing so, we ensure that the objects in the output sequence are more evenly distributed and better aligned with each other.
4. **Merge**: Merging the two smallest objects in the input sequence into a single object helps to reduce the number of objects in the output sequence while preserving the overall structure of the input sequence. By doing so, we simplify the output sequence and make it easier to interpret.
5. **Remove**: Removing the largest object in the input sequence helps to simplify the output sequence further by removing unnecessary complexity. By doing so, we improve the overall readability of the output sequence.
6. **Recolor**: Recoloring each pixel value in the input sequence with the average color of the surrounding pixels helps to create a more cohesive and harmonious color scheme in the output sequence. By doing so, we enhance the visual appeal of the output sequence.
7. **Copy**: Copying the remaining objects in the input sequence unchanged to their corresponding positions in the output sequence ensures that the important features of the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence. By doing so, we maintain the essential details of the input sequence while simplifying it at the same time.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is to progressively refine and simplify the input sequence through a series of operations that preserve the essential features of the original sequence while reducing its complexity. By applying these operations in a systematic manner, we can transform the input sequence into an output sequence that is more visually appealing and easier to interpret.

**Transformation**

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Copy the input sequence as is.
2. Move the input sequence by 1 pixel to the right.
3. Scale each pixel value in the input sequence by a factor of 2.
4. Rotate the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise.
5. Merge the two smallest objects in the input sequence into a single object.
6. Remove the largest object in the input sequence.
7. Recolor each pixel value in the input sequence with the average color of the surrounding pixels.
8. Copy the remaining objects in the input sequence unchanged to their corresponding positions in the output sequence.

By following these steps, we can successfully transform the input sequence into the output sequence.
