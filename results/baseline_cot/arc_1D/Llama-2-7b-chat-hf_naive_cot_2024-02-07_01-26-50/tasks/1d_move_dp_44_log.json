The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem! Here's my answer:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel value ranging from 1 to 9 (representing different colors) and 0 (representing the background color). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include their starting index, ending index, and size.\n\nBased on the given examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and recoloring the objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels present in the input sequence that need to be handled.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we will need to apply these operations in a systematic way, taking into account the properties of the objects in the input sequence. We will also need to handle conditions and arithmetics based on the objects.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation seems to involve manipulating the objects in the input sequence according to their properties, while also handling noise pixels and conditions. The exact nature of these operations is not specified in the problem statement, but based on the examples provided, it seems likely that they will involve some combination of moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and recoloring the objects.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding consecutive pixels of the same color.\n2. Determine the properties of each object, including its starting index, ending index, and size.\n3. Apply the necessary transformations to each object based on its properties, using the operations mentioned earlier (e.g., moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, recoloring).\n4. Handle any noise pixels in the input sequence by either ignoring them or applying a suitable operation to them.\n5. Sort the output sequence according to the conditions specified in the problem statement.\n6. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo perform the transformation, we will need to copy the test case input sequence and modify it according to the instructions above. Specifically, we will need to:\n\n* Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\n* Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding consecutive pixels of the same color.\n* Determine the properties of each object, including its starting index, ending index, and size.\n* Apply the necessary transformations to each object based on its properties, using the operations mentioned earlier (e.g., moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, recoloring).\n* Handle any noise pixels in the input sequence by either ignoring them or applying a suitable operation to them.\n* Sort the output sequence according to the conditions specified in the problem statement.\n* Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nThe test output sequence will be the resulting sequence after applying the transformation to the test case input sequence. Its length will depend on the specific input sequence used for testing."
