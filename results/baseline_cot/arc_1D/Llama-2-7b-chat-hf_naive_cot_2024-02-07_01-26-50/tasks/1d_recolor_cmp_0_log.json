The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nOutput: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2]\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero elements) and noise pixels (represented by zero elements). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some differences in their positions and sizes. Specifically, the objects in the output sequence are shifted towards the right compared to the input sequence, and their sizes are reduced by half.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nSimilar to the previous example, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, while the output sequence has some differences in the positions and sizes of the objects. However, in this example, the objects in the output sequence are rotated clockwise by 90 degrees compared to the input sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, similar to the previous two examples. However, the output sequence has some differences in the positions and sizes of the objects, and there are some additional noise pixels at the beginning and end of the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can make the following transformations:\n\n* Shift the objects towards the right by one position.\n* Reduce the size of each object by half.\n* Add an extra noise pixel at the beginning and end of the output sequence.\n\nApplying these transformations, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2]\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for this problem is:\n\nTransformation Rule: Given an input sequence consisting of alternating objects and noise pixels, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Shift each object towards the right by one position.\n2. Reduce the size of each object by half.\n3. Add an extra noise pixel at the beginning and end of the output sequence.\n\nI hope this helps you solve the problem! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
