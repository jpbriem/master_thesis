The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 11 elements, and the output sequence also has 11 elements. All elements in the input sequence are either 0 or 2, except for one element that is 9. Similarly, all elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 2, except for one element that is 0. It seems that there is no transformation happening here, just copying the input sequence directly to the output sequence.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of 11 elements, and the output sequence also has 11 elements. However, in this case, some elements in the input sequence have been transformed. For instance, the third element in the input sequence is 3, but in the output sequence, it is still 0. Similarly, the fifth element in the input sequence is 5, but in the output sequence, it is still 0. It seems that the transformation rule is simply replacing any non-zero element with 0.\n* Example_3: This is similar to Example_2, where some elements in the input sequence have been transformed. In this case, all elements in the input sequence are either 0 or 8, except for one element that is 4. Similarly, all elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 8, except for one element that is 0. Again, it seems that the transformation rule is simply replacing any non-zero element with 0.\n\nNow, let me apply these insights to the test case provided:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the analysis above, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is simply copying the input sequence directly to the output sequence without any transformation. Therefore, my transformation steps would be:\n\n1. Copy the test case input sequence [0, 0,..., 0, 1,..., 1, 5,..., 3,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1, 0,..., 0,..., 0,..., 0,..., 0]\n2. Create the resulting test output sequence [0, 0,..., 0, 1,..., 1, 5,..., 3,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1,..., 1, 0,..., 0,..., 0,..., 0,..., 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence is simply the original input sequence copied verbatim.\n\nFinally, here is the JSON response for the test case:\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"No transformation happened in the input-output pair.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"Some elements in the input sequence were transformed to 0.\",\n\"Example_3\": \"All elements in the input sequence were transformed to 0.\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Copy the input sequence directly to the output sequence without any transformation.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
