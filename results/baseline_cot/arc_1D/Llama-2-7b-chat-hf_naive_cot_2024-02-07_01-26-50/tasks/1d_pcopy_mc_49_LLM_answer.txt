You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are specified in the output sequence.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding consecutive pixels of the same color.
2. Determine the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence.
3. Scale each object by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.
4. Shift each object horizontally by one pixel to the right.
5. Remove any noise pixels (i.e., pixels with a value of 0).
6. Sort the remaining pixels in ascending order based on their color.

Here's an example of how these steps would be applied to the given input sequence:

Input sequence: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects:

Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}
Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 2}

Step 2: Determine the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence. Based on the above objects, we have:

Object 1: size = 3, position = [1, 2, 3], color = 7
Object 2: size = 2, position = [5, 6], color = 7

Step 3: Scale each object by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions. This means that the size of each object will double in both dimensions:

Object 1: size = 6, position = [1, 2, 3], color = 7
Object 2: size = 4, position = [5, 6], color = 7

Step 4: Shift each object horizontally by one pixel to the right. This means that the position of each object will shift to the right by one pixel:

Object 1: position = [1, 3, 3], color = 7
Object 2: position = [5, 7], color = 7

Step 5: Remove any noise pixels (i.e., pixels with a value of 0). Since there are no noise pixels in the input sequence, this step is skipped:

Step 6: Sort the remaining pixels in ascending order based on their color. Since the input sequence contains only two objects, it is already sorted based on color:

Output sequence: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]`

Therefore, the transformation from the input sequence to the output sequence involves identifying objects in the input sequence, determining their size, position, and color, scaling them by a factor of 2, shifting them horizontally by one pixel, and removing any noise pixels. Finally, the remaining pixels are sorted in ascending order based on their color to produce the output sequence.
