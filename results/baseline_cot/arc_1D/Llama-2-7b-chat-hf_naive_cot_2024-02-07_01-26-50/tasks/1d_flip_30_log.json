            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here are some observations and hypotheses about the transformation process:\n\n* Pixels with the same color as the background (i.e., 0) remain unchanged in both the input and output sequences.\n* Pixels with a color different from the background are either moved, resized, or recolored based on their relative positions and distances from other colored pixels.\n* The distance metric used to determine the similarity between pixels may be Euclidean or Manhattan distance, as the transformation patterns do not seem to involve any complex geometric operations.\n* The color of a pixel can be modified based on the presence of other colored pixels nearby. For instance, if there is a red pixel next to a green pixel, the green pixel may turn blue.\n\nWith these assumptions in mind, here is a step-by-step transformation process for converting an input sequence of pixels into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence, applying the following transformation rules:\n\nRule 1: If the current pixel has the same color as the background (i.e., 0), skip this rule and proceed to the next pixel.\n\nRule 2: If the current pixel has a color different from the background, apply the following modifications:\n\n* Move the current pixel horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (not shown in the examples) based on its distance from other colored pixels.\n* Resize the current pixel by scaling its width or height by a factor (not shown in the examples) based on its distance from other colored pixels.\n* Recolor the current pixel to a random color chosen from the set of colors different from the current pixel's color (not shown in the examples).\n\nStep 3: Add the transformed pixel to the output sequence at its new position.\n\nRepeat Steps 2 and 3 until all pixels in the input sequence have been processed.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the transformation process in Python using NumPy:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input):\n    # Initialize output sequence\n    output = np.zeros((len(input),))\n    \n    # Apply transformation rules to each pixel\n    for i in range(len(input)):\n        if input[i] == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Move pixel horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount\n        dx = np.random.uniform(-1, 1) * 5\n        dy = np.random.uniform(-1, 1) * 5\n        \n        # Resize pixel by scaling its width or height by a factor\n        factor = np.min([np.abs(dx), np.abs(dy)])\n        output[i] = input[i] * factor\n        \n        # Recolor pixel to a random color chosen from the set of colors different from the current pixel's color\n        color = np.random.choice(range(len(input)), p=[1 - np.abs(dx), 1 - np.abs(dy)])\n        output[i] = color\n    \n    return output\n```\nNow, please provide the actual input sequence you would like me to transform, and I will run the transformation process and output the resulting output sequence."
