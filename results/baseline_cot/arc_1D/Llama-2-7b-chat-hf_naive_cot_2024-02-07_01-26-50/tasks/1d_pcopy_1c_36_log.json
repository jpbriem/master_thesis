The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and removing objects. The output sequence is obtained by applying these operations in a specific way.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence by a fixed amount (either horizontally or vertically).\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor (either horizontally or vertically).\n3. Remove some of the objects in the input sequence based on their color and position.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 multiple times.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence.\n2. Apply the transformation pattern to the copied input sequence by moving, scaling, and removing objects.\n3. Repeat step 2 until no more changes occur.\n4. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere are the detailed instructions for each step of the transformation process:\n\n1. **Input:** Copy the given input sequence.\n2. **Object Description:** In the input sequence, there are several objects defined by their color, size, and position. Describe each object in terms of its size, position, and color. For example, the first object is a block of color 2 located at position 1, size 2x2.\n3. **Transformed Objects:** Based on the description of the objects in step 2, transform each object in the input sequence according to the transformation pattern. For example, if an object is moved by a fixed amount, increase its position by that amount. If an object is scaled by a factor, multiply its value by that factor. If an object is removed, set its value to 0.\n4. **Output:** Create a new output sequence by concatenating the transformed objects in the correct order.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nUsing the given input sequence, here is the resulting test output sequence:\n```json\n[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence and contains only the objects that were present in the input sequence after applying the transformation pattern."
