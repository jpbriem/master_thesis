The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some changes in their sizes and positions. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been scaled up by a factor of 2 and shifted towards the right by one position in the output sequence. Additionally, some noise pixels in the input sequence have been removed, while others have been added at the beginning and end of the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of a single object (represented by a repeating pattern of values starting from 0) surrounded by noise pixels. The output sequence also consists of a single object, but with some changes in its size and position. Specifically, the object in the output sequence is larger than the object in the input sequence and is centered at a different position. Additionally, some noise pixels have been removed from the output sequence, while others have been added around the object.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of multiple objects (represented by repeating patterns of values starting from 0) separated by noise pixels. The output sequence also consists of multiple objects, but with some changes in their sizes and positions. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been shrunk by a factor of 2 and shifted towards the left by one position in the output sequence. Additionally, some noise pixels have been removed from the output sequence, while others have been added around the objects.\n\nBased on these examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves scaling, shifting, and removing/adding noise pixels. Moreover, the objects in the input sequence seem to be related to each other through some kind of alignment or overlapping mechanism.\n\nNow, let me apply these insights to transform a new input sequence. Suppose we have an input sequence of length 10 consisting of the following values:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I would follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are no objects, as all the values are zero.\n\nStep 2: Determine the noise pixels in the input sequence. In this case, all the values are zero, so there are no noise pixels.\n\nStep 3: Scale the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. This means that each value in the input sequence will be multiplied by 2 before being used to generate the output sequence.\n\nStep 4: Shift the input sequence towards the right by one position. This means that each value in the input sequence will be moved one position to the right before being used to generate the output sequence.\n\nStep 5: Remove the first and last noise pixels from the input sequence. Since the input sequence contains no noise pixels, this step is unnecessary.\n\nStep 6: Generate the output sequence by applying the above transformations to the scaled and shifted input sequence.\n\nThe resulting output sequence would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence consists of the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with some changes in their values due to the scaling and shifting operations applied earlier.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for this specific problem is:\n\nTransform(x) = 2*x + x%10\n\nWhere x is the input sequence, and the % operator performs the modulo operation to wrap around the range of values (i.e., 0, 1, 2,..., 9)."
