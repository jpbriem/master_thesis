The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 8, representing the background color or an object, respectively. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 8, indicating that no change has been made to the input sequence.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9, representing the background color or an object, respectively. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9, indicating that no change has been made to the input sequence.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 9 elements, where each element is either 0 or 7, representing the background color or an object, respectively. The output sequence consists of 9 elements, where each element is either 0 or 7, indicating that some changes have been made to the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input sequence without making any changes to it. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one mapping, where each input element is mapped to the corresponding output element without any modification.\n\nNow, let's consider how to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions:\n\n1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n2. Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n\nObjects in the input sequence:\n\nObject_1: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject_2: {color: 5, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n\n3. Transform the objects in the input sequence according to the given transformation actions.\n\nFor Object_1, we need to move it two positions to the right (start_index = 1, end_index = 3) and increase its size by 2. So, the transformed object looks like this: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 4}.\n\nFor Object_2, we need to remove it completely since it has a size of 1.\n\n4. Describe how the transformed objects should look like in the output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n\nTransformed objects in the output sequence:\n\nObject_1: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 4}\n\n5. Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n6. Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\n\nTest output sequence: np.array([0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])"
