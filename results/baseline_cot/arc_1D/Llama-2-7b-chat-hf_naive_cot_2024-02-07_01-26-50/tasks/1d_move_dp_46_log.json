The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn each input sequence, there are several groups of pixels that have the same color. These groups can be considered as objects. In the given input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], the objects are:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 5}\n* Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 2}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nBased on the given transformation pattern, we need to apply the following transformations to each object:\n\n* Move the objects one position to the right (i.e., shift them by one pixel).\n* If an object overlaps with another object, remove the smaller object.\n* Scale the remaining object by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n\nUsing these transformations, we can update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence.\n\nStep 3: Update the output sequence\n\nAfter applying the transformations to the objects, we need to update the output sequence accordingly. The updated output sequence will have the same number of pixels as the input sequence, but with the transformed objects.\n\nFor the given input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], the updated output sequence would be:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the objects in the output sequence have been transformed according to the given transformation pattern.\n\nOverall pattern:\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation appears to be moving the objects one position to the right, removing any overlapping objects, scaling the remaining objects by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions, and updating the output sequence accordingly.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Apply the transformations to each object, shifting it one position to the right, removing any overlapping objects, scaling the remaining object by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n3. Update the output sequence accordingly.\n\nTransformation:\n\nInput: Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\nObject description: Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\nTransformed objects: Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\nOutput: Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\nTest output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
