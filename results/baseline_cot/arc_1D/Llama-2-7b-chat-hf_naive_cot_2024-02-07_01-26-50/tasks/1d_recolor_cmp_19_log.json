The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of consecutive pixels of the same color. The objects are connected horizontally, and their positions are determined by their starting index. The noise pixels are represented by random values between 1 and 9.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a simple pattern:\n\n* Move any object one position to the right if there is an object to the left.\n* Remove any object that has moved off the right edge of the sequence.\n* If there are no more objects after removing the last one, add a new object at the left edge of the sequence with a random value between 1 and 9.\n\nBased on these rules, we can write down the following instructions for transforming a new input sequence:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the rules above to each object.\n3. For each object that moves to the right, increment the corresponding pixel value in the output sequence by 1.\n4. For each object that is removed, set the corresponding pixel value in the output sequence to 0.\n5. For each new object added, set its pixel value in the output sequence to a random value between 1 and 9.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until all objects have been processed.\n\nNow, let me provide the detailed transformation for the given test case:\n\n**Input**\n\n[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\n**Transformed Output**\n\n[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Object 1 (size = 7): Moves one position to the right due to having an object to the left. Its pixel value in the output sequence is increased by 1 to 4.\n2. Object 2 (size = 7): Removed since it has moved off the right edge of the sequence.\n3. New object (size = 7): Added at the left edge of the sequence with a random value of 7.\n4. Object 3 (size = 7): Moves one position to the right due to having an object to the left. Its pixel value in the output sequence is increased by 1 to 4.\n5. Object 4 (size = 7): Removed since it has moved off the right edge of the sequence.\n6. New object (size = 7): Added at the left edge of the sequence with a random value of 7.\n7. Object 5 (size = 7): Moves one position to the right due to having an object to the left. Its pixel value in the output sequence is increased by 1 to 4.\n8. Object 6 (size = 7): Removed since it has moved off the right edge of the sequence.\n9. New object (size = 7): Added at the left edge of the sequence with a random value of 7.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence has the same objects as the input sequence, but with updated pixel values reflecting their movements and removals."
