You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are important factors in the transformation process. The noise pixels are ignored during the transformation.

The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, and aligning objects. These operations are governed by logical rules that involve conditions and relations between objects.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply these operations in a specific order, taking into account the size, position, and color of each object. The final output sequence will consist of the transformed objects, along with any additional noise pixels that may have been introduced during the transformation process.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence, applying the appropriate operation based on the current pixel's color and the positions and sizes of nearby objects.
3. Update the corresponding pixel in the output sequence with the result of the operation.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire input sequence has been processed.
5. Return the resulting output sequence.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Copy the test input sequence from the task.
2. Apply the necessary transformations to each pixel in the input sequence, using the logical rules provided earlier.
3. Update the corresponding pixel in the output sequence with the result of the transformation.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire input sequence has been processed.
5. Return the resulting output sequence.

**Transformation**

Here are the detailed instructions for each transformation operation:

1. Move: If the current pixel is part of an object, move it to the right position based on its size and the positions of nearby objects. Otherwise, leave the pixel unchanged.
2. Hollow: If the current pixel is part of an object, remove it from the object and place it at the beginning of the output sequence. Otherwise, leave the pixel unchanged.
3. Scale: If the current pixel is part of an object, resize it based on its size and the positions of nearby objects. Otherwise, leave the pixel unchanged.
4. Copy: If the current pixel is part of an object, copy it to the beginning of the output sequence. Otherwise, leave the pixel unchanged.
5. Recolor: If the current pixel is part of an object, change its color based on the colors of nearby objects. Otherwise, leave the pixel unchanged.
6. Align: If the current pixel is part of an object, align it with the nearest object based on their positions and sizes. Otherwise, leave the pixel unchanged.

**Test Output**

Using the given input sequence, here is the resulting test output sequence:
```json
[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Note that the output sequence consists of the same number of pixels as the input sequence, but with the colors and positions of the objects transformed according to the logical rules provided earlier.
