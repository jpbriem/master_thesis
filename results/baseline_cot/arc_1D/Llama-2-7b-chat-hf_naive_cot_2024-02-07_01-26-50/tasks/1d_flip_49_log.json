The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 2) arranged in a row. The output sequence also consists of 10 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 6) arranged in a row. The only difference between the two sequences is the color of the non-zero pixels, which changes from color 2 to color 6.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 7 non-zeros (colors 0, 7, and 7 repeated 7 times) arranged in a row. The output sequence also consists of 10 zeros and 7 non-zeros (colors 0, 7, and 7 repeated 7 times) arranged in a row. The only difference between the two sequences is the repetition of the non-zero colors, which remains the same but with a different number of repeats.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 8 non-zeros (colors 0, 7, and 7 repeated 8 times) arranged in a row. The output sequence consists of 10 zeros and 8 non-zeros (colors 0, 7, and 7 repeated 8 times) arranged in a row, with one additional non-zero pixel at the beginning of the sequence (color 8).\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves changing the color of the non-zero pixels in the input sequence to a different color in the output sequence. Specifically, the color of each non-zero pixel in the input sequence is replaced by a random color chosen from the set {0, 7, 7, 8} in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the above transformation pattern, we can transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has the same structure as the input sequence, but with the colors of the non-zero pixels changed according to the transformation pattern. In particular, the color of each non-zero pixel in the input sequence is replaced by a random color chosen from the set {0, 7, 7, 8} in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for this problem is simply:\n\nTransformation Rule: Replace each non-zero pixel in the input sequence with a random color chosen from the set {0, 7, 7, 8} in the output sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
