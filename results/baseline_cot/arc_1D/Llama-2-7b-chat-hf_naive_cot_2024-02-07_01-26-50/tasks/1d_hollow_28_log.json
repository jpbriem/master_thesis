The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom the output, we can see that the objects in the input sequence have been moved to the right by one position. Specifically, the object at index 1 in the input has been moved to index 2 in the output, and so on.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this case, the objects in the input sequence have been resized by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions. Specifically, the object at index 1 in the input has been stretched to twice its original size and placed at index 2 in the output, while the object at index 2 in the input has been stretched to twice its original size and placed at index 3 in the output, and so on.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this case, the objects in the input sequence have been rotated by 90 degrees clockwise. Specifically, the object at index 1 in the input has been rotated to the position of the object at index 2 in the output, and so on.\n\nNow, let's consider the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can make the following predictions about the output sequence:\n\n* The objects in the input sequence will be moved to the right by one position.\n* The objects will be resized by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\n* The objects will be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output sequence for the given input sequence is:\n\nOutput: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nNote that this prediction is based solely on the patterns observed in the given input-output pairs, and does not take into account any additional constraints or rules that may apply to the problem."
