The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, all of which are either 0 or 8. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, all of which are either 0 or 8. It seems that there is no transformation happening here - the input and output sequences are simply mirrored versions of each other.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of 10 elements, all of which are either 0 or 8. However, the output sequence has only 5 elements, all of which are either 0 or 2. This suggests that some elements in the input sequence are being removed or transformed into 0.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, all of which are either 0 or 8. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, but with a different distribution of values. Some elements in the input sequence are transformed into 0, while others are transformed into 8.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple mirroring operation (i.e., flipping the input sequence horizontally). However, there may be additional transformations happening depending on the specific input sequence provided.\n\nNow, let's consider a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can apply the simple mirroring operation observed in Examples 1 and 2. The output sequence would be:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence is simply a mirrored version of the input sequence. Note that since the input sequence contains multiple occurrences of the value 3, some of these occurrences are transformed into 0 in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for this problem is:\n\nTransformation Rule: If an element in the input sequence is equal to 3, then it is transformed into 0 in the output sequence. Otherwise, the element remains unchanged.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
