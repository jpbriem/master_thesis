The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9. The only difference between the input and output sequences is that some of the elements in the output sequence are 0, while they were 9 in the input sequence.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9. However, there is a change in the positions of some of the elements in the output sequence compared to the input sequence.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9. The output sequence consists of 8 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9. There is no difference between the input and output sequences.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves changing the values of some elements in the input sequence to 0 in the output sequence. Additionally, the positions of some elements in the output sequence may differ from their positions in the input sequence.\n\nNow, let's consider a new input sequence [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects: {color: 7, start_index: 2, end_index: 5, size: 5} and {color: 9, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 3}.\n\nStep 2: Apply the necessary transformations to the objects in the input sequence. Since the input sequence consists of 8 elements, we need to perform 8 transformations. For the first object, we need to move it 5 positions to the right (start_index = 2, end_index = 7). For the second object, we need to move it 3 positions to the left (start_index = 6, end_index = 3).\n\nStep 3: Check if any noise pixels exist in the input sequence. Since there are no noise pixels in the input sequence, we can skip this step.\n\nStep 4: Perform arithmetics based on the objects in the input sequence. We don't need to perform any arithmetics since there are no objects in the input sequence.\n\nStep 5: Check if any conditions exist in the input sequence. Since there are no conditions in the input sequence, we can skip this step.\n\nStep 6: Transform the input sequence into its output sequence. Based on the observed transformation pattern, we need to set all elements in the output sequence to 0 except for the last element, which should be 9. Therefore, the transformed output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9].\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for the given input sequence is:\n\nTransform(input) = {move(Object_1, 5), move(Object_2, -3)} -> {output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
