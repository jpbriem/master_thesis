The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example 1: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 2) arranged in a row. The output sequence also consists of 10 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 8), but with the non-zeros shifted one position to the right compared to the input.\n* Example 2: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 6 non-zeros (colors 7 and 6) arranged in a column. The output sequence consists of 10 zeros and 6 non-zeros (colors 7 and 6), but with some of the non-zeros swapped relative to each other.\n* Example 3: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 3 non-zeros (color 6) arranged in a row. The output sequence consists of 10 zeros and 3 non-zeros (color 0), but with the non-zeros shifted two positions to the left compared to the input.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves shifting or moving the non-zeros in the input sequence to corresponding positions in the output sequence. Additionally, there may be some rotation or rearrangement of the non-zeros in the output sequence compared to the input.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to transform a new input sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:\n```markdown\ninput = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can simply shift the non-zeros in the input sequence to corresponding positions in the output sequence, while maintaining their original colors. Here's the resulting output sequence:\n```markdown\noutput = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAs expected, the output sequence consists of 10 zeros and 0 non-zeros, just like the input sequence.\n\nTherefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple shift operation that moves the non-zeros in the input sequence to corresponding positions in the output sequence. This transformation rule can be applied to any input sequence to produce its corresponding output sequence."
