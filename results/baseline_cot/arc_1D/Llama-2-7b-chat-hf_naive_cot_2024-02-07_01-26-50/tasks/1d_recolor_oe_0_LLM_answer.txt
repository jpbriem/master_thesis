You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the objects seem to be moved, resized, and aligned with each other. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects: Object 1 (size = 2) and Object 2 (size = 2).

Step 2: Move Object 1 one position to the right. This means that the starting index of Object 1 becomes the ending index of Object 2, and vice versa. So, the updated positions of the objects in the input sequence would be:

Object 1: [2, 3, 3, 2, 0]
Object 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]

Step 3: Resize Object 1 to twice its original size. This means that the width and height of Object 1 become doubled. So, the updated dimensions of Object 1 would be:

Width: 4
Height: 4

Step 4: Align Object 1 with Object 2. This means that the top left corner of Object 1 is aligned with the top left corner of Object 2. So, the updated positions of the objects in the input sequence would be:

Object 1: [2, 3, 3, 2, 0]
Object 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]

Step 5: Remove Object 2 from the input sequence. Since Object 2 has been moved one position to the right, its starting index becomes the ending index of Object 1. So, the updated input sequence without Object 2 would be:

Object 1: [2, 3, 3, 2, 0]

Step 6: Add a noise pixel at the last position of the input sequence. This noise pixel can be any random value between 0 and 1. Let's choose a value of 0.5 for this example. So, the final input sequence without Object 2 would be:

Object 1: [2, 3, 3, 2, 0]
Noise pixel: 0.5

Now, let's apply the same transformation steps to the output sequence to get the transformed output sequence:

Step 7: Move the noise pixel one position to the left. This means that the noise pixel becomes the starting index of Object 1 in the output sequence. So, the updated positions of the objects in the output sequence would be:

Object 1: [2, 3, 3, 2, 0]
Noise pixel: 0

Step 8: Resize Object 1 to its original size. So, the width and height of Object 1 become their original values.

Step 9: Align Object 1 with Object 2 in the output sequence. This means that the top left corner of Object 1 is aligned with the top left corner of Object 2 in the output sequence.

And that's it! By applying these transformation steps to the input sequence, we get the transformed output sequence.

Here's the final output sequence in JSON format:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. The input sequence contains two objects: Object 1 (size = 2) and Object 2 (size = 2). The output sequence contains three objects: Object 1 (size = 4), Object 2 (size = 2), and a noise pixel (value = 0.5). The objects are aligned with each other, and Object 1 has been moved one position to the right.",
    "Example_2": "..."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Move an object one position to the right, resize it to twice its original size, align it with another object, and then remove the second object. Add a noise pixel at the end of the sequence.",
  "instructions": "Transform a new input sequence by applying the same transformation steps. Think step by step.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
    "object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color. Object 1 has a size of 2, is located at position [2, 3], and has a color of 2. Object 2 has a size of 2, is located at position [0, 1], and has a color of 2.",
    "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color. Object 1 has a size of 4, is located at position [2, 3], and has a color of 2. Object 2 has a size of 2, is located at position [0, 1], and has a color of 2.",
    "output": "[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
  },
  "test_output": "[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}
```
