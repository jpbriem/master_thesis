The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves applying a series of logical rules to the input sequence, which are as follows:\n\n1. Move any object that is touching another object to the right by one index.\n2. If an object overlaps with another object, remove the smaller object.\n3. Scale any object by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n4. Remove any object that has a size of 1.\n5. Copy any object and shift it to the left by one index.\n6. Recolor any object that has a color of 0 to the color of the next object to its right.\n7. Sort the remaining objects by their x-position.\n\nBased on these rules, the output sequence is generated by applying the above transformation to the input sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to rearrange the objects in the input sequence according to their positions and sizes, while also changing their colors and shapes through various operations. The output sequence reflects the final arrangement of objects after applying all the transformation rules.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the output sequence with the given input sequence.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the logic rules provided earlier.\n3. Apply the transformation rules to the identified objects in the input sequence, starting with rule 1 and proceeding to rule 7.\n4. Update the output sequence accordingly after applying each rule.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire input sequence has been processed.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how to perform the transformation for the given test input sequence:\n\n1. Input: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]`\n2. Identify objects in the input sequence: Object 1: {color: 9, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}; Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 2}\n3. Apply transformation rules:\n\t* Rule 1: Move Object 1 to the right by one index (since it is touching Object 2). Output: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]`\n\t* Rule 2: Object 2 overlaps with Object 1, so remove Object 2. Output: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]`\n\t* Rule 3: Scale Object 1 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions. Output: `[0, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 18, 18, 0, 0, 9, 18, 18, 18, 0, 0]`\n\t* Rule 4: Remove Object 1 since it has a size of 1. Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\t* Rule 5: Copy Object 1 and shift it to the left by one index. Output: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]`\n\t* Rule 6: Recolor Object 2 to the color of the next object to its right (which is 9). Output: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]`\n\t* Rule 7: Sort the remaining objects by their x-position. Output: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]`\n4. The output sequence is the resulting array after applying all the transformation rules.\n\nTherefore, the transformation from the input sequence `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]` to its output sequence `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]` is achieved by applying the given transformation rules."
