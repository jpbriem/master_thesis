The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 7) at the 5th index. The output sequence also consists of 10 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 7) at the 5th index. There is no object recognition or manipulation in this example.\n* Example_2: In this example, there are two objects (colors 4 and 8) recognized in the input sequence, and their positions are aligned correctly in the output sequence. The objects are moved horizontally by one position in the output sequence.\n* Example_3: This example involves recognizing and manipulating objects in the input sequence. Two objects (colors 2 and 8) are recognized, and they are moved vertically by one position in the output sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves recognizing and manipulating objects in the input sequence, and aligning them correctly in the output sequence. The exact nature of the transformation depends on the specific input and output sequences provided.\n\nNow, let's apply the above observation to the test input sequence provided:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can infer that the transformation pattern involves recognizing and manipulating objects in the input sequence, and aligning them correctly in the output sequence. Therefore, the transformation rule for this input sequence could be:\n\nObject recognition and manipulation:\n\n* Recognize objects in the input sequence based on their colors (e.g., color 2).\n* Manipulate the objects by moving them vertically by one position in the output sequence.\n\nAlignment:\n\n* Align the objects in the output sequence based on their colors.\n\nUsing these transformation rules, we can now transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence as follows:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nIn this output sequence, the objects recognized in the input sequence are aligned correctly based on their colors. The object at index 5 in the input sequence is moved vertically by one position to index 6 in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for the test input sequence is:\n\nTransform(input): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
