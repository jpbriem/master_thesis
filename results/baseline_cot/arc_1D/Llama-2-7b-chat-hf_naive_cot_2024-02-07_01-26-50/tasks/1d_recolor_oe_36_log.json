The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are combined and resized according to some rule. Specifically, each object is doubled in size and shifted one position to the right. Additionally, there seems to be a rule that if an object has a neighboring object with the same color, they will merge into a single larger object.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, it appears that the objects in the input sequence are simply copied and pasted without any modification.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that the transformation pattern involves combining and resizing objects, merging objects with adjacent objects of the same color, and copying objects without modification.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nBased on the observed patterns, we can propose the following transformation steps:\n\n1. Combine the first two objects (both with color 0) into a single object with color 0.\n2. Resize the third object (with color 4) to twice its original size and shift it one position to the right.\n3. Merge the fourth object (also with color 4) with the previous object (now with color 8).\n4. Copy the fifth object (still with color 4) without modifying it.\n5. Resize the sixth object (again with color 4) to three times its original size and shift it two positions to the right.\n6. Merge the seventh object (with color 4) with the previous object (now with color 16).\n7. Copy the eighth object (still with color 4) without modifying it.\n8. Resize the ninth object (again with color 4) to four times its original size and shift it three positions to the right.\n\nApplying these steps to the input sequence yields the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this specific input sequence is:\n\nOverall pattern: Combine and resize objects, merge objects with adjacent objects of the same color, copy objects without modification.\n\nInstructions: Given a new input sequence, follow the above transformation pattern to obtain the corresponding output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\n* Input: Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n* Object description: Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n* Transformed objects: Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n* Output: Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\nI hope this helps you complete the task! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
