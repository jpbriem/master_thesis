The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of 10 pixels, and the output sequence also has 10 pixels. Each pixel value in the input sequence corresponds to a specific color (ranging from 0 to 9), while each pixel value in the output sequence corresponds to the same color. Moreover, there are no gaps or overlaps between adjacent pixels in both sequences.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one mapping between each pixel value in the input sequence and its corresponding pixel value in the output sequence. In other words, without any additional transformations or operations, we can simply copy each pixel value from the input sequence to its corresponding position in the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nSimilar to Example 1, the input sequence consists of 8 pixels, and the output sequence also has 8 pixels. Again, each pixel value in the input sequence corresponds to a specific color, and there are no gaps or overlaps between adjacent pixels in both sequences.\n\nTherefore, based on these two examples, it appears that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple copying operation, where each pixel value in the input sequence is copied to its corresponding position in the output sequence without any modifications.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: `['0', '9', '9', '9', '0', '0', '4', '0', '0', '0', '6', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']`\n\nUsing the above observation, we can transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:\n\nOutput: `['0', '9', '9', '9', '0', '0', '4', '4', '4', '0', '6', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']`\n\nAs expected, the output sequence consists of the same number of pixels as the input sequence, and each pixel value in the output sequence corresponds to the same color as its counterpart in the input sequence.\n\nTherefore, based on the given input-output pairs and the provided instructions, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one copying operation, where each pixel value in the input sequence is copied to its corresponding position in the output sequence without any modifications."
