You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Move object 1 to position 2.

In the input sequence, object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of object 1 is less than the starting index of object 2 (which is 4), we need to move object 1 to position 2. This means that the value at index 2 in the input sequence becomes part of object 1, and the value at index 3 becomes part of the background color.

Step 2: Scale object 2 horizontally by a factor of 2.

In the input sequence, object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. To scale object 2 horizontally by a factor of 2, we multiply each value in object 2 by 2. This means that the width of object 2 increases by a factor of 2, while the height remains unchanged.

Step 3: Remove object 3.

In the input sequence, there is one noise pixel at index 7. Since object 3 is defined as having a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8, we can safely remove the noise pixel at index 7 without affecting any other object.

Step 4: Recolor object 1 to have a color of 7.

In the input sequence, object 1 has a color of 2. To recolor object 1 to have a color of 7, we simply replace each value in object 1 with the corresponding value in the output sequence, which has a color of 7.

Step 5: Sort the remaining objects by their starting indices.

Since there are three remaining objects in the input sequence after steps 1-4, we need to sort them by their starting indices. The sorted order is:

* Object 1: starting index = 1, ending index = 4
* Object 2: starting index = 4, ending index = 4
* Object 3: starting index = 8, ending index = 8

Step 6: Apply the above sorting to the output sequence.

After sorting the remaining objects in the input sequence, we apply the same sorting to the output sequence. The resulting output sequence is:

[0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]

Therefore, the transformed output sequence is:

['Example_1': '[0, 0, 5, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]', 'Example_2': '[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]', 'Example_3': '[0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]]

Note that the transformation pattern is the same for all input-output pairs provided, so the above steps can be applied to any input sequence to obtain the corresponding output sequence.
