You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Additionally, there are noise pixels that need to be handled.

To begin with, let's analyze the input sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. There are three objects in the input sequence:

* Object 1: [1, 2, 3], size = 3, position = [1, 2, 3]
* Object 2: [4, 5, 6], size = 3, position = [4, 5, 6]
* Object 3: [7, 8, 9], size = 3, position = [7, 8, 9]

Now, let's apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence. Based on the given examples, we can observe that the following operations are applied:

* Move objects: Object 1 is moved one position to the right, while Object 2 is moved two positions to the left. Object 3 remains unchanged.
* Scale objects: Object 1 is scaled down by a factor of 2, while Object 2 is scaled up by a factor of 2. Object 3 remains unchanged.
* Remove objects: Object 1 is removed from the sequence.
* Recolor objects: Object 2 is recolored to red, while Object 3 remains unchanged.

Applying these operations to the input sequence results in the following transformed sequence:

Transformed sequence: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As requested, here are the descriptions for each of the input-output pairs:

Example 1:
Input sequence: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output sequence: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Description: In this example, the input sequence contains three objects of size 2 each, aligned horizontally. The transformation moves the middle object to the right, scales the top and bottom objects down by a factor of 2, removes the middle object, and recolors the remaining objects to black.

Example 2:
Input sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Description: In this example, the input sequence contains four objects of size 8 each, aligned vertically. The transformation moves the top and bottom objects down by one position, scales the middle object up by a factor of 2, removes the top and bottom objects, and recolors the remaining objects to blue.

Example 3:
Input sequence: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output sequence: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Description: In this example, the input sequence contains seven objects of size 7 each, aligned horizontally. The transformation moves the middle object to the right, scales the top and bottom objects down by a factor of 2, removes the middle object, and recolors the remaining objects to green.

Finally, regarding the test case input sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], the transformation pattern applies the same operations as in the previous examples. Therefore, the transformed sequence would be:

Transformed sequence: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps you understand the transformation pattern and create the necessary code to perform the desired transformation! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
