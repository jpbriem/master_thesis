The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. All elements in the input sequence are either 0 or 4, except for one element at index 5, which is 2. Similarly, all elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 4, except for one element at index 5, which is also 2. It seems that there is no transformation happening between adjacent elements in the input sequence, but there is some sort of grouping or alignment happening between elements in the output sequence.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. However, there are some differences in the distribution of values between the two sequences. In the input sequence, there are three consecutive elements that are all equal to 2, while in the output sequence, these elements are scattered randomly throughout the sequence. It appears that there is some sort of rearrangement or shuffling happening between elements in the output sequence.\n* Example_3: This is the most interesting case among the three, as the input sequence consists of only four elements, and the output sequence also has only four elements. Moreover, all elements in the input sequence are equal to 4, while all elements in the output sequence are equal to 0. It seems that there is some sort of filtering or masking happening between elements in the output sequence, where any element that is not equal to 0 is removed.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple bitwise XOR operation, where each element in the input sequence is XORed with a fixed constant (either 0 or 4) to produce the corresponding element in the output sequence. This would explain why there are no transformations happening between adjacent elements in the input sequence, and why there are some groups of identical elements in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the above transformation, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has the same structure as the input sequence, but with all elements XORed with a fixed constant (in this case, 3). This demonstrates that the given transformation action can indeed be used to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFinally, here is the requested JSON data structure containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs.\",\n  \"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step.\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[copy the test case input sequence from the task]. Mind the sequence length!\",\n    \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n    \"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n  },\n  \"test_output\": \"[return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!]\"\n}\n```"
