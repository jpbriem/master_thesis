The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are two objects in the output sequence (Object_1 and Object_2). Object_1 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], and Object_2 is located at positions [6, 7, 8]. The size of Object_1 is 2 pixels, and the size of Object_2 is 1 pixel.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there is one object in the output sequence (Object_1). Object_1 is located at positions [0, 0, 8], and it has a size of 8 pixels.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3. The output sequence also consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are two objects in the output sequence (Object_1 and Object_2). Object_1 is located at positions [0, 0, 3], and Object_2 is located at positions [4, 4, 4]. The size of Object_1 is 3 pixels, and the size of Object_2 is 1 pixel.\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple scaling operation. Specifically, the output sequence can be obtained by scaling the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions. This means that if the input sequence has a size of nx Ny, the output sequence will have a size of 2nx 2ny.\n\nNow, let's apply this scaling operation to a new input sequence. Suppose the input sequence is:\n\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWe can apply the scaling operation to obtain the output sequence as follows:\n\n[0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has twice the size of the input sequence in both the x and y directions. This suggests that the simplest possible relation between input and output is indeed a simple scaling operation.\n\nTherefore, the transformation action for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence is as follows:\n\n'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.'\n\n'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by applying a scaling operation to the input sequence, with a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.'\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
