[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. All elements in the input sequence are 0 or 4, except for the last element which is 3. Similarly, all elements in the output sequence are 0 or 4, except for the last element which is also 3. It seems that there is no transformation happening between adjacent elements in the input sequence, but the last element in the input sequence is transformed to become the last element in the output sequence.
* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. All elements in the input sequence are either 2 or 5, while all elements in the output sequence are either 2 or 0. It appears that the even numbered elements in the input sequence are transformed into 0, while the odd numbered elements are transformed into 2.
* Example_3: This is the most complex example so far, with an input sequence consisting of 16 elements and an output sequence consisting of 16 elements as well. Most of the elements in both the input and output sequences are 0 or 5, but there are some differences in the positions where these elements appear. Specifically, the last 4 elements in the input sequence are transformed into the first 4 elements in the output sequence, while the remaining elements in the input sequence remain unchanged.

Based on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple shift operation, where each element in the input sequence is shifted by one index towards the right, and the resulting element is used as the corresponding element in the output sequence. However, there may be additional transformations happening depending on the specific input sequence provided.

Now, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Transformed output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As expected, the transformation simply shifts each element in the input sequence by one index towards the right, resulting in the same output sequence.

Therefore, my answer to the question "What is the simplest possible relation between input and output?" is that the input and output sequences follow a simple shift operation, where each element in the input sequence is shifted by one index towards the right, and the resulting element is used as the corresponding element in the output sequence.
