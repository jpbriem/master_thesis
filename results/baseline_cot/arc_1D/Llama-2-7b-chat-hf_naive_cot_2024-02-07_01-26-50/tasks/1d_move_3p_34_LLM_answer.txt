You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Move the first object (Object_1) two positions to the right.

Input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 2: Scale Object_1 horizontally by a factor of 2.

Input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 3: Remove Object_2 from the sequence.

Input: [0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 4: Recolor Object_1 to red (value = 3).

Input: [0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Step 5: Move Object_1 one position to the left.

Input: [0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

And so on. Note that these steps can be applied recursively to any subsequent input sequences.

Therefore, the overall pattern for transforming an input sequence into its output sequence is as follows:

* Move the first object two positions to the right.
* Scale the first object horizontally by a factor of 2.
* Remove the second object from the sequence.
* Recolor the first object to a random value (between 0 and 9).
* Move the first object one position to the left.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
