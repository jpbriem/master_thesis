The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences share a similar pattern, where each element in the sequence corresponds to a pixel in an image. The differences between the input and output sequences lie in the values assigned to each pixel. In the input sequence, each pixel has a value of either 0 (background) or 1-9 (different colors). In the output sequence, each pixel has a value of either 0 (background) or 1-9 (different colors), but with some modifications.\n\nFor example, in the first input sequence, there are two objects: Object_1 and Object_2. Object_1 consists of three pixels with values 2, 2, and 2, while Object_2 consists of one pixel with a value of 3. In the output sequence, these objects are transformed in the following ways:\n\n* Object_1 is moved two positions to the right.\n* Object_2 is scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nThese transformations result in the output sequence, where each pixel value is determined by the combination of the original pixel value and the transformation applied to it.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the input-output pairs is that they consist of a series of pixels, where each pixel has a value of either 0 (background) or 1-9 (different colors). The differences between the input and output sequences lie in the values assigned to each pixel, which are modified through various transformations. These transformations include moving, scaling, and modifying the color values of the pixels.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes, positions, and colors.\n2. Apply the necessary transformations to each object, taking into account its size, position, and color. These transformations may involve moving, scaling, or modifying the color values of the pixels.\n3. Combine the transformed objects to form the output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo perform the transformations required to transform the input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and create a new variable to hold the transformed sequence.\n2. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation based on the type of object it belongs to. This may involve moving, scaling, or modifying the color values of the pixel.\n3. Store the transformed pixel value in the new variable.\n4. Repeat step 2 until all pixels in the input sequence have been transformed.\n5. Return the transformed sequence as the output sequence.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nUsing the provided input sequence, the transformed sequence would look like this:\n```json\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0"
