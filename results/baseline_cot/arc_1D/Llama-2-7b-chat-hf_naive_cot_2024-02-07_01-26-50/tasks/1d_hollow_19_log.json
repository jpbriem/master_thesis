The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has one of nine possible values (0-8) representing different colors. The input and output sequences may also contain \"noise\" pixels, which are pixels that do not belong to any object.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Describe the difference between the input and output sequences for each example provided:\n\nInput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n* The input sequence contains three objects, each consisting of three pixels with the same color. The output sequence contains two objects, each consisting of two pixels with the same color. One object has been removed, and the remaining object has been resized to half its original size.\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n* The input sequence contains five objects, each consisting of five pixels with the same color. The output sequence contains four objects, each consisting of five pixels with the same color. Two objects have been removed, and the remaining objects have been resized to half their original size.\n\nInput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n* The input sequence contains three objects, each consisting of three pixels with the same color. The output sequence contains two objects, each consisting of three pixels with the same color. One object has been removed, and the remaining object has been resized to half its original size.\n\n2. Describe the overall pattern of the input-output relationship:\n\nThe overall pattern of the input-output relationship appears to be that objects in the input sequence are transformed through various operations, including removal, resizing, and color change. These operations result in a simplified output sequence with fewer objects than the input sequence.\n\n3. Provide instructions on how to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nTo transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\na. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.\nb. Apply the necessary transformations to each object, based on the logic provided earlier (e.g., move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor).\nc. Position the transformed objects in the output sequence.\nd. Repeat steps b and c until no more objects remain in the input sequence.\n\n4. Describe the transformed objects in the output sequence:\n\nFor the given input sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the transformed objects in the output sequence would be:\n\nObject 1: {color: 1, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, size: 2}\nObject 2: {color: 1, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 1}\nObject 3: {color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1}\n\nEach object has been transformed through the specified operations based on the logic provided earlier.\n\n5. Return the created test output sequence:\n\nThe created test output sequence for the given input sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]."
