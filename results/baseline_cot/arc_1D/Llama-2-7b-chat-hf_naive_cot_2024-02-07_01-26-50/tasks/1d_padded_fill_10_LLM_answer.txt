prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.

From the given examples, it seems that the transformation from input to output involves the following steps:

1. Movement: Objects in the input sequence may move to different positions in the output sequence.
2. Scaling: Objects in the input sequence may be resized or scaled up or down in the output sequence.
3. Rotation: Objects in the input sequence may rotate or change their orientation in the output sequence.
4. Alignment: Objects in the input sequence may be aligned differently in the output sequence, possibly due to rotation or movement.
5. Overlap: Objects in the input sequence may overlap each other in the output sequence, leading to changes in their sizes and positions.
6. Containment: Objects in the input sequence may be contained within other objects in the output sequence, leading to changes in their sizes and positions.

Based on these observations, I will now attempt to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence using the following steps:

Step 1: Move all objects in the input sequence to their starting positions.
Step 2: Scale all objects in the input sequence to their original sizes.
Step 3: Rotate all objects in the input sequence to their original orientations.
Step 4: Align all objects in the input sequence to their original positions.
Step 5: Check for overlapping objects in the input sequence and adjust their positions accordingly.
Step 6: Check for contained objects in the input sequence and adjust their positions accordingly.

After applying these steps to the test input sequence, I get the following output sequence:

Output sequence:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Note that this is just one possible way to transform the input sequence into its output sequence, and there may be other valid ways to do so depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
