The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The objects are also assigned a unique identifier (start index, end index, and size) to distinguish them from each other.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves applying a series of logical rules to the input sequence, which are as follows:\n\n1. Move an object to the right by one pixel if there is no object to the left of it.\n2. If there are two or more objects touching each other horizontally, merge them into a single object.\n3. Scale an object up or down by a factor of 2 if there is another object of the same color immediately to the left or right of it.\n4. Remove an object if there is no other object of the same color immediately to the left or right of it.\n5. Copy an object exactly as it appears in the input sequence to the output sequence.\n6. Recolor an object to match the color of the object it is overlapping.\n7. Sort the objects in the output sequence based on their x-coordinate.\n\nBased on these rules, the output sequence for the given input sequence is:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input sequence contains 5 objects. Object_1 is moved to the right by one pixel due to lack of space to the left. Object_2 is merged with Object_1 since they are touching horizontally. Object_3 is scaled up by a factor of 2 due to lack of space to the right. Object_4 is removed since there is no other object of the same color immediately to the left of it. Object_5 is copied exactly as it appears in the input sequence to the output sequence.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, the input sequence contains 7 objects. Object_1 is moved to the right by one pixel due to lack of space to the left. Object_2 is merged with Object_1 since they are touching horizontally. Object_3 is scaled up by a factor of 2 due to lack of space to the right. Object_4 is removed since there is no other object of the same color immediately to the left of it. Object_5 is copied exactly as it appears in the input sequence to the output sequence.\"\n}\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Move, merge, scale, remove, copy, recolor\"\n\"instructions\": \"Transform the input sequence by applying the above rules. Focus on the positions, sizes, and colors of the objects.\"\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}, Object_3: {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}, Object_3: {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}\"\n\"output\": \"[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n\nI hope this helps!
