The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my understanding of the task:\n\nInput: A 1D numpy array of integers representing a sequence of pixels, where each integer value corresponds to one of the following colors: 0 (background), 1-9 (different object colors).\nOutput: A 1D numpy array of integers representing the corresponding transformed sequence of pixels, where each integer value corresponds to one of the following colors: 0 (background), 1-9 (different object colors).\n\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n\n* For each pixel in the input sequence, check if it belongs to an existing object. If it does, apply the following transformation rules:\n\t+ If the pixel belongs to an object with color = 2, move it two positions to the right.\n\t+ If the pixel belongs to an object with color = 3, remove it from the sequence.\n\t+ If the pixel belongs to an object with color = 4, scale it up by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double its width and height).\n\t+ If the pixel belongs to an object with color = 5, rotate it clockwise by 90 degrees.\n\t+ If the pixel belongs to an object with color = 6, flip it horizontally.\n\t+ If the pixel belongs to an object with color = 7, mirror it vertically.\n\t+ If the pixel belongs to an object with color = 8, stretch it horizontally by a factor of 2.\n\t+ If the pixel belongs to an object with color = 9, shrink it horizontally by a factor of 2.\n* If there are no more pixels belonging to existing objects, add a new object with color = 0 (background) at the end of the sequence.\n\nHere are some examples of input and output sequences to illustrate the transformation rule:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, given the test case input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I would apply the transformation rule as follows:\n\n1. Check if any of the pixels belong to existing objects. Since none of the pixels belong to existing objects, we create a new object with color = 0 (background) at the end of the sequence.\n2. Move the first pixel (0) two positions to the right, so it becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0].\n3. Remove the second pixel (0) since it belongs to an object with color = 3.\n4. Rotate the third pixel (0) clockwise by 90 degrees since it belongs to an object with color = 5.\n5. Flip the fourth pixel (0) horizontally since it belongs to an object with color = 6.\n6. Mirror the fifth pixel (0) vertically since it belongs to an object with color = 7.\n7. Stretch the sixth pixel (0) horizontally by a factor of 2 since it belongs to an object with color = 8.\n8. Shrink the seventh pixel (0) horizontally by a factor of 2 since it belongs to an object with color = 9.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, "
