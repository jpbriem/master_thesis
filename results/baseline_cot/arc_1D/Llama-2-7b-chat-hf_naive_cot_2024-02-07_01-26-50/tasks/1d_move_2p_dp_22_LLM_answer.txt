You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In the input sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], there are two objects:

Object 1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}
Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}

Step 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object

For Object 1, we need to apply the following rules:

* Move one position to the right (i.e., from index 1 to index 2)
* Scale by a factor of 2 (i.e., double the size)
* Remove the middle pixel (i.e., the one at index 2)

So, the transformed Object 1 looks like this:

{color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 2}

For Object 2, we need to apply the following rules:

* Move one position to the left (i.e., from index 8 to index 7)
* Scale by a factor of 2 (i.e., double the size)
* Remove the middle pixel (i.e., the one at index 7)

So, the transformed Object 2 looks like this:

{color: 9, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 1}

Step 3: Combine the transformed objects with the remaining pixels

In the output sequence, we want to combine the transformed objects with the remaining pixels in the following way:

* For each pixel that is part of an object, keep its original value;
* For each pixel that is not part of an object, take the average of the surrounding pixels (i.e., the ones at indices 1, 2, and 3).

Using these rules, we can create the output sequence [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern of the transformation appears to be moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. The specific rules for each operation are not explicitly stated in the problem statement, but they can be inferred based on the given examples.

Instructions:
To transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the same criteria as before (i.e., find the pixels that are part of an object and group them together).
2. Apply the transformation rules to each object in the following order: move, scale, remove, recolor.
3. Combine the transformed objects with the remaining pixels in the output sequence using the rules provided above.

Transformation:
Here's how I would perform the transformation on the test input sequence:

Input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence:
	* Object 1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}
	* Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}
2. Apply the transformation rules to each object:
	* Object 1: move one position to the right, scale by a factor of 2, remove the middle pixel
	* Object 2: move one position to the left, scale by a factor of 2, remove the middle pixel
3. Combine the transformed objects with the remaining pixels:
	* For each pixel that is part of an object, keep its original value;
	* For each pixel that is not part of an object, take the average of the surrounding pixels (i.e., the ones at indices 1, 2, and 3).

Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Note that this is just one possible implementation of the transformation rule, and there may be other valid ways to interpret and apply the rule.
