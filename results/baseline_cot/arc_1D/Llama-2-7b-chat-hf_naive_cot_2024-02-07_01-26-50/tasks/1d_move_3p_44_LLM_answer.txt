You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem! Here's my answer:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel value ranging from 1 to 9 (representing different colors) and 0 (representing the background color). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include their starting index, ending index, and size.

Based on the given examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and recoloring the objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels present in the input sequence that need to be handled.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we will need to perform the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (starting index, ending index, and size).
2. Apply the necessary transformations to each object, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring.
3. Handle any noise pixels present in the input sequence.
4. Create the output sequence by combining the transformed objects.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation seems to involve manipulating the objects in the input sequence according to some rule, and then combining them to form the output sequence. The exact nature of these rules is not specified in the problem statement, but they seem to involve mathematical operations and comparisons based on the properties of the objects.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (starting index, ending index, and size).
2. Apply the necessary transformations to each object, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring.
3. Handle any noise pixels present in the input sequence.
4. Combine the transformed objects to create the output sequence.

**Transformation**

To transform the input sequence, we will need to perform the following operations:

1. Copy the input sequence and store it in a variable called `input`.
2. Iterate through each object in the input sequence and apply the necessary transformations based on the properties of the object. For example, if an object has a size of 2, we can move it 2 positions to the right in the output sequence. If an object has a color of 3, we can replace it with a new pixel of color 3 in the output sequence.
3. Handle any noise pixels present in the input sequence by simply ignoring them or replacing them with a default value (e.g., 0).
4. Combine the transformed objects to create the output sequence. We can do this by concatenating the transformed objects along the axis of the input sequence.

**Test Output**

Here is the test output sequence for the input sequence `[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`:
```json
[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
```
Note that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
