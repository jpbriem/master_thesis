The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with each object being larger than the previous one.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of a single large object surrounded by smaller objects, with some noise pixels in between. The output sequence consists of the same arrangement of objects and noise pixels, but with each object being larger than the previous one.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of a single large object surrounded by smaller objects, with no noise pixels in between. The output sequence consists of the same arrangement of objects and noise pixels, but with each object being larger than the previous one.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves scaling up the objects in the input sequence by a fixed amount in each iteration, while maintaining their relative positions and sizes. Specifically, the scaling factor appears to be equal to 2 in all three examples.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the above observation, we can transform this input sequence as follows:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the input sequence:\n\t* If the current element is greater than 0, scale it up by a factor of 2 and place it at the corresponding position in the output sequence.\n\t* Otherwise, leave the element unchanged and place it at the corresponding position in the output sequence.\n2. Repeat step 1 until the end of the input sequence is reached.\n\nThe resulting output sequence would be:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has the same structure as the input sequence, but with each object being larger than the previous one. Note that the scaling factor of 2 was chosen based on the observation made from the input-output pairs provided, but the actual value of the scaling factor could be any positive integer."
