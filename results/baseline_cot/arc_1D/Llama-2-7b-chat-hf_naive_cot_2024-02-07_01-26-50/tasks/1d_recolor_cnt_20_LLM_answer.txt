You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the objects seem to be moved, resized, and aligned with each other. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], there are three objects:

* Object 1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 3}
* Object 2: {color: 8, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 2}
* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 10, end_index: 10, size: 1}

Step 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object

Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the transformation pattern involves moving, resizing, and aligning the objects with each other. Here's how I would apply these rules to each object in the input sequence:

Object 1: Move 3 positions to the right, resize to size 5, and align with Object 2.
Object 2: Move 2 positions to the left, resize to size 3, and align with Object 1.
Object 3: Remove.

Step 3: Combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence

After applying the transformation rules to each object, we get the following transformed objects:

* Object 1: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 5}
* Object 2: {color: 8, start_index: 3, end_index: 5, size: 3}
* Object 3: None (removed)

We can then combine these transformed objects into a single output sequence by concatenating them in the correct order:

Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Note that the length of the output sequence will depend on the length of the input sequence, so make sure to adjust accordingly when implementing this solution.
