You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem! Here's my answer:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel value ranging from 1 to 9 (representing different colors) and 0 (representing the background color). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include their starting index, ending index, and size.

Based on the given examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and removing objects. Additionally, there may be arithmetical operations involving the objects, such as counting and sorting. Finally, there may be conditions that affect the transformation process.

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I would follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (starting index, ending index, and size).
2. Apply the necessary transformation operations to each object, taking into account its properties and any conditions that need to be satisfied. These operations could include moving an object to a new location, scaling it up or down, aligning it with other objects, overlapping it with other objects, or removing it entirely.
3. Once all objects have been transformed, apply any remaining arithmetical operations (such as counting or sorting) to the resulting sequence.

Here are some more specific instructions for each input-output pair:

* Input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0] - In this case, no objects were present in the input sequence, so no transformation was applied.
* Input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0] - In this case, two objects were present in the input sequence, and they were moved one position to the right.
* Input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] - In this case, three objects were present in the input sequence, and they were aligned horizontally.
* Input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0] - In this case, four objects were present in the input sequence, and they were sorted vertically.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
