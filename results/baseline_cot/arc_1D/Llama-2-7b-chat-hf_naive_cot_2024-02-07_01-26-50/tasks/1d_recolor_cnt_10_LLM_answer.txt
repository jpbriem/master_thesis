You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are specified in the output sequence.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions, sizes, and colors.
2. Move each object to its corresponding position in the output sequence.
3. Scale each object to its correct size in the output sequence.
4. Repeat the process until all objects have been moved, scaled, and placed in the output sequence.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is to move, scale, and place objects in the output sequence based on their positions, sizes, and colors in the input sequence. The transformation rule is applied repeatedly until all objects have been processed.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Copy the input sequence and create a new empty sequence.
2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions, sizes, and colors.
3. Move each object to its corresponding position in the new sequence.
4. Scale each object to its correct size in the new sequence.
5. Repeat the process until all objects have been moved, scaled, and placed in the new sequence.

**Transformation**

Here's the detailed transformation rule for each object in the input sequence:

* Move each object to its corresponding position in the output sequence. The position of an object is determined by its starting index and ending index in the input sequence.
* Scale each object to its correct size in the output sequence. The size of an object is determined by its width and height in the input sequence.
* If an object has a non-zero background color, set its color to the background color.

**Test Output**

Here's the test output sequence generated using the above transformation rule:
```json
[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Note that the test output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
