[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:

output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 11 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. Each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 2, indicating that all pixels have been colored white.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 11 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. Each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 1, indicating that all pixels have been colored black or white, respectively.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. Each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 6, indicating that all pixels have been colored either black or red, respectively.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves simply assigning a color (either 0, 1, 2, or 6) to each pixel in the input sequence, without any complex operations involved. Therefore, my inference is that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one mapping, where each input pixel is assigned a unique color in the output sequence.

Now, let's apply this inference to a new input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Using the above inference, we can transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:

Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As expected, the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and each pixel value is assigned a unique color based on the values in the input sequence. Note that since there are no noise pixels in the input sequence, there are no noise pixels in the output sequence either.

Therefore, my answer to the question is:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'No change', 'Example_2': 'All pixels colored black or white', 'Example_3': 'All pixels colored red or black'}, 'overall_pattern': 'One-to-one mapping between input and output pixels', 'instructions': 'Transform each input pixel into a unique color in the output sequence', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence', 'object_description': 'Each object represents a single pixel in the input sequence', 'transformed_objects': 'Each transformed object represents a unique color in the output sequence', 'output': 'Create the resulting output sequence' }, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format'}
