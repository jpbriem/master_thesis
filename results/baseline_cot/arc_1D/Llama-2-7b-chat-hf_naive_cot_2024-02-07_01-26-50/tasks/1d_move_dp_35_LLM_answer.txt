You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In the input sequence [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0], there are 7 objects of size 7 each. These objects can be identified by their starting index, ending index, and size. For example, the first object has a starting index of 0, an ending index of 7, and a size of 7.

Step 2: Apply the transformation rules to the objects

Based on the given transformation pattern, we need to apply the following rules to the objects in the input sequence:

* Move the objects by 1 position to the right (i.e., shift the entire object by 1 position to the right).
* Scale the objects by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions (i.e., double the size of the object in both dimensions).
* Remove the middle 4 objects (i.e., the objects at indices 4 through 7).
* Recolor the remaining objects to have a color of 6 instead of their original color.

Here's how these rules would be applied to the objects in the input sequence:

Object 1: Move the object by 1 position to the right, so it now starts at index 8. Scale the object by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, so it now has a size of 14. Since the middle 4 objects were removed, this object is not affected by that rule. Recolor the object to have a color of 6.

Object 2: Move the object by 1 position to the right, so it now starts at index 9. Scale the object by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, so it now has a size of 18. Since the middle 4 objects were removed, this object is not affected by that rule. Recolor the object to have a color of 6.

And so on for the remaining objects in the sequence.

Step 3: Combine the transformed objects back into a single sequence

After applying the transformation rules to each object, we need to combine the transformed objects back into a single sequence. In this case, we simply concatenate the transformed objects together, starting from the last object and moving backwards towards the first object.

So, the transformed output sequence would be:

[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Note that the order of the objects in the output sequence is the reverse of the order they appeared in the input sequence. Also, the sizes of the objects in the output sequence are twice the sizes of the corresponding objects in the input sequence.

That's it! This is how I would approach this problem using the given transformation pattern. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
