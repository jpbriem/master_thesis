You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence according to certain rules. Here's what I observe:

* In each input sequence, there are one or more objects (represented by non-zero values) that are adjacent to each other.
* The objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, scaling, rotating, removing, copying, and recoloring.
* The distance between objects, their alignment, and their overlap with other objects are also important factors in determining the transformation rules.
* Noise pixels are present in some input sequences, which may affect the transformation process.

To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I would follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence.
Step 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object, taking into account its position, size, color, and any other relevant factors.
Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until no further transformations are applied to an object.

Here are some specific instructions for each step:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence.

* Look for consecutive non-zero values in the input sequence. These represent the objects.
* Record the starting index, ending index, and size of each object.
* If there are multiple objects in the input sequence, repeat this process for each object.

Step 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object.

* Refer to the given examples to understand the transformation rules.
* For each object, apply the appropriate transformation rule(s) based on its position, size, color, and any other relevant factors.
* Use logical reasoning to determine the outcome of each transformation rule application.

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until no further transformations are applied to an object.

* Once an object has been transformed, do not apply any further transformation rules to it.
* Move on to the next object in the input sequence and repeat Steps 2 and 3 until all objects have been processed.

For the given test input sequence, here's how I would apply these steps:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence.

* There are three objects in the input sequence: Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3.
* Object_1 starts at index 1 and ends at index 4, with a size of 2 pixels.
* Object_2 starts at index 5 and ends at index 6, with a size of 1 pixel.
* Object_3 starts at index 7 and ends at index 8, with a size of 2 pixels.

Step 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object.

* Object_1: Move Object_1 two positions to the right (i.e., from index 1 to index 3).
* Object_2: Remove Object_2 (since it is only one pixel wide and does not interact with any other object).
* Object_3: Scale Object_3 up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions (i.e., increase its size by 2x2=4 pixels).

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until no further transformations are applied to an object.

* After applying the above transformations, the input sequence becomes:
	+ Object_1: {start_index: 3, end_index: 5, size: 2}
	+ Object_2: None (removed)
	+ Object_3: {start_index: 9, end_index: 11, size: 4}

Now, let's transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the same transformation pattern:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence.

* There are still three objects in the input sequence: Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3.

Step 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object.

* Object_1: Move Object_1 two positions to the right (i.e., from index 3 to index 5).
* Object_2: None (no changes since it was removed earlier).
* Object_3: Scale Object_3 down by a factor of 2 in both dimensions (i.e., decrease its size by 2x2=4 pixels).

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until no further transformations are applied to an object.

* After applying the above transformations, the output sequence becomes:
	+ Object_1: {start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 2}
	+ Object_2: None (removed)
	+ Object_3: {start_index: 11, end_index: 13, size: 2}

And that's it! This is how I would transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the observed transformation pattern.
