[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating whether it belongs to an object or not. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating whether it belongs to an object or not. However, there is a difference in the positions of the objects in the input and output sequences. In the input sequence, objects are placed randomly, while in the output sequence, objects are aligned horizontally and their positions are shifted by one index.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 12 elements, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating whether it belongs to an object or not. The output sequence also consists of 12 elements, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating whether it belongs to an object or not. However, there is a difference in the sizes of the objects in the input and output sequences. In the input sequence, some objects have a size of 3, while in the output sequence, these objects have a size of 7.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating whether it belongs to an object or not. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating whether it belongs to an object or not. However, there is no difference in the positions or sizes of the objects in the input and output sequences.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a simple translation, where each object in the input sequence is translated by one index in the output sequence. This means that if an object is located at position i in the input sequence, it will be located at position i+1 in the output sequence.

Now, let's apply this translation rule to a new input sequence:

Input sequence: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Using the translation rule, we can translate each element in the input sequence by one index in the output sequence, resulting in the following output sequence:

Output sequence: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Therefore, the transformation action required to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence is simply applying a translation by one index to each element in the input sequence.
