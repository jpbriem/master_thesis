You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.

To begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Example_1:
Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0]`
Output: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0]`

From the input sequence, we can observe that there are two objects:

Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
Object 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}

The output sequence also contains these two objects, but with slight modifications:

Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
Object 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}

It appears that the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input objects without any modification. Therefore, the transformation rule for this example can be represented as:

Transformation Rule: Copy the input objects unchanged.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test input sequence:

Test Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]`

Using the transformation rule, we can generate the output sequence as follows:

Test Output: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0]`

As expected, the output sequence contains the same objects as the input sequence, but with their positions shifted by one index due to the zero-based indexing convention.

For the remaining input-output pairs, we can apply the same transformation rule and obtain the following outputs:

Example_2:
Input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0]`

Example_3:
Input: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]`
Output: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0]`

In both cases, the transformation rule applies without any modification, resulting in the same output sequence as the input sequence.

Therefore, the overall pattern for transforming the input sequence into the output sequence can be summarized as:

Overall Pattern: Copy the input objects unchanged.

Finally, here are the requested fields for the test case:

Description:
Regarding the test input, the objects in the input sequence are:

* Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}
* Object 2: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 1}

Transformed Objects:
The transformed objects in the output sequence are:

* Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}
* Object 2: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 1}

Output:
Create the resulting test output sequence: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
