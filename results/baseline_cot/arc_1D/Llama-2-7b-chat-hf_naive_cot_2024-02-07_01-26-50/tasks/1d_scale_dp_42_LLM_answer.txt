[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6]

input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the given examples:

Example 1:
The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. In the output sequence, each object has been scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Additionally, two noise pixels have been added at the beginning and end of the output sequence.

Example 2:
The input sequence consists of a single object (represented by non-zero values) surrounded by noise pixels. The output sequence also consists of a single object, but with some modifications. In the output sequence, the object has been moved one position to the right and one position downwards compared to the input sequence. Additionally, three noise pixels have been added at the top and bottom of the output sequence.

Example 3:
The input sequence consists of multiple objects (represented by non-zero values) separated by noise pixels. The output sequence also consists of multiple objects, but with some modifications. In the output sequence, each object has been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees compared to the input sequence. Additionally, two noise pixels have been added at the beginning and end of the output sequence.

Based on these examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the positions, sizes, and orientations of objects in the input sequence to create the corresponding output sequence. Specifically, the objects in the input sequence seem to be subject to the following operations:

* Scaling: The objects in the input sequence are scaled up by a fixed factor in both dimensions.
* Movement: The objects in the input sequence are moved relative to their neighbors in the output sequence.
* Rotation: The objects in the input sequence are rotated clockwise by a fixed angle compared to their neighbors in the output sequence.
* Addition: Noise pixels are added to the input sequence to create the output sequence.

Now, let me apply these insights to the given test case:

Input sequence: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

From the analysis above, we can infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is to modify the positions, sizes, and orientations of the objects in the input sequence to create the corresponding output sequence. Specifically, we can apply the following operations to the input sequence:

* Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both dimensions to create the output sequence.
* Move the objects in the input sequence relative to their neighbors in the output sequence.
* Rotate the objects in the input sequence clockwise by 90 degrees compared to their neighbors in the output sequence.
* Add noise pixels to the input sequence to create the output sequence.

Applying these operations to the given test case yields the following output sequence:

Output sequence: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the transformation rule for the given test case is:

Transformation rule: Scale the objects by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, move them relative to their neighbors, rotate them clockwise by 90 degrees, and add noise pixels to create the output sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
