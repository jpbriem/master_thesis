            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Understand the input sequence\nThe input sequence consists of 11 pixels, each with a value between 1 and 9, representing different pixel colors. There are two objects in the input sequence, both of which are rectangular in shape and have a size of 2 pixels each. The first object has a color of 2, and the second object has a color of 3.\n\nStep 2: Identify the transformation rules\nFrom the given input-output pairs, we can identify some common transformation rules that are applied to the input sequence. These include:\n\n* Moving an object: The input sequence contains two objects, and each object can be moved left or right by one pixel.\n* Scaling an object: Each object can be scaled up or down by a factor of 2.\n* Removing an object: One of the objects in the input sequence can be removed by setting its value to 0.\n* Recoloring an object: Each object can be recolored to any of the other colors in the range (1-9).\n\nStep 3: Determine the transformation actions\nBased on the transformation rules identified in Step 2, we need to determine the specific actions that will transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence. Here are the transformation actions for the given input sequence:\n\n* Move the first object left by one pixel.\n* Scale the second object up by a factor of 2.\n* Remove the third object (which has a value of 0).\n* Recolor the remaining objects to the color 2.\n\nStep 4: Apply the transformation actions\nOnce we have determined the transformation actions, we can apply them to the input sequence to obtain the output sequence. Here's how the transformation actions would be applied to the input sequence:\n\n* Move the first object left by one pixel: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n* Scale the second object up by a factor of 2: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 0, 4, 8, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n* Remove the third object (which has a value of 0): [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n* Recolor the remaining objects to the color 2: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nAnd there you have it! By applying the transformation actions to the input sequence, we can obtain the desired output sequence."
