The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. All elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 2, except for one element at index 5, which is 3.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 12 elements, and the output sequence also has 12 elements. All elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 8, except for one element at index 6, which is 0.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. All elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 3, except for one element at index 7, which is 3.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple bitwise operation, where each element in the input sequence is replaced by a corresponding element in the output sequence. Specifically, if an element in the input sequence is 0, it remains 0 in the output sequence; otherwise, it becomes 2.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the above transformation rule, we get the following output sequence:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs requested, here are the descriptions for each field:\n\n* `description`: This field contains a brief description of the difference between the input and output sequences. For Example_1, the description is \"All elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 2, except for one element at index 5, which is 3.\" For Example_2, the description is \"All elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 8, except for one element at index 6, which is 0.\" For Example_3, the description is \"All elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 3, except for one element at index 7, which is 3.\"\n* `overall_pattern`: This field contains a brief description of the overall pattern observed in the input-output pairs. For Example_1, the overall pattern is \"Simple bitwise operation: replace 0 with 2, and leave other elements unchanged.\" For Example_2, the overall pattern is \"Simple bitwise operation: replace 0 with 8, and leave other elements unchanged.\" For Example_3, the overall pattern is \"Simple bitwise operation: replace 0 with 3, and leave other elements unchanged.\"\n* `instructions`: This field contains a set of instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the observed pattern. For Example_1, the instructions are \"Replace each element in the input sequence with the corresponding element in the output sequence.\" For Example_2, the instructions are \"Replace each element in the input sequence with the corresponding element in the output sequence, modulo 2.\" For Example_3, the instructions are \"Replace each element in the input sequence with the corresponding element in the output sequence, modulo 3.\"\n* `transformation`: This field contains a description of the transformation applied to the input sequence to obtain the output sequence. For Example_1, the transformation is \"Replace each element in the input sequence with the corresponding element in the output sequence.\" For Example_2, the transformation is \"Replace each element in the input sequence with the corresponding element in the output sequence, modulo 2.\" For Example_3, the transformation is \"Replace each element in the input sequence with the corresponding element in the output sequence, modulo 3.\"\n* `test_output`: This field contains the actual output sequence obtained by applying the transformation to the input sequence."
