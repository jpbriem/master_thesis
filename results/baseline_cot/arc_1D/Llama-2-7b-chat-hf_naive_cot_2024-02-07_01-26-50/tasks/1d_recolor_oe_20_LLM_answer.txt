You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating pixels of color 0 (background) and color 9 (object). The output sequence also consists of alternating pixels of color 0 and color 9, but with some pixels shifted horizontally compared to the input sequence. Specifically, every other pixel in the output sequence has moved one position to the right compared to the corresponding pixel in the input sequence.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of a single object spanning multiple pixels, with each pixel having color 9. The output sequence consists of multiple objects, each with a different color. Each object is centered at a particular position in the output sequence, and the sizes of the objects vary.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of a single object spanning multiple pixels, with each pixel having color 9. The output sequence also consists of multiple objects, but with some pixels shifted horizontally compared to the input sequence. Specifically, every other pixel in the output sequence has moved one position to the right compared to the corresponding pixel in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves shifting pixels horizontally in the output sequence relative to their positions in the input sequence. Additionally, the size and color of the objects in the output sequence may differ from those in the input sequence.

Now, let's consider how we can transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using this transformation pattern. Suppose we have a new input sequence `x` of length `n`. We can transform `x` into its corresponding output sequence `y` by applying the following steps:

1. Shift each pixel in `x` horizontally by a fixed amount (e.g., one position), so that the resulting sequence `y'` has the same number of pixels as `x`, but with each pixel shifted over by one position.
2. Apply a scaling operation to `y'` to adjust the size of the objects in the sequence. Specifically, we can set the scale factor `s` to be a constant value greater than 1, and then multiply each pixel in `y'` by `s` to enlarge the objects.
3. Repeat step 2 for each object in `y'`, using a different scaling factor for each object. This will create multiple objects in the output sequence with varying sizes.
4. Center each object in `y'` at a particular position, using the position of the first pixel in the object as the center point.
5. Sort the pixels in each object in `y'` according to their color, starting from the center pixel and moving outward. This will arrange the pixels in each object in a specific order.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each object in `y'`, using a different sorting algorithm for each object. This will create a unique ordering of the pixels within each object.
7. Output the resulting sequence `y''`, which contains the transformed pixels from the original input sequence `x`.

Therefore, the overall transformation pattern for transforming an input sequence `x` into its corresponding output sequence `y` can be represented as follows:
```
x -> y' -> y''
```
where `y'` is the sequence obtained after shifting and scaling the pixels in `x`, and `y''` is the final output sequence containing the transformed pixels.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
