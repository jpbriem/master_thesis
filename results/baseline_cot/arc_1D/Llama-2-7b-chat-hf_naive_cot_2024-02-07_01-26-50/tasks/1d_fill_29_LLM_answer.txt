You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2.
In the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 0), we need to move Object 1 to the right by one position. Therefore, the transformed output sequence will have Object 1 at position 2 instead of position 1.

Step 2: Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 horizontally.
In the input sequence, Object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. Since the scaling factor is 2, we need to double the width of Object 2 in both directions. Therefore, the transformed output sequence will have Object 2 with a width twice as large as the original width.

Step 3: Remove Object 3.
In the input sequence, there is no Object 3. Therefore, we don't need to do anything to remove it.

Step 4: Recolor Object 1 to green (value = 9).
In the input sequence, Object 1 has a color value of 2. Since we want to recolor Object 1 to green (value = 9), we simply replace the color value of Object 1 with 9.

Step 5: Copy Object 2 and move it to position 6.
In the input sequence, Object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. We need to copy Object 2 and move it to position 6 in the output sequence. Therefore, the transformed output sequence will have two instances of Object 2, one at position 4 and another at position 6.

Step 6: Scale Object 4 by a factor of 2 vertically.
In the input sequence, Object 4 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8. Since the scaling factor is 2, we need to double the height of Object 4 in both directions. Therefore, the transformed output sequence will have Object 4 with a height twice as large as the original height.

Step 7: Remove Object 5.
In the input sequence, there is no Object 5. Therefore, we don't need to do anything to remove it.

Step 8: Recolor Object 6 to blue (value = 4).
In the input sequence, Object 6 has a color value of 6. Since we want to recolor Object 6 to blue (value = 4), we simply replace the color value of Object 6 with 4.

Step 9: Move Object 7 to position 0.
In the input sequence, Object 7 has a starting index of 10 and an ending index of 10. Since the starting index of Object 7 is greater than the starting index of Object 0 (which is 0), we need to move Object 7 to the left by one position. Therefore, the transformed output sequence will have Object 7 at position 0 instead of position 10.

And that's it! By applying these steps to the input sequence, we can transform it into the desired output sequence.
