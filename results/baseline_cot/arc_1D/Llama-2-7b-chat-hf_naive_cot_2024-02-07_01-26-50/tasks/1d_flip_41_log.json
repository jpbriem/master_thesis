            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn the input sequence provided, there are three objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 8, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 9, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nBased on the given transformation pattern, we can apply the following transformations to each object:\n\n* Move Object 1 one position to the right (i.e., from index 1 to index 2).\n* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., from index 6 to index 7 and from index 8 to index 9).\n* Remove Object 3 (since it has a size of 1 and is located at the last position of the sequence).\n\nStep 3: Update the positions and sizes of the remaining objects\n\nAfter applying the transformations, the positions and sizes of the remaining objects will change as follows:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 5, start_index: 2, end_index: 4, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 8, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 2}\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until no more transformations are applied\n\nSince the given input sequence contains multiple objects, we need to repeat steps 1-3 until no more transformations are applied. In other words, we need to iterate over the sequence multiple times, applying transformations to each object in turn.\n\nHere's an example of how the output sequence could be generated using these transformations:\n\nOutput sequence:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence has been transformed into an output sequence where each object has been moved one position to the right, scaled by a factor of 2 in both directions, and removed if its size was equal to 1.\n\nOverall pattern:\nThe overall pattern of the transformation appears to involve applying a series of operations to each object in the input sequence, including moving, scaling, removing, and recoloring. These operations are applied repeatedly until no more transformations are required.\n\nTransformation instructions:\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Apply the transformations listed above to each object, starting with the first object and repeating until no more transformations are required.\n3. Update the positions and sizes of the remaining objects after each transformation.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more transformations are applied.\n\nNote that the transformations may be applied in any order, but it's important to apply them consistently throughout the process."
