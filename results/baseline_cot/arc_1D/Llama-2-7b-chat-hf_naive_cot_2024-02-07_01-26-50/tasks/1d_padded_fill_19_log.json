The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, rotating, and merging objects.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. **Move**: Shift the entire input sequence by 1 pixel to the right.\n2. **Scale**: Multiply each pixel value in the input sequence by a factor of 2.\n3. **Rotate**: Rotate the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise.\n4. **Merge**: Merge adjacent pixels of the same color in the input sequence to form larger objects.\n5. **Remove**: Remove any pixel that is not part of an object.\n6. **Recolor**: Replace each pixel value in the output sequence with the average color of the surrounding pixels.\n7. **Copy**: Copy the entire input sequence to the output sequence without making any changes.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation of each step:\n\n1. **Move**: The input sequence is shifted by 1 pixel to the right, effectively moving the entire sequence one pixel to the right. This step helps to align the objects in the input sequence properly.\n2. **Scale**: Each pixel value in the input sequence is multiplied by a factor of 2, effectively doubling the size of each object in the input sequence. This step helps to enlarge the objects in the input sequence.\n3. **Rotate**: The input sequence is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise, effectively changing the orientation of the objects in the input sequence. This step helps to mix up the objects in the input sequence.\n4. **Merge**: Adjacent pixels of the same color in the input sequence are merged to form larger objects. The size of each object is determined by the number of pixels it contains. This step helps to combine smaller objects into larger ones.\n5. **Remove**: Any pixel that is not part of an object is removed from the input sequence. This step helps to eliminate any unnecessary pixels in the input sequence.\n6. **Recolor**: Each pixel value in the output sequence is replaced with the average color of the surrounding pixels. This step helps to blend the objects in the input sequence together.\n7. **Copy**: The entire input sequence is copied to the output sequence without making any changes. This step helps to preserve the original structure of the input sequence.\n\nBased on these steps, here's how the input sequence [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] gets transformed into the output sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
