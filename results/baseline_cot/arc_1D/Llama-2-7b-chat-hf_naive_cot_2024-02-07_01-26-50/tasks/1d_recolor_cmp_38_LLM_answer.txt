[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

Example_1:
Input: [0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9]
Output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9]

From this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are moved one position towards the right with each iteration. Additionally, the size of each object remains constant throughout the sequence.

Example_2:
Input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, we can see that the objects in the input sequence are aligned horizontally, and their sizes remain constant.

Example_3:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

From these examples, we can conclude that the transformation pattern involves moving objects one position towards the right, aligning them horizontally, and scaling them up by a factor of 2.

Now, let us apply these transformation actions to a new input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Using the transformation actions learned from the previous examples, we can transform this input sequence as follows:

Output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

As you can see, the objects in the input sequence are moved one position towards the right, aligned horizontally, and scaled up by a factor of 2. The final output sequence has the same number of objects as the original input sequence, but with their positions shifted one position towards the right.

Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one mapping between the objects in the input sequence and their corresponding positions in the output sequence. The transformation actions involve moving, scaling, and aligning the objects in the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence.
