You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences share a similar pattern, where each object (represented by a consecutive sequence of identical values) is transformed in a consistent manner. Specifically:

* Objects are moved towards the right by one position.
* Objects are resized to half their original size.
* Objects are aligned horizontally with the previous object.

Based on these rules, we can infer the following transformation pattern for the given input sequence:

Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0]`

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:

1. Move each object towards the right by one position.
2. Resize each object to half its original size.
3. Align each object horizontally with the previous object.

By applying these three steps consistently to each object in the input sequence, we obtain the corresponding output sequence.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the transformation rules to each object:
a. Move the object towards the right by one position.
b. Resize the object to half its original size.
c. Align the object horizontally with the previous object.
3. Add the transformed object to the output sequence.
4. Repeat step 2 until the entire input sequence has been processed.

**Transformation**

Here are the detailed transformation instructions for each field in the JSON structure:

* **input**: Copy the provided input sequence as it is.
* **object_description**: Describe each object in the input sequence based on its size, position, and color. For example:
	+ Object 1: Size = 8, Position = 4, Color = 2.
	+ Object 2: Size = 8, Position = 6, Color = 3.
* **transformed_objects**: Describe how each transformed object should look like in the output sequence based on its size, position, and color. For example:
	+ Transformed Object 1: Size = 4, Position = 5, Color = 2.
	+ Transformed Object 2: Size = 4, Position = 7, Color = 3.
* **output**: Create the resulting output sequence by adding the transformed objects to it.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
