[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3]
output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In the input sequence [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], there are two objects:

Object 1: {color: 6, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}
Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 5, end_index: 5, size: 1}

Step 2: Apply transformations to the objects

For each object, apply the appropriate transformation operation based on the given pattern. Here are the transformations I would apply:

Object 1: Move 2 positions to the right (i.e., at index 7)

Object 2: Scale by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double the size)

Step 3: Update the output sequence

After applying the transformations, update the output sequence accordingly:

Output sequence: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Explanation:

* The first object remains unchanged at index 1.
* The second object moves one position to the right and doubles in size, becoming the new object at index 5.
* The remaining elements of the input sequence remain unchanged.

Now, please provide me with the next input sequence, and I will apply the above steps to transform it into the corresponding output sequence.
