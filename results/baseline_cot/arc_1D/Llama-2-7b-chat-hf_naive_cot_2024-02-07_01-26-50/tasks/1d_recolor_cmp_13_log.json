The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that each object in the input sequence has been transformed into an equivalent-sized object in the output sequence, while maintaining their original color and position. Moreover, there seems to be a rule where any two adjacent objects of the same color in the input sequence become one large object in the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nSimilar to Example 1, each small object in the input sequence has been transformed into an equivalent-sized object in the output sequence, while maintaining their original color and position. However, this time, there appears to be no rule for combining adjacent objects of the same color in the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, again, each small object in the input sequence has been transformed into an equivalent-sized object in the output sequence, while maintaining their original color and position. This time, however, it seems that any two adjacent objects of the same color in the input sequence become one large object in the output sequence, regardless of their position.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can expect the following transformation:\n\nOutput: [0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, each small object in the input sequence has been transformed into an equivalent-sized object in the output sequence, while maintaining their original color and position. Again, there seems to be a rule where any two adjacent objects of the same color in the input sequence become one large object in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is that each small object in the input sequence becomes an equivalent-sized object in the output sequence, while maintaining their original color and position, and any two adjacent objects of the same color in the input sequence become one large object in the output sequence.\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can simply iterate through the input sequence, applying the above transformation rule for each small object. For example, if the next input value is 1, we would transform it into a 7 in the output sequence, since that is the largest object of the same color as the input value. If the next input value is another 1, we would transform it into another 7 in the output sequence, and so on.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
