The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, and recoloring the objects. The noise pixels are also taken into account during the transformation process.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.\n2. Apply the specified operations to each object, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, and recoloring.\n3. Take into account the noise pixels and adjust the output sequence accordingly.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:\n\n* Move the objects towards the right by 1 pixel at a time.\n* Scale the objects by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n* Hollow out the objects by removing half of their height and width.\n* Copy the remaining parts of the objects and paste them after the last object.\n* Recolor the copied objects to match the background color.\n* Take into account the noise pixels and adjust the output sequence accordingly.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and make it the new input sequence.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.\n3. Apply the specified operations to each object, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, and recoloring.\n4. Take into account the noise pixels and adjust the output sequence accordingly.\n5. Return the resulting output sequence as the transformed output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how to perform the transformation for the given input sequence:\n\n1. Input: `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\t* Object 1: {color: 6, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\n\t* Object 2: {color: 6, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\n3. Apply the specified operations to each object:\n\t* Move Object 1 to the right by 1 pixel.\n\t* Scale Object 1 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n\t* Hollow out Object 1 by removing half of its height and width.\n\t* Copy Object 2 and paste it after Object 1.\n\t* Recolor Object 2 to match the background color.\n4. Take into account the noise pixels and adjust the output sequence accordingly:\n\t* Add a noise pixel at index 7.\n5. Return the resulting output sequence: `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nNote that the transformation pattern may vary depending on the specific input sequence provided."
