The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2.\nIn the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 4), we need to move Object 1 to position 2.\n\nStep 2: Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\nObject 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4, indicating that it spans two positions in the input sequence. By scaling it by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, we can make it twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 3: Remove Object 3.\nObject 3 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8, indicating that it spans one position in the input sequence. Since the starting index of Object 3 is greater than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 4), we can safely remove it without affecting the overall structure of the output sequence.\n\nStep 4: Recolor Object 1 to have a color of 7 instead of 5.\nIn the input sequence, Object 1 has a color of 5. By recoloring it to have a color of 7 instead, we can give it a distinctly different appearance from the other objects in the output sequence.\n\nStep 5: Move Object 4 to Position 6.\nObject 4 has a starting index of 12 and an ending index of 12, indicating that it spans two positions in the input sequence. By moving it to position 6 in the output sequence, we can create some space between Object 4 and the other objects in the output sequence.\n\nStep 6: Scale Object 5 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\nObject 5 has a starting index of 16 and an ending index of 16, indicating that it spans two positions in the input sequence. By scaling it by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, we can make it twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 7: Remove Object 7.\nObject 7 has a starting index of 20 and an ending index of 20, indicating that it spans one position in the input sequence. Since the starting index of Object 7 is greater than the starting index of Object 5 (which is 16), we can safely remove it without affecting the overall structure of the output sequence.\n\nStep 8: Recolor Object 2 to have a color of 4 instead of 7.\nIn the input sequence, Object 2 has a color of 7. By recoloring it to have a color of 4 instead, we can give it a distinctly different appearance from the other objects in the output sequence.\n\nStep 9: Move Object 8 to Position 10.\nObject 8 has a starting index of 24 and an ending index of 24, indicating that it spans two positions in the input sequence. By moving it to position 10 in the output sequence, we can create some space between Object 8 and the other objects in the output sequence.\n\nStep 10: Scale Object 9 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\nObject 9 has a starting index of 28 and an ending index of 28, indicating that it spans two positions in the input sequence. By scaling it by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, we can make it twice as large as it was originally.\n\nAnd there you have it! Applying these steps to the given input sequence results in the output sequence shown above.\n\nAs for the noise pixels, they don't seem to play any significant role in the transformation pattern. We can simply ignore them and focus on the main objects in the input sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
