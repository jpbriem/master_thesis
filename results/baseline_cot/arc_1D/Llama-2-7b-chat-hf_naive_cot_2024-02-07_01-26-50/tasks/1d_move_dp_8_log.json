            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 6]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given examples and instructions, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has one of nine possible values (0-8) representing different colors. The input and output sequences also have some additional structures, such as objects and noise pixels, which need to be taken into account during the transformation process.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the input and output sequences provided in the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0]`\n\nFrom the input sequence, we can observe that there are two objects: Object 1 has color 2 and starts at index 1, ending at index 2, with size 2; Object 2 has color 3 and starts at index 4, ending at index 4, with size 1. The remaining pixels are noise pixels.\n\nSimilarly, the output sequence has two objects: Object 1 has the same properties as in the input sequence, while Object 2 has the same properties but with a shift of one pixel to the right. All other pixels are noise pixels.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 6]`\n\nIn this case, there is only one object in the input sequence, which has color 8 and starts at index 0, ending at index 8, with size 8. The remaining pixels are noise pixels. Similarly, the output sequence has only one object, which has the same properties as in the input sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6]`\n\nHere, there are no objects in the input sequence, and all pixels are noise pixels. In the output sequence, there is only one object, which has color 8 and starts at index 0, ending at index 8, with size 8.\n\nNow, let's consider the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]`\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can infer that the input sequence will have multiple objects, each with a unique color and size. We can also expect some noise pixels in the input sequence.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (color, size, position).\nStep 2: Transform each object in the input sequence according to the given transformation rules (e.g., move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor).\nStep 3: Position each transformed object in the output sequence based on its properties (color, size, position).\nStep 4: Add any necessary noise pixels to the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for this problem could be summarized as follows:\n\nTransformation Rule:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their unique colors and sizes.\n2. Apply transformation rules to each object, such as moving, scaling, copying, etc.\n3. Position each transformed object in the output sequence based on its properties.\n4. Add any necessary noise pixels to the output sequence.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the problem better and come up with a solution! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
