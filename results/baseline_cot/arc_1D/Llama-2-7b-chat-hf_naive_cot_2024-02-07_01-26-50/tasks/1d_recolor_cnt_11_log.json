The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Additionally, there are noise pixels that need to be taken into account.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the input sequence [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0].\n\nObjects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 9, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}\n* Object_2: {color: 9, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}\n* Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 2}\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence. Here are the steps involved:\n\nStep 1: Move Object_1 one position to the right.\n\nNew position of Object_1: {start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3}\n\nStep 2: Scale Object_2 by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., x2 and y2).\n\nNew position of Object_2: {start_index: 2, end_index: 5, size: 4}\n\nStep 3: Remove Object_3.\n\nObject_3 is no longer present in the sequence.\n\nStep 4: Add a new object at position 8 with color 9.\n\nNew position of Object_3: {start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}\n\nStep 5: Recolor Object_1 to color 7.\n\nNew position of Object_1: {start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3}\n\nAnd finally, we add some noise pixels to the sequence. Let's assume there are 3 noise pixels with colors 0, 2, and 9.\n\nNoise pixels positions: [9, 2, 0]\n\nAfter applying these transformations, the resulting output sequence would look something like this:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern can be summarized as follows:\n\nInput \u2192 Move Object_1 \u2192 Scale Object_2 \u2192 Remove Object_3 \u2192 Add new object \u2192 Recolor Object_1 \u2192 Add noise pixels\n\nI hope this helps you understand the transformation pattern better! Can you please provide me with more input sequences to practice?"
