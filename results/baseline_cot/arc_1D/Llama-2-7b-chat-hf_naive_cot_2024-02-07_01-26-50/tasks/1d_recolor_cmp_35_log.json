The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here are some observations and hypotheses about the transformation pattern:\n\n* Pixels with the same color as the background (i.e., 0) remain unchanged in both the input and output sequences.\n* Pixels with a color different from the background are either moved, resized, or recolored based on their relative positions and distances from other colored pixels.\n* The distance between two colored pixels appears to be a key factor in determining the transformation operation applied to them. For instance, pixels that are adjacent to each other (i.e., have a distance of 1) may be merged or combined in some way, while pixels that are farther apart may be moved or resized independently.\n* The color of a pixel also seems to play a role in determining the transformation operation. For example, pixels with the same color as another nearby pixel may be recolored to match that color, while pixels with a distinct color may be left unchanged or even inverted.\n\nWith these observations in mind, here is a step-by-step guide to transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Copy the input sequence as is and store it in a variable called `input`.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence, starting from the first one. At each iteration, check the color of the current pixel and compare it to the colors of neighboring pixels (i.e., pixels located at indices `-1`, `0`, `1`, and `2`). Based on these comparisons, apply the appropriate transformation operation to the current pixel, such as moving, resizing, recoloring, or leaving it unchanged.\n\nStep 3: Once the entire input sequence has been processed, create an empty output sequence and iterate through each pixel in the input sequence again, applying the transformation operations just applied to each pixel in the output sequence. Store each transformed pixel in the output sequence.\n\nHere is some sample Python code that implements these steps:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Copy the input sequence as is and store it in a variable called 'input'\ninput = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\n\n# Step 2: Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence, applying transformation operations based on color and spatial relationships\nfor i in range(len(input)):\n    # Check the color of the current pixel and compare it to neighboring pixels\n    if input[i] == 0:\n        # If the current pixel is the background color, leave it unchanged\n        pass\n    elif input[i] == input[i - 1]:\n        # If the current pixel is the same color as the previous pixel, merge them\n        input[i] = input[i - 1]\n    elif abs(input[i] - input[i + 1]) <= 1:\n        # If the current pixel is near a pixel with the same color, resize or move it\n        if input[i] > input[i + 1]:\n            input[i] -= 1\n        else:\n            input[i] += 1\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, recolor the current pixel based on its color and the colors of nearby pixels\n        if input[i] == 1:\n            input[i] = 3\n        elif input[i] == 2:\n            input[i] = 1\n        else:\n            input[i] = 2\n\n# Step 3: Create an empty output sequence and iterate through each pixel in the input sequence again, applying transformation operations\noutput = np.zeros((len(input)), dtype=np.uint8)\nfor i in range(len(input)):\n    output[i] = input[i]\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input sequence has a length that is a power of 2 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.). If the input sequence has a different length, you may need to adjust the loop boundaries accordingly.\n\nFinally, here is the JSON response for the given input sequence:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, the difference between the input and output sequences is that the objects in the input sequence have been transformed into larger versions of themselves in the output sequence.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Transformations based on color and spatial relationships between objects\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Apply the following transformation actions to a new input sequence: Move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\",\n        \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, the objects are the individual pixels with unique colors.
