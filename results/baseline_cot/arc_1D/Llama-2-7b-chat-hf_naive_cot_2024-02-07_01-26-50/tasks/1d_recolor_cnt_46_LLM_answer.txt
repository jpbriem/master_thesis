You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include size, position, and color. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, removing, copying, and recoloring. Additionally, there are noise pixels that do not belong to any object.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).
2. Apply the necessary operations to each object in the input sequence, based on the transformation pattern. These operations may involve moving an object to a different position, scaling it up or down, removing an object entirely, copying another object, or recoloring an object.
3. Take into account the noise pixels and ignore them when applying the transformations.
4. Output the resulting sequence of transformed objects.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:

* Move objects horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., +1 or -1 pixel).
* Scale objects by a factor (e.g., 2x or 0.5x).
* Remove an object entirely if it has no neighboring objects of the same color.
* Copy an object from a specific position and merge it with another object at a different position.
* Recolor an object to a new color based on a specified rule (e.g., always change the color of an object to the next number in the sequence).

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).
2. Apply the necessary operations to each object in the input sequence, based on the transformation pattern. These operations may involve moving an object to a different position, scaling it up or down, removing an object entirely, copying another object, or recoloring an object.
3. Take into account the noise pixels and ignore them when applying the transformations.
4. Output the resulting sequence of transformed objects.

**Transformation**

Here are the detailed instructions for each operation:

1. **Move**: Move an object horizontally or vertically by a fixed amount (e.g., +1 or -1 pixel). Update the position of the object accordingly.
2. **Scale**: Scale an object by a factor (e.g., 2x or 0.5x). Update the size of the object accordingly.
3. **Remove**: If an object has no neighboring objects of the same color, remove it entirely from the sequence.
4. **Copy**: Copy an object from a specific position and merge it with another object at a different position. Update the position and size of the copied object accordingly.
5. **Recolor**: Recolor an object to a new color based on a specified rule (e.g., always change the color of an object to the next number in the sequence). Update the color property of the object accordingly.

**Test Output**

Using the given input sequence, here is the resulting test output sequence:
```json
[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Note that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence and contains only the objects that were present in the input sequence after applying the transformation pattern.
