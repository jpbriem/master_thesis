The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a simple pattern:\n\n* For each object in the input sequence, move it to the next position in the output sequence.\n* If an object overlaps with another object in the output sequence, remove one of them (the smaller one).\n* If an object has no neighboring objects in the output sequence, remove it.\n\nHere are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their positions and sizes.\n3. Move each object to the next position in the output sequence.\n4. Check for overlapping objects in the output sequence and remove any unnecessary ones.\n5. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to move each object to the next position in the output sequence while avoiding overlaps with other objects. If there are multiple objects at the same position in the output sequence, only one of them will be retained, and the others will be removed.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo perform the transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Copy the input sequence**: `input = np.array(input)`\n2. **Identify the objects in the input sequence**: Find the contiguous regions of the same color in the input sequence. Each region corresponds to an object.\n3. **Determine the positions and sizes of the objects**: For each object, find its starting and ending index in the input sequence and calculate its size (i.e., the number of pixels it covers).\n4. **Move each object to the next position in the output sequence**: For each object, move it to the next position in the output sequence. If the next position is beyond the end of the output sequence, wrap around to the beginning of the sequence.\n5. **Check for overlapping objects in the output sequence**: For each pair of adjacent objects in the output sequence, check if they overlap. If they do, remove the smaller one.\n6. **Remove unnecessary objects**: For each object in the output sequence that has no neighboring objects, remove it.\n7. **Return the resulting output sequence**: `output = np.array(output)`.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nFor the given input sequence `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the transformation would result in the output sequence `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
