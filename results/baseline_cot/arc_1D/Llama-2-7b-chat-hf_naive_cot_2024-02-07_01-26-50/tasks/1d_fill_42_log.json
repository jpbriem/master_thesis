The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'm ready to help you with this problem! Based on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Describe the difference between the input and output sequences for each example provided:\n\nInput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n* The main difference between the input and output sequences is that the output sequence has duplicate copies of some of the input pixels, with their positions shifted by one index. Specifically, the second and fourth pixels in the input sequence become the first and third pixels in the output sequence, respectively.\n\nInput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n* Similarly, the output sequence has duplicate copies of some of the input pixels, but with their positions shifted by two indices. The second and fourth pixels in the input sequence become the first and third pixels in the output sequence, respectively.\n\nInput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n* In this case, the output sequence has the same pixels as the input sequence, but with no duplicates.\n\n2. Describe the overall pattern in the input-output relationships:\n\nBased on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation pattern involves duplicating some of the input pixels and shifting them by one or two indices in the output sequence. This creates a repeating pattern of colors in the output sequence.\n\n3. Provide instructions on how to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nTo transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\na. Copy the input sequence.\nb. Shift the copied sequence by one or two indices, depending on the number of duplicate copies required.\nc. Repeat step b until all pixels in the input sequence have been shifted into the output sequence.\nd. Remove any redundant pixels from the output sequence.\n\nFor example, if the new input sequence is [0, 2, 2, 0, 3], you would first copy the sequence, then shift the copied sequence by one index to create the first duplicate copy. You would then repeat this process for the remaining pixels in the input sequence, shifting each copy by one or two indices as necessary. Finally, you would remove any redundant pixels from the output sequence to obtain the final result.\n\n4. Describe the transformed objects in the output sequence:\n\nIn the output sequences provided, there are no objects with non-zero sizes. Therefore, the transformed objects in the output sequence will also have zero sizes. However, the positions of the transformed objects may differ from those in the input sequence due to the shifting operation.\n\n5. Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format:\n\nHere is the created test output sequence for the given input sequence [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]:\n\noutput = np.array([0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0])"
