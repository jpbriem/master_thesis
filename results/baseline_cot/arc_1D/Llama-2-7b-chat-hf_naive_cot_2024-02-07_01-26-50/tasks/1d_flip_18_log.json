The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to position 2.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 is located at index 1, while in the output sequence, it is located at index 2. To achieve this movement, we simply shift the entire object 1 to the right by one position in the input sequence.\n\nStep 2: Scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 2 has a size of 3, while in the output sequence, it has a size of 6. To achieve this scaling, we multiply each element of object 2 in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both dimensions (i.e., x2 in the x direction and y2 in the y direction).\n\nStep 3: Remove object 3.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 3 is located at index 4, but it does not exist in the output sequence. To remove an object from the input sequence, we simply delete the elements of the object in the input sequence.\n\nStep 4: Recolor object 4 to have a color of 1.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 4 has a color of 3, while in the output sequence, it has a color of 1. To achieve this recoloring, we simply replace each element of object 4 in the input sequence with the corresponding element of the output sequence, where the color is replaced by the desired value of 1.\n\nStep 5: Overlap objects 5 and 6.\n\nIn the input sequence, objects 5 and 6 are located adjacent to each other, while in the output sequence, they are overlapping. To achieve this overlap, we simply concatenate the elements of objects 5 and 6 in the input sequence, starting from their common boundary.\n\nStep 6: Sort the output sequence lexicographically.\n\nIn the output sequence, the elements are sorted lexicographically based on their color values. Specifically, the colors are sorted in descending order (i.e., largest to smallest), and the elements are arranged accordingly in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, when applied to the given input sequence, these steps will result in the output sequence shown above.\n\nRegarding the overall pattern, it appears that the transformation involves applying a series of operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, removing, recoloring, and overlapping objects. These operations are applied in a specific order, with some operations depending on the results of previous operations. However, the exact rules governing these operations are not explicitly stated in the problem statement, so we must rely on reasoning and inference to determine the necessary transformations."
