You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the given examples:

Example 1:
Input: `[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

From this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are grouped together based on their color. The objects are also aligned horizontally. In the output sequence, some of the objects are moved or resized, while others remain unchanged. It seems that the transformation pattern involves moving or resizing objects based on their color.

Example 2:
Input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

In this example, the objects in the input sequence are again grouped based on their color. However, there are more complex transformations involved in this example. Some objects are moved or resized, while others are removed or replaced. It seems that the transformation pattern involves a combination of moves, scales, and replacements based on object color.

Now, let me apply these insights to the given test case:

Input: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Based on the observed patterns in the previous examples, I will propose the following transformation steps:

1. Move Object_1 (size = 2) two positions to the right.
2. Scale Object_2 (size = 3) by a factor of 2 in both horizontal directions.
3. Remove Object_3 (size = 0).
4. Replace Object_4 (size = 8) with a smaller version of itself (size = 6).
5. Move Object_5 (size = 8) one position to the left.
6. Resize Object_6 (size = 8) to half its original size.
7. Move Object_7 (size = 0) one position to the right.

These steps result in the following transformed output sequence:

Output: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Note that the resulting output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.

Finally, I will provide the transformed output sequence in JSON format:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Move, scale, remove, replace, align', 'instructions': 'Transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence by applying the above transformation steps. Think step by step.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format.'}
