The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are simply moved one position to the right in the output sequence. Specifically, if an object has a size of `n` in the input sequence, it will have a size of `n+1` in the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, we can see that the objects in the input sequence are simply rotated by one position in the output sequence. Specifically, if an object has a size of `n` in the input sequence, it will have a size of `n-1` in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can expect the output sequence to have the following properties:\n\n* The objects in the input sequence will be moved one position to the right in the output sequence.\n* The objects in the input sequence will be rotated by one position in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence for the given input sequence would be:\n\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nAs requested, here is the description of the transformation actions required to transform a new input into its corresponding output:\n\n1. Move each object in the input sequence one position to the right in the output sequence.\n2. Rotate each object in the input sequence by one position in the output sequence.\n\nAnd finally, here is the JSON representation of the transformed output sequence:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. What changed HOW?\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Move each object in the input sequence one position to the right in the output sequence.\",\n\"transformations\": {\n\"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence.\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}"
