The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are specified in the output sequence.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions, sizes, and colors.\n2. Move each object to its corresponding position in the output sequence.\n3. Scale each object to its correct size in the output sequence.\n4. Repeat the process until all objects have been moved, scaled, and placed in the output sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to move, scale, and place objects in the output sequence based on their positions, sizes, and colors in the input sequence. The transformation rule is applied repeatedly until all objects have been processed.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and create a new variable to hold the transformed output sequence.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions, sizes, and colors.\n3. Apply the transformation rule to each object, moving it to its corresponding position in the output sequence, scaling it to its correct size, and placing it at its correct position.\n4. Repeat the process until all objects have been transformed and placed in the output sequence.\n5. Return the transformed output sequence as a numpy array.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how to perform the transformation for the given input sequence:\n\n1. Input sequence: `[0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n2. Identify objects: There are two objects in the input sequence, each consisting of three consecutive pixels of the same color.\n3. Move objects: Move the first object to position `0` in the output sequence, and move the second object to position `6` in the output sequence.\n4. Scale objects: Scale the first object to size `3` in the output sequence, and scale the second object to size `9` in the output sequence.\n5. Place objects: Place the first object at position `(0, 0)` in the output sequence, and place the second object at position `(6, 6)` in the output sequence.\n\nThe transformed output sequence would be:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Move, scale, and place objects in the output sequence based on their positions, sizes, and colors in the input sequence.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Transform a new input sequence by identifying objects, applying the transformation rule, and placing them in the output sequence.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n        \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!
