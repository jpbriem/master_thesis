The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and ones, while the output sequence also consists of alternating zeros and ones but with some elements changed to sixes. It seems that the transformation rule is simply replacing each element with the nearest neighbor (i.e., the previous or next element) modulo 2.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and threes, while the output sequence consists of alternating zeros and twos. Again, it seems that the transformation rule is replacing each element with the nearest neighbor modulo 2.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and fours, while the output sequence consists of alternating zeros and threes. Once again, it appears that the transformation rule is replacing each element with the nearest neighbor modulo 2.\n\nNow, let us apply these insights to a new input sequence:\n\nTest Case:\nInput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the observed patterns in the input-output pairs, we can propose a simple transformation rule for this input sequence: replace each element with the nearest neighbor modulo 2. That is, if an element is even, replace it with 0; otherwise, replace it with 4.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\nTransformed Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nSo, the transformation rule for this specific test case is indeed to replace each element with the nearest neighbor modulo 2.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON response for this test case:\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[copy the test case input sequence from the task]\",\n\"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n\"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence.\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[return the created test output sequence in numpy array format]\"\n}"
