The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of 10 zeros followed by a single non-zero element (4) at the end. The output sequence also consists of 10 zeros followed by a single non-zero element (4) at the end. It seems that the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input sequence without any modification. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a one-to-one mapping.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of 10 zeros followed by a single non-zero element (5) at the end. The output sequence consists of 10 zeros followed by a single non-zero element (5) at the end, but with the elements shifted by one index compared to the input sequence. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves shifting the elements in the output sequence by one index compared to the input sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of 7 ones followed by 4 zeros. The output sequence consists of 7 ones followed by 4 zeros, but with the elements shifted by one index compared to the input sequence. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves shifting the elements in the output sequence by one index compared to the input sequence.\n\nNow, let me apply these insights to transform a new input sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:\n```markdown\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nBased on the given examples and the inference made above, the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a one-to-one mapping. Therefore, I will transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"No change\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"Shifted by 1 index\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"One-to-one mapping\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Copy the input sequence without any modification.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[0, 0,..., 0]\",\n        \"object_description\": [],\n        \"transformed_objects\": [],\n        \"output\": \"[0, 0,..., 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[0, 0,..., 0]\"\n}\n```\nNote that since the input and output sequences have the same length, there is no need to pad the input sequence before transforming it. Also, since the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input sequence without any modification, there are no transformed objects to describe."
