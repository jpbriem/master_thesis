prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 13 elements, where each element is either 0 (background) or 3 (red). The output sequence consists of 13 elements as well, where each element is either 0 (background) or 3 (red), but with some elements shifted compared to the input sequence. Specifically, the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, and twelfth elements of the output sequence are equal to the corresponding elements of the input sequence, while the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth elements of the output sequence are equal to the corresponding elements of the input sequence plus 3.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 16 elements, where each element is either 0 (background) or 0 (red). The output sequence consists of 16 elements as well, where each element is either 0 (background) or 0 (red), but with some elements shifted compared to the input sequence. Specifically, the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, twelfth, and sixteenth elements of the output sequence are equal to the corresponding elements of the input sequence, while the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh elements of the output sequence are equal to the corresponding elements of the input sequence minus 1.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 elements, where each element is either 0 (background) or 1 (green). The output sequence consists of 8 elements as well, where each element is either 0 (background) or 1 (green), but with some elements shifted compared to the input sequence. Specifically, the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth elements of the output sequence are equal to the corresponding elements of the input sequence, while the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements of the output sequence are equal to the corresponding elements of the input sequence plus 1.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves shifting and scaling the input sequence, possibly with some additional arithmetical operations.

Now, let's consider a new input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can apply the following steps:

Step 1: Shift the input sequence by 3 positions to the right, so that the first element of the output sequence becomes the fourth element of the input sequence.

Step 2: Scale the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions, so that the first element of the output sequence becomes twice the value of the first element of the input sequence, and the last element of the output sequence becomes half the value of the last element of the input sequence.

Step 3: Add 3 to each element of the output sequence, so that the first element of the output sequence becomes the value of the first element of the input sequence plus 3, and the last element of the output sequence becomes the value of the last element of the input sequence plus 3.

Applying these steps to the given input sequence yields the following output sequence:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196, 203, 210, 217, 224, 231, 238, 245, 252, 259, 266, 273, 280, 287, 294, 301, 308, 315, 322, 329, 336, 343, 350, 357, 364, 371, 378, 385, 392, 399, 406, 413, 420, 427, 434, 441, 448, 455, 462, 469, 476, 483, 490, 497, 504, 511, 518, 525, 532, 539, 546, 553, 560, 567, 574, 581, 588, 595, 602, 609, 616, 623, 630, 637, 644, 651, 658, 665, 672, 679, 686, 693, 700, 707, 714, 721, 728, 735, 742, 749, 756, 763, 770, 777, 784, 791, 798, 805, 812, 819, 826, 833, 840, 847, 854, 861, 868, 875, 882, 889, 896, 903, 910, 917, 924, 931, 938, 945, 952, 959, 966, 973, 979, 986, 993, 999, 1006, 1013, 1020, 1027, 1034, 1041, 1048, 1055, 1062, 1069, 1076, 1083, 1090, 1097, 1104, 1111, 1118, 1125, 1132, 1139, 1146, 1153, 1160, 1167, 1174, 1181, 1188, 1195, 1202, 1209, 1216, 1223, 1230, 1237, 1244, 1251, 1258, 1265, 1272, 1279, 1286, 1293, 1300, 1307, 1314, 1321, 1328, 1335, 1342, 1349, 1356, 1363, 1370, 1377, 1384, 1391, 1398, 1405, 1412, 1419, 1426, 1433, 1440, 1447, 1454, 1461, 1468, 1475, 1482, 1489, 1496, 1503, 1510, 1517, 1524, 1531, 1538, 1545, 1552, 1559, 1566, 1573, 1580, 1587, 1594, 1601, 1608
