The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors). The output sequence also consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 0 (representing the background color). It's clear that the objects in the input sequence are the individual pixels, and their positions and sizes remain unchanged in the output sequence. Therefore, the transformation rule for this example is simply to replace each pixel value with the corresponding background color value.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 8 (representing different colors). The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 0 (representing the background color). In this example, the objects in the input sequence are the individual pixels, and their positions and sizes remain unchanged in the output sequence. However, there is a change in the color distribution - some pixels become black while others become white. Therefore, the transformation rule for this example is to randomly set the color of each pixel to either black or white, depending on its original color value.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 6 (representing different colors). The output sequence also consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 0 (representing the background color). In this example, the objects in the input sequence are the individual pixels, and their positions and sizes remain unchanged in the output sequence. There is no change in the color distribution, so the transformation rule for this example is simply to preserve the original color values of each pixel.\n\nNow, let me apply these transformation rules to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the transformation rules derived from the examples above, I can transform this input sequence into the following output sequence:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence consists of the same number of pixels as the input sequence, but with all pixel values set to 0, indicating that the objects in the input sequence have been removed or hidden.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for this problem is simply to remove any object in the input sequence that has a color value greater than 5 (i.e., the maximum color value in the problem statement). This rule can be applied to any new input sequence to produce its corresponding output sequence."
