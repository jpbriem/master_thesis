The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been reduced in size by half, and some noise pixels have been removed.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of a single object (represented by non-zero values) surrounded by noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence consists of the same object, but with some modifications. Specifically, the object has been rotated by 90 degrees clockwise, and some noise pixels have been added.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of multiple objects (represented by non-zero values) scattered throughout the sequence. Each object has a fixed size and color. The output sequence consists of the same objects, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object has been shifted by one position towards the right, and some noise pixels have been added.\n\nBased on these observations, I can make the following assumptions about the input-output relationship:\n\n1. The input sequence consists of objects and noise pixels, while the output sequence consists of modified versions of the same objects.\n2. The modification operations applied to the objects in the output sequence include scaling, rotation, and shifting.\n3. The noise pixels in the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence, except when they fall inside an object, in which case they are removed.\n\nNow, let's consider a new input sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2} and {color: 4, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}.\n\nStep 2: Apply the modification operations to each object in the input sequence. For the first object, we rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise, and for the second object, we shift it by one position towards the right.\n\nStep 3: Add noise pixels to the output sequence, preserving the original number of noise pixels in the input sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence would be [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nSo, the transformation rule for this problem can be summarized as follows:\n\nInput \u2192 Output = Modify objects (rotation, shifting, scaling) + Preserve noise pixels\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
