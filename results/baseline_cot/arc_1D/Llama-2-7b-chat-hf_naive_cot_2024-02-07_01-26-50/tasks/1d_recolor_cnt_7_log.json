            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn each input sequence, there are several distinct objects (represented by consecutive pixels of the same color) that need to be identified. In the given input sequence [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9], the objects are:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 9, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 9, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nBased on the given transformation pattern, we can apply the following transformations to each object in the input sequence:\n\n* Move Object 1 one position to the right (i.e., from index 1 to index 2).\n* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions (i.e., from size 3 to size 6).\n* Remove Object 3 (since it has a size of 1 and is therefore not considered an object).\n\nStep 3: Update the positions and sizes of the remaining objects\n\nAfter applying the transformations to Objects 1 and 2, their updated positions and sizes are as follows:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 9, start_index: 2, end_index: 4, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 6}\n\nStep 4: Calculate the noise pixels\n\nNoise pixels are pixels that do not belong to any object. Based on the given input sequence, there are two noise pixels at indices 4 and 8. Their colors are randomly selected from the range [0, 9].\n\nStep 5: Generate the output sequence\n\nFinally, we can generate the output sequence by replicating the transformed objects and adding the noise pixels. The resulting output sequence is:\n\n{color: 9, start_index: 0, end_index: 9, size: 3},\n{color: 9, start_index: 2, end_index: 4, size: 3},\n{color: 9, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 6},\n{color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1},\n{color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1},\n{color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1},\n{color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1},\n{color: 9, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1},\n{color: 9, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1},\n{color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1},\n{color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1},\n{color: 9, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1},\n{color: 9, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}\n\nNote that the resulting output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for the given input-output pairs is:\n\nInput \u2192 Transformed Input \u2192 Output\n\nI hope this helps you understand the problem better! Let me know if you have any further questions."
