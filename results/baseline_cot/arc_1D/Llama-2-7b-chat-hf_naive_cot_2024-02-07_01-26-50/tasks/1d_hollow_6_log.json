The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of 11 repeated values (5) followed by 0s. The output sequence also consists of 11 repeated values (5) followed by 0s. However, there is a change in the last element of the output sequence, where all the elements are set to 0. Therefore, the simple relation between the input and output sequences is that the last element of the output sequence is always set to 0.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of 11 repeated values (0) followed by 6 repeated values (6). The output sequence also consists of 11 repeated values (0) followed by 6 repeated values (6), but with a twist - the last element of the output sequence is set to 0. Therefore, the simple relation between the input and output sequences is that the last element of the output sequence is always set to 0.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of 7 repeated values (0) followed by 3 repeated values (3). The output sequence also consists of 7 repeated values (0) followed by 3 repeated values (3), but with a twist - the last element of the output sequence is set to 0. Therefore, the simple relation between the input and output sequences is that the last element of the output sequence is always set to 0.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to transform a new input sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:\n```markdown\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can infer that the last element of the output sequence is always set to 0. Therefore, the transformed output sequence would look like this:\n```markdown\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAs you requested, here is the description of the input-output relationship, the transformation actions, and the test output sequence in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. Be precise and say what changed how!\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[copy the test case input sequence from the task]. Mind the sequence length!\",\n        \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n        \"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[return the created test output sequence in numpy array format]. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
