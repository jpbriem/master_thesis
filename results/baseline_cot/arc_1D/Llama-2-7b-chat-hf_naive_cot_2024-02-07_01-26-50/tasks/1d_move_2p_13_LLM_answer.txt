You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2 (input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

* Move Object 1 (color = 4) from Position 0 to Position 2 in the input sequence.
* Update the color of the pixel at Position 0 in the input sequence to 0 (background color).

Step 2: Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions (input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

* Double the width and height of Object 2 (color = 4) in the input sequence.
* Update the color of the remaining pixels in the input sequence to 0 (background color).

Step 3: Remove Object 3 (input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

* Find the starting index of Object 3 (color = 4) in the input sequence.
* Remove the pixels from the starting index to the ending index of Object 3 in the input sequence.
* Update the color of the remaining pixels in the input sequence to 0 (background color).

Step 4: Recolor Object 1 to green (input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

* Replace the color of Object 1 (color = 4) in the input sequence with the color green (value = 5).

Step 5: Copy Object 2 and shift it to the right by one pixel (input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

* Create a copy of Object 2 (color = 4) in the input sequence.
* Shift the copied object to the right by one pixel in the input sequence.

Step 6: Overlap Object 1 and Object 2 (input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

* Find the starting index of Object 1 (color = 4) in the input sequence.
* Find the starting index of Object 2 (color = 4) in the input sequence after shifting it to the right by one pixel.
* Overlap the two objects by placing the pixels of Object 2 after the pixels of Object 1 in the input sequence.

Step 7: Remove Object 3 (input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

* Find the starting index of Object 3 (color = 4) in the input sequence.
* Remove the pixels from the starting index to the ending index of Object 3 in the input sequence.

Step 8: Repeat steps 1-7 for each input sequence (output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

By repeating these steps for each input sequence, we can transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
