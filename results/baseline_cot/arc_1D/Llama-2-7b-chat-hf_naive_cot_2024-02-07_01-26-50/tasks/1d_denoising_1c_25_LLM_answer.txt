You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.

The transformation from input to output follows a simple pattern:

* All objects are moved one position to the right in the output sequence.
* If an object overlaps with another object at the next position, they are merged into a single larger object.
* If an object reaches the end of the sequence without merging with any other object, it becomes a noise pixel.

Here are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through the input sequence, starting from the first element.
3. For each element in the input sequence, perform the following steps:
a. Check if the current element is part of an existing object. If it is, merge it with the existing object.
b. Otherwise, create a new object of size 1 and assign it the current element.
c. Move the object to the next position in the output sequence.
4. Repeat step 3 until the end of the input sequence is reached.
5. Add noise pixels to the end of the output sequence according to the following rule: if the last element in the input sequence is not part of an existing object, it becomes a noise pixel in the output sequence.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is to move objects one position to the right in the output sequence, merge objects that overlap, and add noise pixels at the end of the sequence.

**Transformation**

Here are the detailed transformation steps for each element in the input sequence:

1. Input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
2. Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:

* Step 1: Move the first object (size = 2) to the next position in the output sequence. Since there is no object at the next position, we create a new object of size 1 and assign it the value 8.
* Step 2: Merge the second object (size = 2) with the third object (size = 2) since they overlap at the next position. The result is a new object of size 4.
* Step 3: Move the fourth object (size = 2) to the next position. Since there is already an object at the next position, we merge the two objects. The result is a new object of size 4.
* Step 4: Move the fifth object (size = 2) to the next position. Since there is already an object at the next position, we merge the two objects. The result is a new object of size 4.
