You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.

To begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Example_1:
Input: `[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

From the output, we can see that the objects in the input sequence have been transformed by scaling them up by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions. Specifically, the object at index 1 in the input sequence has been transformed into two identical copies of itself, placed one above the other. Similarly, the object at index 3 in the input sequence has been transformed into three identical copies of itself, placed one after the other.

Example_2:
Input: `[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

In this case, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed by moving them horizontally by one pixel. Specifically, the object at index 1 in the input sequence has been moved to the left by one pixel, while the object at index 3 has been moved to the right by one pixel.

Example_3:
Input: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

In this case, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed by scaling them up by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions, just like in Example_1. However, unlike in Example_1, there are no overlapping objects in this sequence, so the transformation does not involve any merging or splitting of objects.

Now, let's apply these insights to the given test case:

Input: `[0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Based on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can expect the output sequence to have the following properties:

* The objects in the input sequence will be transformed by scaling them up by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.
* There may be some overlap between the objects in the output sequence, depending on their positions and sizes.

Therefore, to transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we can perform the following steps:

1. Scale each object in the input sequence up by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.
2. Check for any overlaps between the scaled objects and adjust their positions accordingly.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there are no more overlaps between the objects.

Here's the detailed transformation process for the given test case:

Step 1: Scale each object in the input sequence up by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.

Input: `[0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Output: `[0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Step 2: Check for any overlaps between the scaled objects and adjust their positions accordingly.

Input: `[0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Output: `[0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (no overlap)

Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there are no more overlaps between the objects.

Input: `[0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Output: `[0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (no overlap)

And that's it! By applying the transformation pattern observed in the given examples, we can successfully transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
