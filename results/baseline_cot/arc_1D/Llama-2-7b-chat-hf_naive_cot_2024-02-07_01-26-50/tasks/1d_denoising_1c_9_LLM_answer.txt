[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

Example_1:
Input: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

From this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 3, while the output sequence consists of only 0's and 3's. Moreover, there are no gaps between the adjacent values in both the input and output sequences.

Example_2:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 1, while the output sequence consists of only 0's and 1's. Again, there are no gaps between the adjacent values in both the input and output sequences.

Example_3:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 2, while the output sequence consists of only 0's and 2's. Once again, there are no gaps between the adjacent values in both the input and output sequences.

Now, based on these observations, I will make an educated guess about the simplest possible relation between input and output. My hypothesis is that the input sequence can be transformed into the output sequence by simply replacing each value with the next value in a cyclical rotation (i.e., wrapping around) of the input sequence. In other words, if the input sequence consists of n values, then the output sequence will consist of the same n values, but with each value shifted by one position in the cycle.

To test my hypothesis, I will apply it to a new input sequence. Here is the input sequence given in the problem statement:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]

Using my hypothesis, I will transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]

As you can see, the output sequence consists of the same values as the input sequence, but with each value shifted by one position in the cycle. This confirms our hypothesis!

Finally, I will provide the necessary transformation actions to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Given any input sequence, the transformation actions are as follows:

1. Replace each value in the input sequence with the next value in a cyclical rotation of the input sequence.
2. If the resulting output sequence contains any duplicates, remove them.

With these transformation actions, you can easily transform any input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the simple relation between input and output observed in the given examples.
