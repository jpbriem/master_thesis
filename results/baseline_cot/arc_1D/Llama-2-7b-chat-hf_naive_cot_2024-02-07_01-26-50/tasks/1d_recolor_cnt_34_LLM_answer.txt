You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Additionally, there are noise pixels that need to be taken into account.

To begin with, let's analyze the input sequence provided in the test case:
```json
[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
```
From the given output pairs, we can observe that the output sequence has the following properties:

* Each object (represented by a contiguous sequence of identical colors) has been moved one position to the right compared to the input sequence.
* The size of each object remains unchanged.
* The color of each object has been recolored according to a specific rule: if an object has a color that is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2), its color is replaced by the next even number after the original color (modulo 2).

Now, let's infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences. Based on the observed patterns, we can propose the following transformation rules:

1. Move each object one position to the right in the output sequence relative to the input sequence.
2. If an object has a color that is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2), replace its color with the next even number after the original color (modulo 2).

Using these rules, we can transform the input sequence as follows:
```json
[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
```
Transformed output sequence:
```json
[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]
```
As you can see, the objects in the output sequence have been moved one position to the right compared to the input sequence, and their colors have been recolored according to the specified rule.

In summary, the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is to apply the following transformation rules:

1. Move each object one position to the right in the output sequence relative to the input sequence.
2. If an object has a color that is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2), replace its color with the next even number after the original color (modulo 2).

I hope this helps you understand the transformation pattern involved in this problem! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to elaborate on any aspect of the solution.
