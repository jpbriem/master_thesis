The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also consists of 10 elements. The differences between the input and output sequences are:\n\t+ Elements 1 and 2 in the input sequence become element 1 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 3 and 4 in the input sequence become element 2 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 5 and 6 in the input sequence become element 3 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 7 and 8 in the input sequence become element 4 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 9 and 10 in the input sequence become element 5 in the output sequence.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 11 elements, and the output sequence also consists of 11 elements. The differences between the input and output sequences are:\n\t+ Elements 1 and 2 in the input sequence become element 1 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 3 and 4 in the input sequence become element 2 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 5 and 6 in the input sequence become element 3 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 7 and 8 in the input sequence become element 4 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 9 and 10 in the input sequence become element 5 in the output sequence.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also consists of 10 elements. The differences between the input and output sequences are:\n\t+ Elements 1 and 2 in the input sequence become element 1 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 3 and 4 in the input sequence become element 2 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 5 and 6 in the input sequence become element 3 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 7 and 8 in the input sequence become element 4 in the output sequence.\n\t+ Elements 9 and 10 in the input sequence become element 5 in the output sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple shift operation, where each element in the input sequence is shifted by one index position towards the right. This means that the i-th element in the input sequence becomes the (i+1)-th element in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to the test input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n\nTransformed output sequence: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the transformed output sequence is identical to the input sequence, but with each element shifted by one index position towards the right.\n\nTherefore, my answer to the question \"What is the simplest possible relation between input and output?\" is:\n\n\"The simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple shift operation, where each element in the input sequence is shifted by one index position towards the right.\""
