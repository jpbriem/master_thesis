You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In each input sequence, there are several groups of pixels that have the same color. These groups can be considered as objects. In the given input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], there are three objects:

Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}
Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 2}
Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 10, size: 1}

Step 2: Apply transformations to the objects

Based on the given transformation pattern, we need to apply the following transformations to each object:

* Move the objects one position to the right (i.e., shift them by one pixel).
* If an object overlaps with another object, remove the smaller object.
* Scale the larger object by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.
* Copy the remaining object and paste it after the original object.

Using these transformations, we can update the positions and sizes of the objects in the input sequence. For example, Object 1 becomes {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3}, Object 2 becomes {color: 7, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}, and Object 3 remains unchanged.

Step 3: Update the output sequence

After applying the transformations to the objects, we need to update the output sequence accordingly. Since the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, we can simply copy the input sequence without any modifications. Therefore, the output sequence for the given input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0] is [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0].

Overall Pattern:

Based on the given input-output pairs, the overall pattern of the transformation appears to be:

* Shift the objects one position to the right.
* Remove any overlapping objects.
* Scale the larger object by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.
* Copy the remaining object and paste it after the original object.

These steps can be applied recursively to transform any input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.
