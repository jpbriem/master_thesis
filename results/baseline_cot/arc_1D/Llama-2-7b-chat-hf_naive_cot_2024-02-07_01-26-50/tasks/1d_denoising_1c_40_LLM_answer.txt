You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel value (0-8) or a noise pixel (9). The objects in the input sequence are represented by their size, position, and color. The transformation pattern involves moving, scaling, and aligning objects, as well as removing and copying them. The noise pixels are also taken into account during the transformation process.

To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply a series of operations based on the logical rules provided in the problem statement. These operations include moving objects, scaling them up or down, aligning them horizontally or vertically, removing objects that overlap with other objects, copying objects without changing their position or size, and recoloring objects.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:

Step 1: Move all objects to the left by one pixel. This is because the input sequence starts with four zeros, indicating that there are no objects at positions 0-3. By moving all objects to the left, we ensure that they are aligned properly with the input sequence.

Step 2: Scale all objects up by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions. This is because the input sequence has a total of 8 objects, and we want to make sure that they are all visible in the output sequence. By scaling them up, we increase their size and make them more prominent in the output sequence.

Step 3: Align the objects horizontally so that they are evenly spaced apart. To do this, we compare the position of each object in the input sequence to its neighboring objects and adjust its position accordingly. We want to make sure that each object is separated from its neighbors by exactly one pixel.

Step 4: Remove any objects that overlap with other objects. To do this, we compare the position and size of each object in the input sequence to those of its neighboring objects, and if they overlap, we remove the overlapping object. This ensures that the output sequence does not contain any redundant or unnecessary objects.

Step 5: Copy the remaining objects without changing their position or size. This is because we want to preserve the original layout of the objects in the input sequence. By copying them without changing their position or size, we ensure that they are still aligned properly in the output sequence.

Step 6: Recolor some of the objects to create visual interest. In particular, we change the color of two of the objects to red and blue, respectively. This adds some variety to the output sequence and makes it more visually appealing.

And that's it! By applying these steps to the given input sequence, we obtain the corresponding output sequence shown above.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is to move, scale, align, remove, copy, and recolor objects in the input sequence. These operations are based on the logical rules provided in the problem statement, which involve comparing the position, size, and color of objects in the input sequence and making appropriate changes to produce the desired output sequence.

**Transformation**

Here's how we can transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:

Input: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

1. Move all objects to the left by one pixel: `[[0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 4]]`
2. Scale all objects up by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions: `[[2, 2, 2, 8], [2, 2, 2, 8], [2, 2, 2, 8], [2, 2, 2, 8]]`
3. Align the objects horizontally so that they are evenly spaced apart: `[[2, 4, 6, 8], [4, 6, 8, 10], [6, 8, 10, 12], [8, 10, 12, 14]]`
4. Remove any objects that overlap with other objects: `[[2, 4, 6, 8], [4, 6, 8, 10], [6, 8, 10, 12], [8, 10, 12, 14]]`
5. Copy the remaining objects without changing their position or size: `[[2, 4, 6, 8], [4, 6, 8, 10], [6, 8, 10, 12], [8, 10, 12, 14]]`
6. Recolor some of the objects to create visual interest: `[[2, 4, 6, 8], [4, 6, RED, 10], [6, 8, BLUE, 12], [8, 10, 12, 14]]`

Note that the resulting output sequence has a length of 16, which is twice the length of the input sequence. This is because we scaled up all objects by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, which resulted in twice as many objects in the output sequence.
