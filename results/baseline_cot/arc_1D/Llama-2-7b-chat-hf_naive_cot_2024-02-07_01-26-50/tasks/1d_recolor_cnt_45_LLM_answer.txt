You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the given examples:

Example 1:
Input: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

From this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are grouped together based on their color. The objects are also aligned horizontally. In the output sequence, each object is represented by a single pixel of its respective color. The objects are no longer aligned horizontally, but they are still distinguishable based on their color.

Example 2:
Input: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

In this example, the objects in the input sequence are again grouped together based on their color. However, there is one additional rule applied to the output sequence - any two adjacent pixels of the same color must be separated by at least one pixel of another color. This rule is evident in the output sequence, where each object is represented by a contiguous block of pixels of its respective color.

Now, let me apply these insights to the given test case:

Input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Based on the patterns observed in the previous examples, I will transform the input sequence as follows:

Output: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Here's how I arrived at this output:

* Group the objects in the input sequence based on their color. There are three objects in total - blue, green, and red.
* Each object is represented by a contiguous block of pixels of its respective color.
* Any two adjacent pixels of the same color must be separated by at least one pixel of another color. Applying this rule, I separated the blue and green objects from each other.
* The remaining pixels are white (i.e., color 0).

Therefore, the transformed output sequence has three distinct objects - blue, green, and red - each represented by a contiguous block of pixels of its respective color.

Finally, here is the JSON representation of the transformation steps:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. What changed HOW?",
        "Example_2": "..."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Transform input sequence by grouping objects based on their color, separating them by at least one pixel of another color.",
    "instructions": "Transform a new input sequence by applying the above pattern. Think step by step.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[copy the test case input sequence from the task]",
        "object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.",
        "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.",
        "output": "Create the resulting test output sequence."
    },
    "test_output": "[create the resulting test output sequence]"
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
