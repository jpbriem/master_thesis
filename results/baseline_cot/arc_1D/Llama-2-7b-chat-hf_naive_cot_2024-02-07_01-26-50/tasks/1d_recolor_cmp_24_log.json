The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2\n\nIn the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 0), we need to move Object 1 to position 2.\n\nStep 2: Scale Object 2 by a Factor of 2\n\nObject 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. We need to scale Object 2 by a factor of 2, so we multiply each value in Object 2 by 2.\n\nStep 3: Remove Object 3\n\nObject 3 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8. Since the starting index of Object 3 is greater than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 0), we can safely remove Object 3 from the input sequence.\n\nStep 4: Recolor Object 1\n\nObject 1 has a color of 9. Since the color of Object 1 is different from the color of the background (which is 0), we need to recolor Object 1 to match the background color. We set the color of Object 1 to 0.\n\nStep 5: Copy Object 1\n\nSince Object 1 has been moved to position 2 and recolored to match the background color, we need to copy Object 1 to a new location at position 0.\n\nStep 6: Sort the Remaining Objects\n\nAfter applying steps 1-5, there are three remaining objects in the input sequence: Object 2, Object 4, and Object 7. We sort these objects based on their starting indices, with Object 2 having the smallest starting index and Object 7 having the largest starting index.\n\nStep 7: Apply Relationships Between Objects\n\nBased on the relationships between the objects, we apply the following operations:\n\n* Object 2 and Object 4 overlap, so we merge them into a single object with a size of 6.\n* Object 7 is contained within Object 4, so we remove Object 7 and add its values to Object 4.\n\nStep 8: Transform the Output Sequence\n\nFinally, we transform the output sequence by applying the same operations as in steps 1-7 to the original input sequence. This gives us the desired output sequence.\n\nHere's the complete transformation process in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"Move Object 1 to position 2, scale Object 2 by a factor of 2, remove Object 3, recolor Object 1, copy Object 1, sort the remaining objects, and apply relationships between objects.\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"Move Object 1 to position 2, scale Object 2 by a factor of 2, remove Object 3, recolor Object 1, copy Object 1, sort the remaining objects, and apply relationships between objects.\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"move, scale, remove, recolor, copy, sort, and apply relationships\",\n  \"instructions\": \"Transform the input sequence by applying the above operations in the correct order. Think step by step!\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9]\"\n  },\n  \"test_output\": \"[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9]\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!
