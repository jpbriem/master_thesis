The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are grouped together and their sizes are consistent throughout the sequence. Moreover, there seems to be a pattern where each object is either moved one position to the right or left, or its size changes by a factor of 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n\nIn this example, we can see that the objects in the input sequence are also grouped together, but their positions seem to be randomized compared to the previous example. Additionally, there appears to be a scaling effect where each object is multiplied by a factor of 2 in size.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nIn this final example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are again grouped together, but now they seem to be aligned horizontally. Furthermore, there appears to be a rotation effect where each object is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nNow, based on these observations, I will attempt to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and their respective positions, sizes, and colors.\n\nStep 2: Apply the observed transformations (e.g., moving, scaling, rotating) to each object in the input sequence.\n\nStep 3: Ensure that the resulting output sequence has the correct number of objects and that each object has the appropriate size, position, and color.\n\nHere's an example of how I would apply these steps to a new input sequence:\n\nSuppose the input sequence is:\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nStep 1: Identifying objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 4}\n* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 8, end_index: 12, size: 4}\n* Object 3: {color: 4, start_index: 16, end_index: 20, size: 4}\n\nStep 2: Applying transformations to each object:\n\nObject 1: Move right by 2 positions, scale up by a factor of 2 in size.\nObject 2: Rotate clockwise by 90 degrees, move down by 2 positions, scale up by a factor of 2 in size.\nObject 3: Rotate counterclockwise by 90 degrees, move left by 2 positions, scale down by a factor of 2 in size.\n\nStep 3: Ensuring the resulting output sequence has the correct number of objects and properties:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n\nAs expected, the resulting output sequence has the same number of objects as the input sequence (i.e., 3), and each object has the appropriate size, position, and color based on the transformations applied in Step 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I believe the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a series of transformations that involve moving, scaling, rotating, and aligning objects in a grid-like structure."
