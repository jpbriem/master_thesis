The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem! Here's my answer:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel value ranging from 1 to 9, with 0 representing the background color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties (such as size, position, and color) can be accessed through the `Object` description field.\n\nThe transformation pattern between the input and output sequences appears to be based on the following rules:\n\n* Move an object by a fixed number of positions (either left or right).\n* Remove an object at a specific position.\n* Scale an object by a factor (either multiplying or dividing its size).\n* Copy an object without changing its properties.\n* Recolor an object by replacing some of its pixels with other colors.\n\nThese rules can be applied repeatedly to create complex patterns in the output sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nBased on the provided examples, it seems that the overall pattern of the transformation is to apply a series of operations to the input sequence, where each operation either moves or removes an object, scales another object, copies an object without changing its properties, or recolors an object. These operations are applied repeatedly until the output sequence is generated.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Apply the transformation rules to each object in the input sequence, using the appropriate operation (move, remove, scale, copy, recolor) depending on the object's properties and the current state of the output sequence.\n3. Repeat step 2 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.\n4. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo perform the transformation, you will need to access the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate operations to them. Here are the details of how to do this:\n\n* **Object Description**: Access the properties of each object in the input sequence, including its size, position, and color. You can use the `Object` description field to store these properties.\n* **Transformed Objects**: Based on the transformation rules, determine how each object should be transformed in the output sequence. This may involve moving or removing an object, scaling another object, copying an object without changing its properties, or recoloring an object. Store the transformed objects in the `TransformedObjects` field.\n* **Output Sequence**: Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, and populate it with the transformed objects. Use the `Output` field to store the resulting output sequence.\n\nFor example, given the input sequence `[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]`, you would apply the transformation rules as follows:\n\n1. Object 1: Move object 1 one position to the right, so it becomes `[5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]`.\n2. Object 2: Remove object 2, leaving `[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]`.\n3. Object 3: Scale object 3 by a factor of 2, so it becomes `[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 0]`.\n4. Object 4: Copy object 4 without changing its properties, so it remains `[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]`.\n5. Object 5: Recolor object 5 by replacing some of its pixels with other colors, but keep its size and position unchanged. Let's say we replace half of its pixels with the color 7. So, the transformed object becomes `[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0]`.\n\nFinally, the resulting output sequence would be `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9, 0]`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
