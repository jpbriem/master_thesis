[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Additionally, there are noise pixels that need to be handled.

To begin with, let's analyze the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0].

From the given output sequence, we can see that the following changes were applied to the input sequence:

* Objects were moved: Object_1 was moved two positions to the right, while Object_2 was moved one position to the left.
* Objects were scaled: Object_1 was scaled up by a factor of 2, while Object_2 was scaled down by a factor of 1/2.
* Objects were removed: Object_1 was removed after position 6, while Object_2 was removed after position 8.
* Objects were recolored: Object_1 was recolored from 5 to 0, while Object_2 was recolored from 5 to 1.

Now, let's consider how these operations could be performed step by step to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Here's one possible approach:

Step 1: Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.

Step 2: Iterate through each element in the input sequence, starting from the first element.

Step 3a: If the current element is a noise pixel (i.e., it has a value of 0), skip this iteration and proceed to the next element.

Step 3b: Otherwise, apply the necessary operation to the current object (if any) based on the logical rules provided earlier. For example, if the current element represents an object that needs to be moved, shift the entire object by the appropriate amount. If the current element represents an object that needs to be scaled, multiply its value by the appropriate scaling factor. If the current element represents an object that needs to be removed, set its value to 0. And so on.

Step 4: Add the modified element to the output sequence at the corresponding position.

Step 5: Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the input sequence is reached.

Finally, return the resulting output sequence as the solution to the problem.

Of course, this is just one possible approach, and there may be other ways to solve the problem depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem statement.
