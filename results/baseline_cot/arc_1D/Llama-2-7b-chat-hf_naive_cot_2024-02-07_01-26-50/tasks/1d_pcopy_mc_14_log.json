The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. All elements in the input sequence are either 0 or 8, except for one element that is 9. Similarly, all elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 8, except for one element that is 9. It seems that there is no transformation happening between adjacent elements in the input sequence, but there is some sort of grouping or clustering happening where all elements that are not 0 form a single object.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 11 elements, and the output sequence also has 11 elements. All elements in the input sequence are either 0 or 5, except for two elements that are 1. It appears that there is some sort of shift or movement happening between adjacent elements in the input sequence, where elements change their positions by one index.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. All elements in the input sequence are either 0 or 4, except for one element that is 5. There doesn't seem to be any transformation happening between adjacent elements in the input sequence, but there is some sort of counting or sorting happening where all elements that are not 0 are grouped together.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple shift or movement of elements in the input sequence, possibly accompanied by some sort of grouping or clustering of non-zero elements.\n\nNow, let me apply this reasoning to the test input sequence provided:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom the analysis above, it seems likely that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a simple shift or movement of elements in the input sequence. Specifically, it seems that all elements in the input sequence that are not 0 are shifted one index to the right, while maintaining their original value. This would result in the following output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that this transformation does not affect the overall length of the input or output sequences, and all elements in the output sequence have values from 0 to 9 (inclusive).\n\nTherefore, my answer to the question \"What transformation should be applied to the input sequence to obtain the output sequence?\" is:\n\n\"A simple shift or movement of elements in the input sequence, where all elements that are not 0 are shifted one index to the right, while maintaining their original value.\""
