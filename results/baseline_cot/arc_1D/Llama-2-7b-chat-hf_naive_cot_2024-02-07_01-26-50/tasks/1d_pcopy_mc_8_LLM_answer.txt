[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, rotating, and merging objects.

To solve this problem, we need to find the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences, and then apply the necessary transformations to transform the input sequence into the output sequence.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:

1. Move the objects in the input sequence horizontally by one pixel.
2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions.
3. Rotate the objects in the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise.
4. Merge any two adjacent objects in the input sequence if they have the same color.
5. Remove any object in the input sequence that has no neighboring objects of the same color.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Copy the input sequence as it is.
2. Apply the moves specified in step 1 to shift the objects in the input sequence horizontally by one pixel.
3. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions using linear interpolation.
4. Rotate the objects in the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise using linear interpolation.
5. Merge any two adjacent objects in the input sequence if they have the same color using linear interpolation.
6. Remove any object in the input sequence that has no neighboring objects of the same color using linear interpolation.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence.
8. Return the resulting output sequence.

**Transformation**

Here's how the transformation should be applied to the input sequence:

* **Input:** `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
* **Move horizontally by one pixel:** Shift the objects in the input sequence by one pixel to the right.
```markdown
[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
* **Scale by a factor of 2 in both directions:** Double the size of each object in the input sequence along both the x and y axes using linear interpolation.
```markdown
[0, 0, 14, 14, 14, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
* **Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise:** Rotate the objects in the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise using linear interpolation.
```markdown
[0, 0, 14, 14, 14, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
* **Merge adjacent objects of the same color:** Merge any two adjacent objects in the input sequence if they have the same color using linear interpolation.
```markdown
[0, 0, 14, 14, 14, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
* **Remove objects without neighboring objects of the same color:** Remove any object in the input sequence that has no neighboring objects of the same color using linear interpolation.
```markdown
[0, 0, 14, 14, 14, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
* **Repeat steps 2-6:** Repeat steps 2-6 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence.
```markdown
[0, 0, 14, 14, 14, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
* **Output:** The resulting output sequence.
```markdown
[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Therefore, the transformation rule for the given input sequence is:

`input -> output = [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
