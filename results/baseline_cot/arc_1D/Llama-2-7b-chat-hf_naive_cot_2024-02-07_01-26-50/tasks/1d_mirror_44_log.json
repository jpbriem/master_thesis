The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2\n\nIn the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 0), we need to move Object 1 to position 2.\n\nStep 2: Scale Object 2 by a Factor of 2\n\nObject 2 has a starting index of 3 and an ending index of 3. Since the factor used in the transformation pattern is 2, we need to scale Object 2 by a factor of 2, making its size twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 3: Remove Object 3\n\nObject 3 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. Since the removal operation is applied to Object 3, we need to remove it from the input sequence.\n\nStep 4: Recolor Object 1\n\nObject 1 has a color of 1, and we need to recolor it to a color of 9. We can achieve this by simply replacing each element of Object 1 with a new element that has a color of 9.\n\nStep 5: Move Object 4 to Position 8\n\nObject 4 has a starting index of 5 and an ending index of 5. Since the starting index of Object 4 is greater than the starting index of Object 1 (which is 1), we need to move Object 4 to position 8.\n\nStep 6: Scale Object 5 by a Factor of 2\n\nObject 5 has a starting index of 6 and an ending index of 6. Since the factor used in the transformation pattern is 2, we need to scale Object 5 by a factor of 2, making its size twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 7: Remove Object 6\n\nObject 6 has a starting index of 7 and an ending index of 7. Since the removal operation is applied to Object 6, we need to remove it from the input sequence.\n\nStep 8: Recolor Object 2\n\nObject 2 has a color of 3, and we need to recolor it to a color of 9. We can achieve this by simply replacing each element of Object 2 with a new element that has a color of 9.\n\nStep 9: Move Object 7 to Position 6\n\nObject 7 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8. Since the starting index of Object 7 is greater than the starting index of Object 6 (which is 5), we need to move Object 7 to position 6.\n\nStep 10: Scale Object 8 by a Factor of 2\n\nObject 8 has a starting index of 9 and an ending index of 9. Since the factor used in the transformation pattern is 2, we need to scale Object 8 by a factor of 2, making its size twice as large as it was originally.\n\nAnd there you have it! By following these steps, you can transform the input sequence into the output sequence.\n\nRegarding the overall pattern, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying a series of operations to the input sequence in a specific order, where each operation modifies the sequence in some way. The operations include moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. The order in which the operations are applied seems to matter, as some operations may depend on the results of previous operations."
