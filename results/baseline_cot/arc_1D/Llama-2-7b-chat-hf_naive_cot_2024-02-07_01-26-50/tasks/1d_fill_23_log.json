            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has one of nine possible values (0-8) representing different colors. The input and output sequences may also contain \"noise\" pixels that don't belong to any object.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Describe the difference between the input and output sequences for each example provided:\n\nInput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n* The main difference is that the output sequence has duplicate pixels, while the input sequence does not.\n\nInput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n* The main difference is that the output sequence has duplicate pixels, but the second half of the sequence is mirrored compared to the input sequence.\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n* The main difference is that the output sequence has duplicate pixels, and the last two pixels are swapped compared to the input sequence.\n\n1. Describe the objects in the input sequence:\n\nThe input sequence contains three objects:\n\nObject 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject 2: {color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\nObject 3: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\n1. Transform the input sequence into its output sequence:\n\nTo transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Duplicate the input sequence to create the output sequence.\nStep 2: Mirror the second half of the output sequence (starting from index 4) compared to the input sequence.\nStep 3: Swap the last two pixels of the output sequence (starting from index 6).\n\nHere's the transformed output sequence:\n\nTransformed output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n1. Return the transformed output sequence in numpy array format:\n\nThe transformed output sequence can be represented as a numpy array as follows:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\noutput = np.array([0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\nNote that the length of the output sequence is 8, which matches the length of the input sequence."
