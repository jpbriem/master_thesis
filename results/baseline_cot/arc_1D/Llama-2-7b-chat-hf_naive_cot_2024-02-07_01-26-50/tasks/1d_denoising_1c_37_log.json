The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are specified in the output sequence.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding consecutive pixels of the same color.\n2. Determine the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence.\n3. Create a new output sequence by replacing each object with a new pixel of the appropriate color and size, based on the position and color of the object in the input sequence.\n\nHere's an example of how these steps would work for the given input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are three objects:\n\nObject 1: {color: 3, start index: 0, end index: 3, size: 3}\nObject 2: {color: 3, start index: 6, end index: 9, size: 3}\nObject 3: {color: 3, start index: 12, end index: 15, size: 3}\n\nStep 2: Determine the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence. Based on the positions and sizes of the objects in the input sequence, we can determine their corresponding positions and sizes in the output sequence:\n\nObject 1: Position: [0, 3], Size: 3, Color: 3\nObject 2: Position: [6, 9], Size: 3, Color: 3\nObject 3: Position: [12, 15], Size: 3, Color: 3\n\nStep 3: Create the output sequence by replacing each object with a new pixel of the appropriate color and size, based on the position and color of the object in the input sequence. Here's the resulting output sequence:\n\nOutput sequence: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nAs you can see, the output sequence has the same structure as the input sequence, but with new pixels assigned to each object based on its size, position, and color in the input sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nBased on the examples provided, it appears that the overall pattern for transforming the input sequence into the output sequence involves identifying objects in the input sequence, determining their size, position, and color, and then creating a new output sequence by replacing each object with a new pixel of the appropriate color and size. This process can be repeated for any number of input sequences, with the resulting output sequences having the same overall structure but with new pixels assigned to each object based on its size, position, and color in the input sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding consecutive pixels of the same color.\n2. Determine the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence.\n3. Create a new output sequence by replacing each object with a new pixel of the appropriate color and size, based on the position and color of the object in the input sequence.\n\nHere's an example of how these steps would work for a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nBy applying these steps, we can transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence:\n\nOutput sequence: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
