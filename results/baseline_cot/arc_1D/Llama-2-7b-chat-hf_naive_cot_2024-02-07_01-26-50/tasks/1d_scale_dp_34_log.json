The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to position 2.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 is located at index 1, while in the output sequence, it is located at index 2. To achieve this, we simply shift the entire input sequence one position to the right. So, the updated input sequence would be:\n\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nStep 2: Scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 2 has a size of 2, so we need to double its size in both dimensions. We can do this by multiplying each element of the object by a factor of 2. So, the updated object 2 would look like this:\n\n[0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nStep 3: Remove object 3.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 3 is located at index 4, but since it is not present in the output sequence, we simply delete that index. So, the updated input sequence would be:\n\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nStep 4: Recolor object 1 to red (value 3).\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 has a color value of 0, but in the output sequence, it has a color value of 3. To achieve this, we simply replace each element of the object with the corresponding element of the red color palette (values 3-9). So, the updated object 1 would look like this:\n\n[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nStep 5: Move object 4 to position 7.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 4 is located at index 5, while in the output sequence, it is located at index 7. To achieve this, we simply shift the entire input sequence seven positions to the right. So, the updated input sequence would be:\n\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nAnd that's it! By applying these five steps, we can transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence."
