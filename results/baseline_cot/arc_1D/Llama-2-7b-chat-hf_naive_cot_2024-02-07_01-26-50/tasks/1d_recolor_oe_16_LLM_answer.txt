You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

Example_1:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

From this example, we can observe that each object in the input sequence has a corresponding object in the output sequence, where the size and position of the objects remain the same. However, the color of some objects changes, and there are additional objects present in the output sequence that were not present in the input sequence.

Example_2:
Input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, we can see that the objects in the input sequence are aligned horizontally, and their sizes increase gradually from left to right. In the output sequence, the objects are also aligned horizontally, but their sizes are larger than those in the input sequence. Additionally, there are more objects present in the output sequence than in the input sequence.

Example_3:
Input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are randomly distributed, and their sizes are relatively small compared to the output sequence. In the output sequence, the objects are still randomly distributed, but their sizes are much larger than those in the input sequence.

Now, based on these observations, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. From the given examples, it seems that the most common operation performed on the objects in the input sequence is scaling, either horizontally or vertically. Additionally, there may be some random movement or rotation of the objects during the transformation process.

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I will follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.
Step 2: Scale each object in the input sequence by a factor determined by the noise pixels present in the input sequence.
Step 3: Randomly move each object in the output sequence to a new position based on the distance between the original position and the center of the object.
Step 4: Rotate each object in the output sequence by an angle determined by the noise pixels present in the input sequence.

Here's an example of how this transformation could be applied to a new input sequence:

Input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Transformed Output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, the objects in the input sequence have been scaled up and moved around randomly, while maintaining their original positions relative to each other. This transformation captures the general pattern observed in the given examples, where objects are scaled and moved randomly while maintaining their relationships with each other.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
