The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and the transformation rule appears to involve logical operations on the pixel values, such as moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, containing, counting, and comparing.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the input sequence:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence:\nObjects:\nObject 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n3. Determine the transformation rule(s):\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation rule involves applying logical operations to the pixel values in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, containing, counting, and comparing. Specifically, the rule appears to involve the following operations:\n* Move: Shift the object by one pixel to the right.\n* Scale: Increase the size of the object by half.\n* Align: Make sure the object is aligned with the next pixel value.\n* Overlap: Check if the current object overlaps with the next pixel value. If yes, merge them.\n* Contain: Check if the current object contains the next pixel value. If yes, remove the contained pixel value.\n* Counting: Count the number of occurrences of each color in the input sequence.\n* Comparing: Compare the color of the current pixel value with the color of the next pixel value. If they match, apply the corresponding operation.\n4. Apply the transformation rule(s) to the input sequence:\nUsing the determined transformation rule(s), apply the necessary operations to the input sequence to obtain the output sequence.\n\nHere's the result of applying the transformation rule(s) to the given input sequence:\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the output sequence may have a different length than the input sequence, depending on the specific transformation rule(s) applied. Also, the colors in the output sequence may not necessarily match the colors in the input sequence, as some colors may be merged or removed during the transformation process."
