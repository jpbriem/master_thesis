The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include size, position, and color. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, and aligning them. The noise pixels are also taken into account during the transformation process.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).\n2. Apply the necessary transformation operations to each object, taking into account their properties and the noise pixels.\n3. Repeat step 2 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:\n\n* Move the objects towards the center of the sequence.\n* Scale the objects down by a factor of 0.5.\n* Hollow out the objects, removing half of their size.\n* Copy the remaining object and shift it towards the center of the sequence.\n* Recolor the objects using a random color from the range [0, 8].\n* Align the objects horizontally and vertically.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and remove the first element (the background color).\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties.\n3. Apply the necessary transformation operations to each object, taking into account their properties and the noise pixels.\n4. Repeat step 3 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.\n5. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how to perform the transformation for the given input sequence:\n\n1. Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\t* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 2, end_index: 4, size: 2}\n\t* Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}\n3. Apply the transformation operations to each object:\n\t* Object 1: Move towards the center of the sequence (x = 3), scale down by 0.5 (size = 1.5), hollow out (size = 0.5), copy and shift towards the center (x = 4.5, y = 4.5), recolor with a random color from [0, 8] (color = 6).\n\t* Object 2: Move towards the center of the sequence (x = 10), scale down by 0.5 (size = 0.5), hollow out (size = 0), copy and shift towards the center (x = 10.5, y = 10.5), recolor with a random color from [0, 8] (color = 4).\n4. Repeat step 3 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.\n\nThe resulting output sequence is:\n```json\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the transformation pattern may vary depending on the specific input sequence provided."
