The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence according to certain rules. Here's what I observe:\n\n* In each input sequence, there are one or more objects (represented by non-zero values) that are adjacent to each other.\n* Each object has a specific color (represented by a number between 1 and 9).\n* The objects may change their size, position, or color through various transformation rules.\n\nTo understand the transformation pattern better, let's analyze each of the input-output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]`\n\nFrom the input sequence, we can identify three objects:\n\nObject 1: Color = 2, Size = 2, Position = [1, 2]\nObject 2: Color = 2, Size = 2, Position = [3, 4]\nObject 3: Color = 0, Size = 2, Position = [5, 6]\n\nIn the output sequence, these objects have undergone some changes:\n\nObject 1: Size = 8, Position = [7, 8]\nObject 2: Size = 8, Position = [9, 10]\nObject 3: Size = 0, Position = [11, 12]\n\nIt appears that the objects are being moved around and resized according to some rule. Specifically, each object moves either one or two positions towards the right, and its size increases by a factor of 2.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: `[0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nAgain, we can identify three objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: Color = 2, Size = 2, Position = [1, 2]\nObject 2: Color = 2, Size = 2, Position = [3, 4]\nObject 3: Color = 0, Size = 2, Position = [5, 6]\n\nIn the output sequence, these objects have undergone different transformations:\n\nObject 1: Size = 8, Position = [7, 8]\nObject 2: Size = 9, Position = [10, 11]\nObject 3: Size = 0, Position = [12, 13]\n\nIt seems that the objects are being resized and moved around according to some rule, but with different scaling factors and movement distances than in Example_1.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: `[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]`\nOutput: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nHere again, we can identify three objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: Color = 2, Size = 2, Position = [1, 2]\nObject 2: Color = 2, Size = 2, Position = [3, 4]\nObject 3: Color = 0, Size = 2, Position = [5, 6]\n\nIn the output sequence, these objects have undergone similar transformations as in Examples_1 and 2:\n\nObject 1: Size = 8, Position = [7, 8]\nObject 2: Size = 9, Position = [10, 11]\nObject 3: Size = 0, Position = [12, 13]\n\nOverall Pattern:\nBased on these three input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence according to the following rules:\n\n1. Move the objects one or two positions towards the right.\n2. Resize the objects by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n3. If an object overlaps with another object, remove the smaller object.\n\nThese rules seem to apply consistently across all three input-output pairs, so they could be used to transform any input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. However, please note that this is just an observation, and there may be additional rules or patterns at play here."
