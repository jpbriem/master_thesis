You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Understand the input sequence
The input sequence consists of 8 pixels, each with a value between 1 and 9, representing different pixel colors. There are also 2 zero-valued pixels at the beginning and end of the sequence.

Step 2: Identify objects in the input sequence
Using the provided examples, we can identify the objects in the input sequence as follows:

* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}
* Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}

These objects are adjacent to each other in the input sequence.

Step 3: Apply transformations to the input sequence
Based on the provided examples, we can apply the following transformations to the input sequence:

* Move Object 1 one pixel to the right (i.e., from index 3 to index 4).
* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 (i.e., increase its size from 2 to 4 pixels).
* Remove the two zero-valued pixels at the beginning and end of the sequence.

Here's how the transformed input sequence would look like:

Input sequence after transformations: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 4: Output the transformed sequence
To obtain the output sequence, we simply repeat the transformations applied to the input sequence. Here's the resulting output sequence:

Output sequence: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Note that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, but the positions and sizes of the objects have been altered according to the transformations applied.

Overall pattern:
The overall pattern of the transformation appears to involve applying a series of operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, removing, and recoloring objects. These operations are applied in a specific order, with some conditions being met before applying each operation.

Instructions:
To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the provided examples.
2. Apply the transformations listed above to the input sequence, in the specified order.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more transformations are left to apply.

Transformation:
To perform the transformation, you need to copy the test case input sequence from the task, mind the sequence length! Then, you should describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color. Next, you should explain how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color. Finally, create the resulting test output sequence and return it in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!
