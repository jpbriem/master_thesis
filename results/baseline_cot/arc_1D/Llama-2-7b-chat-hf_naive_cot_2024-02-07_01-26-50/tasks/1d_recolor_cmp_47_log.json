The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example 1: The input sequence consists of alternating 0s and 5s, while the output sequence has a repeating pattern of 0s and 8s. It seems that each object (represented by a sequence of consecutive identical values) in the input sequence is replaced by an equivalent-sized object in the output sequence.\n* Example 2: The input sequence consists of a single object (a sequence of 10 consecutive 0s) surrounded by a larger object (a sequence of 16 consecutive 0s). In the output sequence, the smaller object is preserved, while the larger object is split into two equal-sized objects.\n* Example 3: The input sequence consists of several small objects (sequences of 5 consecutive 0s) separated by larger objects (sequences of 5 consecutive 5s). In the output sequence, each small object is replaced by a larger object of the same color.\n\nBased on these observations, it appears that the transformation pattern involves replacing objects in the input sequence with equivalent-sized objects in the output sequence, while preserving the overall structure and color distribution.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence. There are three objects in total:\n\nObject 1: {start index: 0, end index: 3, size: 5}\nObject 2: {start index: 7, end index: 10, size: 3}\nObject 3: {start index: 13, end index: 16, size: 3}\n\nStep 2: Replace each object in the input sequence with an equivalent-sized object in the output sequence. Since there are no noise pixels in the input sequence, we can simply copy each object from the input sequence to the output sequence without any modifications.\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8]\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern involves replacing objects in the input sequence with equivalent-sized objects in the output sequence, while preserving their original positions and colors."
