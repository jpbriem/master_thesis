The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my answer:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel value ranging from 1 to 9 (representing different colors) and 0 (representing the background color). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include their starting index, ending index, and size.\n\nBased on the given examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and recoloring the objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels present in the input sequence that need to be handled.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we will need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (starting index, ending index, and size).\n2. Apply the necessary transformation operations to each object, taking into account its properties and the other objects in the sequence. This may involve moving an object to a different position, scaling it up or down, aligning it with another object, overlapping it with another object, or recoloring it.\n3. Repeat step 2 for each object in the input sequence until no more transformations are required.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation seems to be based on the concept of \"objects\" and their relationships with each other. Each object has a specific set of properties (starting index, ending index, and size), and these properties determine the transformation operation(s) that need to be applied to that object. The relationships between objects can also affect the transformation process, such as when two objects overlap or when one object is moved relative to another.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties.\n3. Apply the necessary transformation operations to each object, taking into account its properties and the other objects in the sequence.\n4. Repeat step 3 until no more transformations are required.\n5. Create the resulting test output sequence by filling in the appropriate values for each pixel position based on the transformed objects.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere are the detailed instructions for each transformation operation:\n\n* Move: Move an object to a new position based on a specified offset. For example, if the object is currently at position i, move it to position i + offset.\n* Hollow: Remove an object completely, leaving a gap in its former position.\n* Scale: Resize an object by a specified factor. For example, if an object is currently sized x, scale it up by a factor of y and place it at position i.\n* Align: Position an object so that it is aligned with another object. For example, if an object is currently at position i, align it with an object at position j.\n* Overlap: Allow two or more objects to overlap each other, with the smaller object(s) being removed. For example, if two objects are currently at positions i and j, allow them to overlap, but remove any portion of the smaller object that falls outside of the larger object.\n* Recolor: Change the color of an object to match a specified color. For example, if an object is currently colored red, change its color to blue.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nThe test output sequence will consist of the transformed objects in the correct positions, with their updated sizes and colors.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
