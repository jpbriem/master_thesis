You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has one of nine possible values (0-8) representing different colors. The input and output sequences also have zero-indexing, meaning that the first pixel in the input sequence corresponds to the first pixel in the output sequence, and so on.

To begin with, let's analyze the input and output sequences for the first pair of examples provided:

Input: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

From the input sequence, we can see that there are six distinct colors present: 4, 7, 7, 7, and 0. From the output sequence, we can observe that the colors have been transformed in the following way:

* All instances of 4 have been replaced by 7.
* All instances of 7 have been replaced by 7.
* All instances of 0 have been preserved unchanged.

Now, let's consider the second pair of examples:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, the input sequence contains five distinct colors: 0, 0, 0, 4, and 1. After applying the transformation, the output sequence looks like this:

* All instances of 0 have been preserved unchanged.
* All instances of 4 have been replaced by 1.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves replacing each instance of a color with another color that is one position ahead in the sequence. In other words, if a color appears at index i in the input sequence, it will appear at index i+1 in the output sequence.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the test case input sequence provided:

Input: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Using the above observation, we can predict the following output sequence:

* All instances of 0 have been preserved unchanged.
* All instances of 4 have been replaced by 6.

Therefore, the transformed output sequence would be:

[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Finally, let's provide the necessary transformation actions to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:

Transformation:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through the input sequence, starting from the first element.
3. If the current element is equal to 0, leave it unchanged in the output sequence.
4. Otherwise, replace the current element in the output sequence with the next element in the output sequence, shifted by one position.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the input sequence is reached.

And that's it! With these instructions, you should be able to transform any input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation pattern.
