You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

Example 1:
Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

From this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are grouped together based on their color. Specifically, there are three groups of objects:

* Group 1: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0] - These objects are colored either 0 or 7.
* Group 2: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0] - These objects are colored 7.
* Group 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - These objects are colored 0.

The transformation rule for this example is to move each object one position to the right (i.e., shift it by one index). This means that the objects in Group 1 will become the next group, followed by Group 2, and so on. As a result, the output sequence will have fewer objects than the input sequence because some of the objects have been moved out of the sequence.

Example 2:
Input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4]

In this example, the objects in the input sequence are again grouped based on their color. However, the grouping is slightly different than in Example 1. There are now four groups of objects:

* Group 1: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0] - These objects are colored either 0 or 7.
* Group 2: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0] - These objects are colored 7.
* Group 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - These objects are colored 0.
* Group 4: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] - These objects are colored 7 and are located at the end of the sequence.

The transformation rule for this example is to align the objects in each group vertically. Specifically, if there are n objects in a group, they will be aligned at positions (n-1), (n-2),..., 0. As a result, the output sequence will have more objects than the input sequence because some of the objects have been added to the end of the sequence.

Now, let's apply these transformation rules to a new input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the given transformation rules, we can transform this input sequence into the following output sequence:

Output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, the objects in the input sequence are grouped based on their color just like in Examples 1 and 2. The transformation rule for this example is to move each object one position to the right (i.e., shift it by one index) just like in Example 1. Therefore, the output sequence will have fewer objects than the input sequence because some of the objects have been moved out of the sequence.

I hope this helps you understand the transformation pattern better and solve the problem! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
