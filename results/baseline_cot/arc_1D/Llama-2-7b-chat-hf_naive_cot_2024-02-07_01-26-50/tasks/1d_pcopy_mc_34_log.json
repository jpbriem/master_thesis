The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, and the noise pixels have been shifted by one position to the right.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, in this case, each object has been aligned horizontally with the previous object, and the noise pixels have been shifted by one position to the left.\n* Example_3: This is the most complex input-output pair provided, where the input sequence consists of a mix of objects and noise pixels, with some objects overlapping with each other. In the output sequence, each object has been moved down by one position, and the noise pixels have been shifted by two positions to the right.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the size and position of the objects in the input sequence, while maintaining their color information. Additionally, there may be some shifting or aligning of the objects and noise pixels in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Suppose we have an input sequence `x` of length `N`, where each element `x[i]` represents a pixel value between 0 and 9. Our goal is to transform `x` into an output sequence `y` of the same length, such that `y[i]` represents the corresponding pixel value after applying the transformation rule.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to transform `x`:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence `y` of length `N`.\n2. Iterate through each element `x[i]` in the input sequence `x`.\n3. If `x[i]` is greater than 0, meaning it represents an object in the input sequence, follow these steps:\na. Scale the object by a factor of 2 in both dimensions (i.e., double its size).\nb. Shift the object by one position to the right in the output sequence.\nc. Set the value of `y[i]` to the original color value of the object.\n4. Otherwise, if `x[i]` is equal to 0, meaning it represents a noise pixel in the input sequence, set the value of `y[i]` to a random value between 0 and 9, uniformly distributed.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each element `x[i]` in the input sequence `x`.\n\nBy applying this transformation rule, we should be able to generate an output sequence `y` that corresponds to the desired output sequence for the given input sequence `x`. Note that this approach assumes that the input sequence `x` contains only objects and noise pixels, without any additional features or patterns.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON response for the given input sequence `x`:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels.
