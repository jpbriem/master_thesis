The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, and recoloring the objects. The noise pixels are also taken into account during the transformation process.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence by one pixel to the right.\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 0.5 in both directions.\n3. Hollow out the objects in the input sequence by removing half of their size in both directions.\n4. Copy the remaining objects in the input sequence and paste them after the last object in the input sequence.\n5. Recolor the copied objects in the output sequence according to the following rule: if the color of the object in the input sequence is odd, then the color of the object in the output sequence is even; otherwise, the color of the object in the output sequence is odd.\n6. Remove any noise pixels in the input sequence.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation for each step:\n\nStep 1: Move the objects in the input sequence by one pixel to the right.\n\nIn the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, the objects are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color. After moving the objects to the right by one pixel, the new input sequence would be `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0]`.\n\nStep 2: Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 0.5 in both directions.\n\nAfter scaling the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 0.5 in both directions, the new input sequence would be `[0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5]`.\n\nStep 3: Hollow out the objects in the input sequence by removing half of their size in both directions.\n\nAfter hollowing out the objects in the input sequence, the new input sequence would be `[0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 0]`.\n\nStep 4: Copy the remaining objects in the input sequence and paste them after the last object in the input sequence.\n\nAfter copying the remaining objects in the input sequence, the new input sequence would be `[0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 3.5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.\n\nStep 5: Recolor the copied objects in the output sequence according to the following rule: if the color of the object in the input sequence is odd, then the color of the object in the output sequence is even; otherwise, the color of the object in the output sequence is odd.\n\nFor example, in the output sequence `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]`, the color of the second object is odd (4), so the color of the corresponding object in the output sequence is even (0). Similarly, the color of the fourth object is odd (4), so the color of the corresponding object in the output sequence is even (0).\n\nStep 6: Remove any noise pixels in the input sequence.\n\nNoise pixels are pixels that do not belong to any object in the input sequence. In the given input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, there are no noise pixels.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence would be `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]`."
