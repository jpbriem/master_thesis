The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences share a similar pattern, where each object (represented by a contiguous sequence of the same color) is transformed in a consistent manner. Specifically, the objects are either moved, resized, or rotated, while maintaining their relative positions and distances to each other.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the input and output sequences can be described as follows:\n\n* Each object in the input sequence is transformed according to a specific rule, depending on its color and position.\n* The transformation rules are applied recursively to each subsequence of adjacent pixels of the same color.\n* The resulting output sequence has the same number of objects as the input sequence, but with potentially different sizes, positions, and colors.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and position.\n2. Apply the appropriate transformation rule to each object, depending on its color and position.\n3. Recursively apply steps 1 and 2 to each subsequence of adjacent pixels of the same color.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more objects remain to be transformed.\n5. Sort the output sequence lexicographically based on the color of each object.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere are the transformation rules for each color class:\n\n* White (color = 0): No transformation.\n* Black (color = 9): Remove the entire object.\n* Red (color = 1): Move the object one position to the right.\n* Green (color = 2): Resize the object by a factor of 2 in both directions.\n* Blue (color = 3): Rotate the object by 90 degrees clockwise.\n* Yellow (color = 4): Scale the object by a factor of 2 in both directions, then rotate it by 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n* Magenta (color = 5): Move the object two positions to the left, then resize it by a factor of 2 in both directions.\n* Cyan (color = 6): Move the object one position to the left, then rotate it by 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n* Purple (color = 7): Resize the object by a factor of 2 in both directions, then move it one position to the right.\n* Pink (color = 8): Rotate the object by 90 degrees clockwise, then move it one position to the left.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nUsing the given input sequence, the resulting test output sequence would be:\n```json\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and the objects are arranged in the same relative positions and distances as in the input sequence."
