You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been reduced in size by half, and some noise pixels have been removed.
* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, in this case, some objects have been duplicated, while others have been removed or modified.
* Example_3: This is the most complex example so far, where the input sequence consists of a single large object surrounded by smaller objects. In the output sequence, some of these objects have been moved or resized.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the size and position of objects in the input sequence, as well as removing or duplicating them. Additionally, there may be some noise reduction or addition going on.

Now, let's apply these insights to transform a new input sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:
```markdown
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0]
```
To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: There are three large objects (represented by non-zero values) in the input sequence, each with a size of 7.
2. Modify the size and position of the objects: Each object in the input sequence should be reduced in size by half, similar to what happened in Example_1. So, the first object should be reduced to size 3, the second object to size 3, and the third object to size 3.
3. Remove some noise pixels: There are several noise pixels (represented by zero values) in the input sequence that do not belong to any object. We can remove these pixels to simplify the sequence.
4. Repeat the process: Apply steps 1-3 to the remaining parts of the input sequence until no more objects remain.

Here's the resulting output sequence:
```markdown
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]
```
As expected, the output sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, with some modification in size and position compared to the input sequence.

Therefore, the transformation rule for this problem can be summarized as follows:

Transformation Rule: Given an input sequence consisting of alternating objects and noise pixels, reduce the size and position of each object by half, remove some noise pixels, and repeat the process until no more objects remain. The resulting output sequence will consist of alternating objects and noise pixels, with some modification in size and position compared to the input sequence.
