The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of a series of identical elements (in this case, 0 or 2), separated by spaces. The output sequence also consists of identical elements, but with some elements shifted by one index compared to the input sequence. This suggests that the transformation rule is simply shifting each element in the input sequence by one index to obtain the corresponding element in the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 3, 4, 3, 8, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of a series of consecutive zeros and ones, separated by spaces. The output sequence also consists of consecutive zeros and ones, but with some elements shifted by one index compared to the input sequence. This suggests that the transformation rule is simply flipping each bit in the input sequence to obtain the corresponding bit in the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of a series of consecutive zeros and ones, separated by spaces. The output sequence also consists of consecutive zeros and ones, but with some elements shifted by one index compared to the input sequence. This suggests that the transformation rule is simply repeating each element in the input sequence by the number of times it appears in the input sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these transformation rules to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the transformation rules learned from the previous examples, we can transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence consists of the same elements as the input sequence, but with some elements shifted by one index compared to the input sequence. This confirms that the transformation rule is indeed applying the simple operations observed in the input-output pairs provided earlier.\n\nTherefore, based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a series of bitwise operations (either AND, OR, XOR, or NOT) applied to the input sequence, followed by a shift operation to align the output sequence with the input sequence."
