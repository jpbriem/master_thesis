The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to the second position.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 is located at index 1, while in the output sequence, it is located at index 2. To achieve this, we simply shift the entire input sequence one position to the right. So, the transformed input sequence would be:\n\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 2: Scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 2 has a size of 2 pixels in both dimensions. In the output sequence, object 2 has a size of 4 pixels in both dimensions. To achieve this, we simply multiply each element of object 2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. So, the transformed object 2 would be:\n\n[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 3: Remove object 3.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 3 is located at index 4. Since there is no object at this index in the output sequence, we simply delete the element at this index in the transformed input sequence. So, the transformed input sequence would be:\n\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 4: Recolor object 1 to red (color = 7).\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 has a color of blue (color = 2). In the output sequence, object 1 has a color of red (color = 7). To achieve this, we simply replace each element of object 1 with the corresponding element of the red color palette. So, the transformed object 1 would be:\n\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 5: Move object 4 to the third position.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 4 is located at index 5. In the output sequence, object 4 is located at index 3. To achieve this, we simply shift the entire transformed input sequence one position to the left. So, the transformed input sequence would be:\n\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd that's it! These are the steps required to transform the input sequence into the output sequence."
