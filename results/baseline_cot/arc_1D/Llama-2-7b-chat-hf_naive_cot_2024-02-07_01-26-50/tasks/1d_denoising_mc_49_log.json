The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 11 elements, and the output sequence consists of 11 elements as well. All elements in the input sequence are either 0 or 1, except for the last element which is 6. Similarly, all elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 1, except for the last element which is also 6. It seems that the transformation pattern involves replacing each element in the input sequence with the same element in the output sequence, without any modification.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 13 elements, and the output sequence consists of 13 elements as well. Similar to Example_1, all elements in the input sequence are either 0 or 1, except for the last element which is 0. In contrast, all elements in the output sequence are either 0 or 1, except for the last element which is also 0. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves replacing each element in the input sequence with the same element in the output sequence, but with a twist - the last element in the output sequence is always 0.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence consists of 10 elements as well. Unlike the previous two examples, the elements in the input sequence are not necessarily consecutive, and some elements may appear more than once. However, the output sequence still consists of 10 elements, and all elements are either 0 or 1. It appears that the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input sequence and converting each element to 0 or 1 without any modification.\n\nNow, let me apply these insights to the test case provided:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the analysis above, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is simply copying the input sequence and converting each element to 0 or 1 without any modification. Therefore, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that I have removed the last element (which was 0) since it is already present in the output sequence multiple times.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for the test case is:\n\nTransformation rule: Copy the input sequence and convert each element to 0 or 1 without any modification.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
