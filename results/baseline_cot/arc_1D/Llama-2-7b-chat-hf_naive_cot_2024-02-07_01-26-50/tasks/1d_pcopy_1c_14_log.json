The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a simple pattern:\n\n* All objects are moved one position to the right in the output sequence.\n* If an object overlaps with another object at the next position, they are merged into a single larger object.\n* If an object has no neighbor at the next position, it is removed from the output sequence.\n\nHere are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding adjacent pixels of the same color.\n3. Determine the size and position of each object in the input sequence.\n4. Move each object one position to the right in the output sequence.\n5. Merge any two objects that overlap at the next position.\n6. Remove any object that has no neighbor at the next position.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the entire input sequence has been processed.\n8. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to move all objects one position to the right in the output sequence, merge any two objects that overlap at the next position, and remove any object that has no neighbor at the next position. This pattern is repeated until the entire input sequence has been processed.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Copy the input sequence**: Copy the input sequence as it is, without making any changes.\n2. **Identify the objects**: Find adjacent pixels of the same color in the input sequence to identify the objects.\n3. **Determine the size and position**: Determine the size and position of each object in the input sequence.\n4. **Move the objects**: Move each object one position to the right in the output sequence.\n5. **Merge objects**: Merge any two objects that overlap at the next position.\n6. **Remove objects**: Remove any object that has no neighbor at the next position.\n7. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 4-6 until the entire input sequence has been processed.\n8. **Return the output**: Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nFor the given test cases, the output sequences are:\n\n* Input: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n* Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n* Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nI hope this helps!
