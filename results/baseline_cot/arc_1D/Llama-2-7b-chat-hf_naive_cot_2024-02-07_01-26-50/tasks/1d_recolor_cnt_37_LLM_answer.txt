You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 7, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In each input sequence, there are several distinct regions of the same color, which can be considered as objects. In the given input sequence [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], the objects are:

* Object 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}
* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}
* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1}

Step 2: Apply transformations to the objects

Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the transformations applied to the objects involve moving them, scaling them, and changing their color. Here are some possible transformation rules:

* Move an object by a fixed number of positions (either horizontally or vertically).
* Scale an object by a factor (e.g., multiplying its width or height by a constant value).
* Change the color of an object to a new value (e.g., replacing a blue object with a red object).

Using these rules, we can apply the following transformations to the objects in the input sequence:

* Object 1: Move it one position to the right.
* Object 2: Scale it by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double its size).
* Object 3: Change its color to green.

Step 3: Combine the transformed objects

After applying the transformations to the objects, we need to combine them in a way that produces the desired output sequence. One possibility is to simply concatenate the transformed objects along the horizontal axis, producing a longer sequence with more objects.

Here's what the transformed objects would look like after applying the above transformations:

Transformed Object 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}
Transformed Object 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}
Transformed Object 3: {color: 3, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1}

Step 4: Output the transformed sequence

Finally, we can output the transformed sequence by copying the resulting objects and placing them in the correct order to form the output sequence. Here's what the output sequence would look like for the given input sequence:

Output sequence: [0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0]

Note that this is just one possible solution to the problem, and there may be other ways to approach it depending on the specific requirements of the task.
