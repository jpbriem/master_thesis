prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Firstly, let me clarify that the given input-output pairs share the same underlying transformation pattern, which can be described as follows:

* Each object in the input sequence is transformed into itself in the output sequence, except when an object has a neighbor of the same color, in which case it is replaced by a copy of that neighbor.

Now, let's apply this transformation pattern to the given input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Object 1: Color = 1, Start index = 1, End index = 2, Size = 2
Object 2: Color = 1, Start index = 3, End index = 4, Size = 2

To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions. In this case, there are two objects: Object 1 (color = 1, start index = 1, end index = 2, size = 2) and Object 2 (color = 1, start index = 3, end index = 4, size = 2).

Step 2: Check the neighbors of each object in the input sequence. For Object 1, the neighbors are Object 2 and the background color (0). For Object 2, the neighbors are Object 1 and the background color (0).

Step 3: Replace each object in the input sequence with a copy of its neighbor if they have the same color. In other words, Object 1 is replaced by a copy of Object 2 since they have the same color (1). Similarly, Object 2 is replaced by a copy of Object 1 since they also have the same color (1).

Step 4: Update the positions of the remaining objects in the output sequence based on their new sizes. In this case, Object 1 now has a size of 2 instead of 2, and Object 2 now has a size of 1 instead of 2.

And here's the transformed output sequence:

Output sequence: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

As requested, I will provide the necessary transformation actions to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the above pattern. Please provide the new input sequence, and I will guide you through the transformation process step by step.
