            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom the output, we can see that each object in the input sequence has been duplicated once, resulting in a total of 8 objects in the output sequence. Additionally, the objects seem to be aligned horizontally in both the input and output sequences.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nSimilar to Example_1, each object in the input sequence has been duplicated once, resulting in a total of 8 objects in the output sequence. However, the objects in this example appear to be aligned vertically in both the input and output sequences.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: `[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nAgain, each object in the input sequence has been duplicated once, resulting in a total of 8 objects in the output sequence. This time, the objects seem to be randomly distributed across the sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to the given test case:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]`\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can expect the output sequence to have 8 objects, each with a size of 1 pixel. Since the input sequence contains a single object with a size of 7 pixels, we can assume that this object will be replicated 8 times in the output sequence. Therefore, the output sequence will likely look something like this:\n\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]`\n\nHowever, note that this is just a rough estimate, and the actual output sequence may vary depending on the specific transformation rules applied to the input sequence. To obtain the exact output sequence, we would need to carefully analyze the transformation pattern and apply it to the input sequence."
