            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the given input and output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom the output sequence, we can see that the objects in the input sequence have been moved two positions to the right. Specifically, object 1 has moved from index 1 to index 3, object 2 has moved from index 2 to index 5, and so on.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: `[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this case, the objects in the input sequence have been resized to half their original size. Specifically, object 1 has been resized to size 2, object 2 has been resized to size 2, and so on.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]`\n\nIn this case, the objects in the input sequence have been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to the given test case:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]`\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can expect the objects in the input sequence to be moved, resized, or rotated in some way. However, without additional information about the specific transformation rule(s) applicable to this test case, we cannot provide a definitive answer.\n\nTherefore, our suggested approach is to try out different transformation rules and observe the resulting output sequence. We will need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes, positions, and colors.\n2. Apply the identified transformation rules to the objects in the input sequence.\n3. Observe the resulting output sequence and compare it with the expected output.\n\nWe will update this answer with the actual transformation rule(s) and the resulting output sequence once we have tried them out."
