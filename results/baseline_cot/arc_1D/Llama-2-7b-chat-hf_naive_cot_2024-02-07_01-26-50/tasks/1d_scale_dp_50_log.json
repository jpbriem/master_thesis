The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], there are two objects:\n\nObject 1: {color: 5, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 2}\nObject 2: {color: 5, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object\n\nFor Object 1, we need to apply the following transformation rules:\n\n* Move 2 positions to the right (i.e., from index 4 to index 6)\n* Scale by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double the size in both x and y dimensions)\n* Remove the object at index 5 (since it overlaps with Object 1)\n\nAfter applying these rules, Object 1 will become:\n\n{color: 5, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 4}\n\nFor Object 2, we need to apply the following transformation rules:\n\n* Move 1 position to the left (i.e., from index 8 to index 7)\n* Scale by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double the size in both x and y dimensions)\n\nAfter applying these rules, Object 2 will become:\n\n{color: 5, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 2}\n\nStep 3: Combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence\n\nNow, we need to combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence. In this case, the output sequence will be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 0]\n\nNote that the order of the objects in the output sequence is the same as in the input sequence, but their sizes and positions have been modified according to the transformation rules applied earlier.\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this problem can be represented as follows:\n\nInput \u2192 Transformed Input \u2192 Output\n\nWhere the transformed input is obtained by applying the transformation rules to the original input sequence, and the output sequence is the combined result of the transformed objects."
