The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will infer the simplest possible relation between input and output and then transform a new input into its corresponding output.\n\nRelation Inference:\nAfter analyzing the input-output pairs provided, I believe the simplest possible relation between input and output is a series of bitwise operations, including AND, OR, and XOR. These operations can be applied element-wise across the input sequence to produce the output sequence.\n\nTransformation Algorithm:\nGiven an input sequence `x`, the transformation algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Apply a bitwise AND operation to each pair of adjacent elements in `x` to create a new sequence `y`. This will reduce the number of bits in each element by half.\n2. Apply a bitwise OR operation to each element in `y` to create a new sequence `z`. This will set the most significant bits to 1 if they were 0 before, and leave them unchanged otherwise.\n3. Apply a bitwise XOR operation to each element in `z` to create a new sequence `w`. This will flip the bits in each element if they were 0 before, and leave them unchanged otherwise.\n4. Concatenate the resulting sequences `w` to obtain the final output sequence `u`.\n\nExample Transformation:\nUsing the input sequence `[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and applying the transformation algorithm above, we get the output sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nNote that the transformation algorithm can be implemented efficiently using bitwise operations in NumPy or other libraries."
