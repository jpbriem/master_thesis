You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the given examples:

Example 1:
The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been reduced in size by one pixel, and some noise pixels have been removed.

Example 2:
The input sequence consists of a single large object surrounded by noise pixels. The output sequence consists of multiple smaller objects, each separated by at least one noise pixel.

Example 3:
The input sequence consists of several small objects scattered throughout the sequence, along with some noise pixels. The output sequence consists of a single large object surrounded by smaller objects, with some noise pixels remaining.

Based on these examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the size and shape of objects in the input sequence, while also removing or adding noise pixels. Additionally, there may be some conditionality involved, as some of the transformations seem to depend on the specific positions of the objects in the input sequence.

Now, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

From the given examples, we can see that the input sequence consists of several objects separated by noise pixels. To transform this sequence into its output equivalent, we need to modify the size and shape of the objects while also removing some noise pixels.

Here's my proposed transformation:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence:
	* Object 1: [0, 3, 3, 0], size = 3 pixels
	* Object 2: [3, 3, 3, 3], size = 3 pixels
	* Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0], size = 1 pixel
2. Modify the size and shape of the objects:
	* Object 1: reduce size by 1 pixel (to 2 pixels)
	* Object 2: reduce size by 1 pixel (to 2 pixels)
	* Object 3: remove (size becomes 0 pixels)
3. Remove some noise pixels:
	* Remove the middle two pixels of the input sequence (at indices 4 and 5)
4. Output the modified sequence:
	[0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Note that this transformation is just one possible way to map the input sequence to its output equivalent. There may be other valid transformations depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
