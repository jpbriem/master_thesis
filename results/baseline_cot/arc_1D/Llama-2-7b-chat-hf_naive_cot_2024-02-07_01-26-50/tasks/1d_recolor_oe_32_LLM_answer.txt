[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and background pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and background pixels, but with each object having a larger size than its counterpart in the input sequence. Specifically, each object in the output sequence has a size that is twice the size of its counterpart in the input sequence.
* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and background pixels. However, in this case, each object in the output sequence has a size that is four times the size of its counterpart in the input sequence.
* Example_3: This is similar to Example_1, but with smaller objects. Each object in the output sequence has a size that is half the size of its counterpart in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves scaling the objects in the output sequence relative to their counterparts in the input sequence. Specifically, the scale factor for each object is equal to two for Example_1, four for Example_2, and half for Example_3.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the test input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Transformed output sequence: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, we applied the transformation by scaling each object in the input sequence by a factor of two, resulting in larger objects in the output sequence.

Finally, here is the requested JSON data structure containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. Be precise and say what changed how!",
    "Example_2": "..."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs.",
  "instructions": "Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[copy the test case input sequence from the task]. Mind the sequence length!",
    "object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color.",
    "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.",
    "output": "Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!"
  },
  "test_output": "[return the created test output sequence in numpy array format]. Mind the sequence length!"
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
