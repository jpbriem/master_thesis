The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 11 elements, and the output sequence also has 11 elements. All elements in both sequences are either 0 or 4, indicating that there are two distinct colors present in the sequence.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of 11 elements, and the output sequence also has 11 elements. However, in this case, all elements are either 0 or 8, indicating that there are two distinct colors present in the sequence.\n* Example_3: This is the only example where the input sequence has an odd number of elements (9), while the output sequence has an even number of elements (10). Also, the values in the output sequence range from 0 to 4, indicating that there may be multiple colors present in the sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one mapping between each element in the input sequence and its corresponding element in the output sequence. In other words, each element in the input sequence is transformed into the exact same element in the output sequence, without any changes in value or position.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTransformed output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs we can see, the transformed output sequence is identical to the original input sequence, indicating that no transformation was applied.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"What is the simplest possible relation between input and output?\" is a one-to-one mapping between each element in the input sequence and its corresponding element in the output sequence."
