You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

Example 1:
Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0]`

From this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of zeros and ones, while the output sequence also consists of zeros and ones but with some objects (represented by non-zero elements) added to it. The objects in the output sequence seem to be larger than those in the input sequence.

Example 2:
Input: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]`

Similar to the previous example, the input sequence consists of zeros and ones, while the output sequence has objects added to it. However, in this example, the objects seem to be smaller than those in the previous example.

Example 3:
Input: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0]`

In this example, the input sequence consists of zeros and ones, while the output sequence again has objects added to it. However, unlike the previous two examples, the objects in this example seem to be identical and repeated multiple times throughout the sequence.

Now, based on these observations, I will attempt to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the following steps:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are no objects in the input sequence, so we will skip this step.

Step 2: Determine the size of each object in the output sequence. From the given examples, we can see that the size of each object seems to be equal to the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding output sequence. So, if the input sequence contains `n` non-zero elements, the output sequence will consist of `n` objects.

Step 3: Position each object in the output sequence. Since the objects in the output sequence seem to be larger than those in the input sequence, we will need to adjust their positions accordingly. Specifically, we will shift each object towards the right by `n` positions, where `n` is the number of non-zero elements in the input sequence.

Step 4: Color each object in the output sequence. Based on the given examples, it appears that each object in the output sequence has the same color (i.e., the color of the corresponding non-zero element in the input sequence). Therefore, we will simply assign the same color to each object in the output sequence.

Finally, we will repeat these steps until the entire input sequence has been transformed into its corresponding output sequence.

With these steps in mind, I will now attempt to transform the given test input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:

Test input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]`

Transformed output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]`

As expected, the transformed output sequence consists of objects similar to those in the input sequence, but with their positions adjusted according to the number of non-zero elements in the input sequence.

Therefore, the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences seems to be that the input sequence is transformed into an output sequence consisting of objects with sizes determined by the number of non-zero elements in the input sequence, and colors assigned based on the colors of the corresponding non-zero elements in the input sequence.
