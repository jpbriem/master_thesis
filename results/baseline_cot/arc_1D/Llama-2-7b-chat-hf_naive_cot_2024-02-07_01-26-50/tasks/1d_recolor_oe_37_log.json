The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are important for the transformation. The noise pixels are represented by random integers outside of the range [0, 9].\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a simple pattern:\n\n* Each object is moved towards the center of the sequence by a fixed amount (scale factor = 2).\n* Each object is resized by a factor equal to the square root of the number of pixels it covers (size factor = sqrt(coverage)).\n* Each object is aligned with the center of the sequence (alignment = center).\n* Two objects that overlap are merged into one (merge if overlap).\n* A new object is created for each pair of adjacent pixels that are the same color (new object creation = merge if adjacent).\n\nHere are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence using their size, position, and color.\n3. Transform each object according to the above pattern.\n4. Create a new object for each pair of adjacent pixels that are the same color.\n5. Output the resulting sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to move, resize, align, merge, and create new objects in a way that preserves the color distribution of the original sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nInput:\n```json\n[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nObject description:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 9, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, position: (0, 0), size: 2\n* Object_2: {color: 9, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}, position: (0, 1), size: 2\n* Object_3: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}, position: (0, 2), size: 2\n\nTransformed objects:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 9, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 4}, position: (0, 0), size: 4\n* Object_2: {color: 9, start_index: 3, end_index: 5, size: 4}, position: (0, 1), size: 4\n* Object_3: {color: 9, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 4}, position: (0, 2), size: 4\n\nOutput:\n```json\n[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the positions and sizes of the objects may change during the transformation process, but their color remains unchanged."
