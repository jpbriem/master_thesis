The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 (starting at index 1) two positions to the right, so that it becomes object 2.\n\nInput: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nStep 2: Scale object 2 (starting at index 2) by a factor of 2 in both directions, so that it becomes twice as large.\n\nInput: `[0, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 14, 16, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nStep 3: Remove object 3 (starting at index 5).\n\nInput: `[0, 14, 16, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 14, 16, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nStep 4: Recolor object 4 (starting at index 6) to red.\n\nInput: `[0, 14, 16, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 14, 16, 12, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nAnd there you have it! The final output sequence is `[0, 14, 16, 12, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nNow, let me explain the overall pattern behind these input-output pairs. It seems that the transformation pattern involves applying a series of operations to the input sequence, where each operation moves, scales, removes, or recolors an object in the sequence. These operations are applied in a specific order, with some operations depending on the previous operations. For example, the movement of object 1 in Step 1 depends on the presence of object 2 in the sequence, while the scaling of object 2 in Step 2 depends on the size of object 1 after its movement. Similarly, the removal of object 3 in Step 3 depends on the presence of object 4 in the sequence, and the recoloring of object 4 in Step 4 depends on the presence of object 3 in the sequence.\n\nFinally, here are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using this transformation pattern:\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Apply the operations in the order they appear in the transformation pattern.\n2. Use the appropriate logic rules to determine when to apply each operation, based on the current state of the input sequence.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the entire input sequence has been transformed into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
