The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will infer the simplest possible relation between input and output and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nRelation Between Input and Output:\nAfter analyzing the given input-output pairs, I have identified a common pattern in the transformation process. The objects in the input sequence are transformed based on certain logical rules, such as moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and removing. These transformations are applied to the objects in the input sequence, and the resulting positions, sizes, and colors of the objects are used to create the output sequence.\n\nTransformation Steps:\nTo transform the test input sequence, I will follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence.\nStep 2: Apply the logical rules to each object in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and removing.\nStep 3: Update the positions, sizes, and colors of the objects in the output sequence based on the results of Step 2.\n\nTransformed Objects:\nThe transformed objects in the output sequence will have the following properties:\n\n* Positions: The positions of the objects in the output sequence will be determined based on their original positions in the input sequence and the logical rules applied in Step 2.\n* Sizes: The sizes of the objects in the output sequence will be determined based on their original sizes in the input sequence and the logical rules applied in Step 2.\n* Colors: The colors of the objects in the output sequence will be determined based on their original colors in the input sequence and the logical rules applied in Step 2.\n\nOutput Sequence:\nThe resulting output sequence will be created by applying the transformations outlined above to the input sequence. The length of the output sequence will be equal to the length of the input sequence.\n\nTest Output:\nHere is the transformed test input sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the length of the output sequence is 16, which is the same as the length of the input sequence.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I have inferred the simplest possible relation between input and output and transformed the test input sequence into its test output sequence using the specified transformation steps."
