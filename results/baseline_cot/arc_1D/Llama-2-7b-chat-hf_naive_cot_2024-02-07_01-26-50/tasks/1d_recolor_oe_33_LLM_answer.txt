You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2.
In the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 4), we need to move Object 1 to Position 2. To do this, we simply shift the entire Object 1 section to the right by 2 positions.

Step 2: Scale Object 2 by a Factor of 2 Horizontally.
Object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. We need to scale it horizontally by a factor of 2, so we multiply each element of Object 2 by 2. This will make Object 2 twice as wide as it was originally.

Step 3: Remove Object 3.
Object 3 has a starting index of 6 and an ending index of 6. Since the ending index of Object 3 is equal to the starting index of Object 3, we can safely remove Object 3 from the sequence since it does not overlap with any other object.

Step 4: Recolor Object 1 to Color 3.
Object 1 had a color of 2 in the input sequence, but we want it to have a color of 3 in the output sequence. So, we simply replace each element of Object 1 with the corresponding element of Color 3.

Step 5: Move Object 4 to Position 7.
Object 4 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8. Since the starting index of Object 4 is greater than the starting index of Object 1 (which is 1), we need to move Object 4 to Position 7. To do this, we simply shift the entire Object 4 section to the right by 7 positions.

Step 6: Scale Object 5 by a Factor of 2 Vertically.
Object 5 has a starting index of 9 and an ending index of 9. We need to scale it vertically by a factor of 2, so we multiply each element of Object 5 by 2. This will make Object 5 twice as tall as it was originally.

Step 7: Remove Object 6.
Object 6 has a starting index of 10 and an ending index of 10. Since the ending index of Object 6 is equal to the starting index of Object 6, we can safely remove Object 6 from the sequence since it does not overlap with any other object.

Step 8: Recolor Object 2 to Color 8.
Object 2 had a color of 3 in the input sequence, but we want it to have a color of 8 in the output sequence. So, we simply replace each element of Object 2 with the corresponding element of Color 8.

Step 9: Move Object 7 to Position 11.
Object 7 has a starting index of 12 and an ending index of 12. Since the starting index of Object 7 is greater than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 4), we need to move Object 7 to Position 11. To do this, we simply shift the entire Object 7 section to the right by 11 positions.

Step 10: Scale Object 8 by a Factor of 2 Horizontally.
Object 8 has a starting index of 13 and an ending index of 13. We need to scale it horizontally by a factor of 2, so we multiply each element of Object 8 by 2. This will make Object 8 twice as wide as it was originally.

And there you have it! By following these steps, we can transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence.

As for the test output, here it is:

[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
