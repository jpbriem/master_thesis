The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 (background) or a number between 1 and 9 (representing different pixel colors). The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 (background) or a number between 1 and 9 (representing different pixel colors), but with some elements changed compared to the input sequence. Specifically, every second element in the output sequence has been shifted one position to the right compared to the input sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of 12 elements, where each element is either 0 (background) or a number between 1 and 9 (representing different pixel colors). The output sequence also consists of 12 elements, where each element is either 0 (background) or a number between 1 and 9 (representing different pixel colors), but with some elements changed compared to the input sequence. Specifically, every third element in the output sequence has been shifted one position to the left compared to the input sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 (background) or a number between 2 and 9 (representing different pixel colors). The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 (background) or a number between 2 and 9 (representing different pixel colors), but with some elements changed compared to the input sequence. Specifically, every other element in the output sequence has been multiplied by 2 compared to the input sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves shifting or scaling the elements in the output sequence relative to the input sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation pattern to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Shift every second element in the input sequence one position to the right.\n\nOutput after Step 1: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 2: Scale every third element in the output sequence by a factor of 2.\n\nOutput after Step 2: [12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence is:\n\n[12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo, the transformation pattern for this problem is:\n\n* Shift every second element in the input sequence one position to the right.\n* Scale every third element in the output sequence by a factor of 2.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
