prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input and output pairs, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between them and then apply it to transform a new input into its corresponding output.

From the given examples, we can observe that the input and output sequences consist of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. Additionally, adjacent pixels of the same color form objects, and there are logical rules that govern the transformation of these objects. These rules include moving, hollowing, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, and aligning objects.

Based on these observations, my inference is that the transformation from input to output involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence according to the given logical rules. Specifically, for each object in the input sequence, I need to perform the following steps:

1. Identify the object: Determine whether a particular pixel has an adjacent pixel of the same color, indicating the presence of an object. If no object is found, skip to step 2.
2. Apply transformation rules: Depending on the type of object (e.g., move, hollow, scale, etc.), apply the appropriate transformation rule to the object. For example, if the object is moved, shift the entire object by the specified amount in the direction indicated by the rule.
3. Update the object's properties: After applying the transformation rule, update the object's properties accordingly. For instance, if the object is scaled, adjust its size accordingly.
4. Repeat for all objects: Iterate through all objects in the input sequence and apply the transformation rules to each one.

Now, let me apply this inference to the provided test case input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Objects in the input sequence:

Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 7, size: 3}
Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 8, end_index: 11, size: 3}

Transformation rules for each object:

Object 1: Move 2 units to the right.
Object 2: Scale by a factor of 2 horizontally.

After applying the transformation rules, the resulting output sequence would look like this:

Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Note that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence and consists of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, including 0 for the background color. Also, the objects in the output sequence have the same properties as their counterparts in the input sequence (i.e., size, position, and color).
