You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.

Firstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 6 ones, while the output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 6 ones as well. There is no obvious transformation happening here.
* Example_2: In this case, the input sequence consists of 5 ones and 5 twos, while the output sequence consists of 5 ones and 5 twos again. This suggests that there is no transformation happening between the input and output sequences.
* Example_3: Here, the input sequence consists of 7 ones and 0 twos, while the output sequence consists of 7 ones and 0 twos as well. Again, there is no transformation happening between the input and output sequences.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern between input and output is simply copying the input sequence without any modification. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one mapping, where each element in the input sequence corresponds to an identical element in the output sequence.

Now, let's consider how to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions:

1. Move: Since there is no movement involved in the given transformation pattern, this action is not applicable.
2. Hollow: As mentioned earlier, there is no hole creation or filling involved in the given transformation pattern, so this action is also not applicable.
3. Scale: The input and output sequences have the same length, so scaling is not necessary.
4. Remove: Since the input and output sequences consist of the same elements, there is nothing to remove.
5. Copy: Given the simplicity of the transformation pattern, we can directly copy the input sequence to obtain the output sequence.
6. Recolor: Since the input and output sequences consist of the same elements, there is no need to recolor them.
7. Sorting: Since the input and output sequences are of the same length and consist of the same elements, there is no need to sort them.

Therefore, the transformation rule for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence is:

Transformed Input = Copy(Input)

Using this rule, we can now transform the given test input sequence:

Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

By applying the transformation rule, we get the following output sequence:

Output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As requested, please provide the transformed input sequence in JSON format:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
"Example_2": "..."
},

"instructions": "Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step.",

},

}
