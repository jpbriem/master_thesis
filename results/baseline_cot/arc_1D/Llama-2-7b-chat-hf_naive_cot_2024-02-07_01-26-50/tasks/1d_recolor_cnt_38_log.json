The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero elements) and background pixels (represented by zero elements). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and background pixels, but with some changes in their sizes and positions. Specifically, the objects in the output sequence are larger than those in the input sequence, and some of them are shifted horizontally.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nSimilar to Example 1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and background pixels, while the output sequence shows some changes in the sizes and positions of the objects. However, there are some differences in the way the objects are aligned and overlapped in these two examples.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Given the test case input:\n```json\n[0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can propose the following steps to transform this input sequence into its output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, we have three objects:\n\nObject 1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}\nObject 2: {color: 3, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}\nObject 3: {color: 3, start_index: 10, end_index: 11, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to each object based on the logical rules provided earlier. For example, for Object 1, we can apply the \"move\" operation to shift it horizontally by 2 pixels. Similarly, for Object 2, we can apply the \"scale\" operation to enlarge it by a factor of 2 in both directions. For Object 3, we can apply the \"remove\" operation to delete it completely.\n\nStep 3: Update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence based on the transformations applied in Step 2.\n\nStep 4: Repeat Steps 1-3 for each iteration of the input sequence until the entire sequence has been processed.\n\nTherefore, the proposed transformation rule for the test case input is:\n\nTransform the input sequence as follows:\n\nStep 1: Identify objects: Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}, Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}, Object 3: {color: 3, start_index: 10, end_index: 11, size: 1}.\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations:\n\n* Move Object 1 horizontally by 2 pixels.\n* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both directions.\n* Remove Object 3 completely.\n\nStep 3: Update positions and sizes of objects in the output sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 5, size: 3}.\n* Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 6, end_index: 10, size: 4}.\n* Object 3: None.\n\nStep 4: Repeat Steps 1-3 for each iteration of the input sequence until the entire sequence has been processed.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence for the test case input is:\n```json\n[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that this is just one possible transformation rule based on the patterns observed in the input-output pairs provided. There may be other valid transformation rules depending on the specific requirements of the problem."
