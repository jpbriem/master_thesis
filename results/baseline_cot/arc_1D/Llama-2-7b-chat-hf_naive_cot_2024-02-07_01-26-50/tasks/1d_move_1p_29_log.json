The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating objects in the input sequence based on their properties (such as size, position, and color). Specifically, the pattern appears to involve the following operations:\n\n* Moving objects horizontally or vertically by a fixed number of positions.\n* Scaling objects up or down by a factor.\n* Removing objects based on their color or position.\n* Copying objects from one location to another.\n* Recoloring objects to change their color.\n\nTo apply these operations, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their size, position, and color.\n\nStep 2: Determine the operation to be applied to each object based on its properties (e.g., moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring).\n\nStep 3: Apply the determined operation to each object in the input sequence.\n\nHere are some more detailed descriptions of the objects and operations involved in the transformation pattern:\n\nObjects:\n\n* Object_1: A rectangular block of pixels with a specific color and position in the input sequence.\n* Object_2: A smaller rectangular block of pixels with a different color and position in the input sequence.\n\nOperations:\n\n* Move: Horizontally or vertically moves an object by a fixed number of positions.\n* Scale: Multiplies the size of an object by a specified factor.\n* Remove: Deletes an object based on its color or position.\n* Copy: Copies an object from one location to another.\n* Recolor: Changes the color of an object to a new value.\n\nUsing these operations, we can transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence. Here's an example of how we could perform the transformation for the given input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects: Object_1 (size = 6, position = 1) and Object_2 (size = 4, position = 5).\n\nStep 2: Determine the operation to be applied to each object based on its properties. For Object_1, we will move it horizontally by 2 positions (since the pattern specifies that adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects), so the updated position will be 3. For Object_2, we will scale it up by a factor of 2, so its new size will be 8.\n\nStep 3: Apply the determined operation to each object in the input sequence. As a result, the output sequence will be:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the resulting output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and the objects in the output sequence have the same properties (size, position, and color) as those in the input sequence."
