The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9, where 1 represents the background color and 9 represents the object color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The objects in the output sequence are also designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, but their positions and sizes may change compared to the input sequence.\n\nThe transformation pattern between the input and output sequences is as follows:\n\n* All objects in the input sequence are moved towards the right by one pixel.\n* Any object that overlaps with another object is removed (i.e., replaced by the other object).\n* Any remaining object is resized by dividing its width by 2.\n\nFor example, consider the input sequence `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Applying the transformation pattern, we get the output sequence `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. As you can see, all objects in the input sequence have been moved towards the right by one pixel, and any overlap between objects has been resolved by removing the smaller object. Additionally, any remaining object has been resized by dividing its width by 2.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Iterate through each element in the input sequence, applying the transformation rules as follows:\na. If the current element is 0, skip it and proceed to the next element.\nb. Otherwise, move the current element to the right by one pixel in the output sequence.\nc. Check if there is an overlap between the current element and any other element in the output sequence. If there is an overlap, remove the smaller element.\nd. Resize any remaining object in the output sequence by dividing its width by 2.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the entire input sequence has been processed.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how to perform the transformation on the given input sequence:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence `['0', '8', '8', '8', '0', '0', '0', '0', '8', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']`.\n2. Apply the transformation rules to each element in the input sequence:\na. Move the first element (`'0'`), which is not an object, to the right by one pixel in the output sequence. This gives us `'8'`.\nb. Move the second element (`'8'`), which is an object, to the right by one pixel in the output sequence. This gives us `'8'`.\nc. Move the third element (`'8'`), which is still an object, to the right by one pixel in the output sequence. This gives us `'8'`.\nd. Move the fourth element (`'8'`), which is still an object, to the right by one pixel in the output sequence. This gives us `'8'`.\ne. Since there are no more objects in the input sequence, stop here.\n\nThe resulting output sequence would be: `'8', '8', '8', '8', '0', '0', '0', '0', '8', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
