            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the objects seem to be moved, resized, and aligned with each other. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are three objects: Object 1 (size = 4), Object 2 (size = 4), and Object 3 (size = 4).\n\nStep 2: Move Object 1 one position to the right, so that it aligns with Object 2. This means that the starting index of Object 1 becomes the ending index of Object 2, and vice versa.\n\nStep 3: Resize Object 2 to twice its original size (i.e., increase its size by a factor of 2).\n\nStep 4: Align Object 3 with Object 1, so that they are side by side. To do this, move Object 3 one position to the left, and then resize it to match the size of Object 1.\n\nStep 5: Remove Object 1 from the sequence, since it has been moved to the right and is now part of Object 2.\n\nStep 6: Sort the remaining objects in the sequence according to their sizes. The sorted order should be: Object 2 (size = 8), Object 3 (size = 4), Object 1 (size = 4).\n\nStep 7: Repeat Step 2-6 for each object in the sequence, moving them around and resizing them as necessary to maintain their relative positions and sizes.\n\nHere's an example of how the transformation process could be applied to the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. There are four objects: Object 1 (size = 4), Object 2 (size = 4), Object 3 (size = 4), and Object 4 (size = 4).\n\nStep 2: Move Object 1 one position to the right, so that it aligns with Object 2. This means that the starting index of Object 1 becomes the ending index of Object 2, and vice versa.\n\nStep 3: Resize Object 2 to twice its original size (i.e., increase its size by a factor of 2).\n\nStep 4: Align Object 3 with Object 1, so that they are side by side. To do this, move Object 3 one position to the left, and then resize it to match the size of Object 1.\n\nStep 5: Remove Object 1 from the sequence, since it has been moved to the right and is now part of Object 2.\n\nStep 6: Sort the remaining objects in the sequence according to their sizes. The sorted order should be: Object 2 (size = 8), Object 3 (size = 4), Object 4 (size = 4).\n\nStep 7: Repeat Steps 2-6 for each object in the sequence, moving them around and resizing them as necessary to maintain their relative positions and sizes.\n\nAfter applying these steps to the input sequence, the resulting output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps!
