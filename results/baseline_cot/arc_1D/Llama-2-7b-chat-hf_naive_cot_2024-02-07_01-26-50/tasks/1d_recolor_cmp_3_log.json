The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, rotating, and merging objects.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. **Move**: Shift the entire input sequence by 1 pixel to the right.\n2. **Scale**: Multiply each pixel value in the input sequence by a factor of 2.\n3. **Rotate**: Rotate the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise.\n4. **Merge**: Merge the two adjacent objects in the input sequence into a single object.\n5. **Remove**: Remove the background color (0) from the output sequence.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation of each operation:\n\n1. **Move**: The reason for shifting the input sequence by 1 pixel to the right is to ensure that the objects in the input sequence do not overlap with each other. By doing so, we create space between the objects and prevent them from touching each other.\n2. **Scale**: Scaling each pixel value in the input sequence by a factor of 2 helps to maintain the relative distances between the objects. Without scaling, the objects would become too large and may overlap with each other, leading to incorrect results.\n3. **Rotate**: Rotating the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise helps to align the objects properly in the output sequence. This rotation also ensures that the objects are correctly positioned relative to each other.\n4. **Merge**: Merging the two adjacent objects in the input sequence into a single object helps to reduce the number of objects in the output sequence while preserving their relative positions. This operation also helps to eliminate any small gaps that may exist between the objects.\n5. **Remove**: Removing the background color (0) from the output sequence helps to highlight the objects and make them more visible.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to shift, scale, rotate, merge, and remove elements from the input sequence to produce the output sequence. Each operation is applied sequentially to transform the input sequence into the output sequence.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence as the starting point for the transformation.\n2. Apply the moves, scales, rotations, merges, and removes operations in the order listed above.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the desired output sequence is obtained.\n\n**Transformation**\n\n* **Input**: Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n* **Object Description**: Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color. The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size.\n* **Transformed Objects**: Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color. After applying the transformation operations, the objects in the output sequence should be larger than in the input sequence and have a consistent color.\n* **Output**: Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\n**Test Output**: Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!"
