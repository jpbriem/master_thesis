You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are specified in the output sequence.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions, sizes, and colors.
2. Move each object to the next position in the output sequence, while maintaining its size and color.
3. If two or more objects overlap, remove the overlapping parts and adjust the remaining objects accordingly.
4. Scale each object by a factor determined by its distance from the background color.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until no further changes occur.

Here's an example of how these steps would work for the given input sequence:

Input sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]`

Step 1: Identify objects and their positions, sizes, and colors.

* Object 1: Position: 1-2, Size: 2, Color: 4
* Object 2: Position: 3-4, Size: 2, Color: 4
* Object 3: Position: 5-6, Size: 1, Color: 4

Step 2: Move each object to the next position in the output sequence.

* Object 1 moves to position 3
* Object 2 moves to position 5
* Object 3 remains at position 6

Step 3: Overlap removal and scaling.

* Object 1 overlaps with Object 2, so they merge and become one object with a size of 3x2=6 pixels.
* Object 3 overlaps with Object 1, so they merge and become one object with a size of 2x2=4 pixels.
* Object 2 scales down by a factor of 0.75 due to its distance from the background color.

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until no further changes occur.

Output sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern in this problem is that the input sequence consists of objects, each represented by a sequence of adjacent pixels of the same color. These objects are moved to the next position in the output sequence, while maintaining their size and color. Any overlapping objects are removed and adjusted accordingly, and each object is scaled by a factor determined by its distance from the background color. This process continues until no further changes occur.

**Transformation**

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to follow the above steps. Here's a high-level outline of the transformation process:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions, sizes, and colors.
2. Move each object to the next position in the output sequence, while maintaining its size and color.
3. If two or more objects overlap, remove the overlapping parts and adjust the remaining objects accordingly.
4. Scale each object by a factor determined by its distance from the background color.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until no further changes occur.

**Test Output**

Using the given input sequence, here's the resulting test output sequence:
```json
[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Note that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and the objects are correctly positioned, sized, and colored according to the transformation rules defined earlier.
