The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to the second position.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 is located at index 1, while in the output sequence, it is located at index 2. To achieve this movement, we simply shift the entire object 1 to the right by one position in both the input and output sequences.\n\nStep 2: Scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 2 has a size of 2, while in the output sequence, it has a size of 4. To achieve this scaling, we multiply each element of object 2 in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\n\nStep 3: Remove object 3 from the input sequence.\n\nIn the input sequence, there is an object located at index 4, which we will remove. We simply set all elements of this object to 0 in both the input and output sequences.\n\nStep 4: Recolor object 4 to have a color of 9.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 4 has a color of 0, while in the output sequence, it has a color of 9. To achieve this recoloring, we simply replace each element of object 4 in the input sequence with the corresponding element of the output sequence, where each element is multiplied by a factor of 9.\n\nStep 5: Move object 5 to the last position in the output sequence.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 5 is located at index 8, while in the output sequence, it is located at index 9. To achieve this movement, we simply shift the entire object 5 to the right by one position in both the input and output sequences.\n\nAnd that's it! By applying these five steps to the input sequence, we can transform it into the corresponding output sequence.\n\nRegarding the overall pattern, it appears that the transformation involves applying a series of operations to the input sequence in a specific order, where each operation modifies the sequence in some way. These operations include moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. The exact nature of these operations depends on the specific input and output sequences being used."
