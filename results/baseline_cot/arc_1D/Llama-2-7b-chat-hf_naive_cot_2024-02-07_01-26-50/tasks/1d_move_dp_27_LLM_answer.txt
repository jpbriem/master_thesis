You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]` into its corresponding output sequence:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects:

Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}
Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}

Step 2: Move Object 1 one position to the right. Since Object 1 has a size of 3, it will cover three positions in the output sequence. Therefore, we need to shift Object 1 to the right by three positions, so that it starts at index 8 in the output sequence.

Step 3: Scale Object 2 horizontally by a factor of 2. This means that Object 2 will be twice as wide in the output sequence compared to its original width in the input sequence.

Step 4: Remove the background color (0) from the entire input sequence. This leaves us with a sequence of only the object colors.

Step 5: Recolor Object 1 to have a color of 9 instead of 7.

And here's the final output sequence:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9]

Now, let me provide more detailed descriptions of the above steps, along with any necessary instructions or transformations for each step:

Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence

* Instructions: Carefully examine the input sequence and identify any distinct regions of the same color that could potentially form objects.
* Transformations: None required for this step.

Step 2: Move Object 1 one position to the right

* Instructions: Shift Object 1 to the right by one position, so that it starts at index 8 in the output sequence.
* Transformations: None required for this step.

Step 3: Scale Object 2 horizontally by a factor of 2

* Instructions: Multiply the width of Object 2 by a factor of 2, so that it covers twice as much space in the output sequence.
* Transformations: None required for this step.

Step 4: Remove the background color from the entire input sequence

* Instructions: Replace every element in the input sequence with the maximum value (i.e., 9), except for the elements that correspond to the objects.
* Transformations: None required for this step.

Step 5: Recolor Object 1 to have a color of 9 instead of 7

* Instructions: Replace every element in Object 1 with the value 9, instead of the original value of 7.
* Transformations: None required for this step.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of these steps.
