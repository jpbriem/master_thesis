You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the objects seem to be moved, resized, and aligned with each other. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

From the given input sequence, we can identify three objects:

* Object 1: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] (size = 5)
* Object 2: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] (size = 6)
* Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4] (size = 5)

Step 2: Apply transformations to the objects

Based on the given output sequences, we can see that the objects are transformed in the following ways:

* Object 1 is moved 3 positions to the right (from index 1 to index 4).
* Object 2 is shrunk by half in both dimensions (from size 6 to size 3).
* Object 3 is moved 2 positions down (from index 8 to index 6).

Therefore, the transformed objects in the output sequence will be:

* Object 1: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] (size = 5)
* Object 2: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] (size = 3)
* Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4] (size = 5)

Step 3: Align the objects with each other

In the output sequence, the objects are aligned with each other based on their sizes. Specifically, the largest object (Object 2) is aligned with the smallest object (Object 3) at the center. Therefore, the transformed objects in the output sequence will be aligned as follows:

* Object 1 is aligned with Object 2 at the center.
* Object 2 is aligned with Object 3 at the center.

Step 4: Sort the objects based on their sizes

In the output sequence, the objects are sorted based on their sizes. Specifically, the largest object (Object 2) is placed first in the sequence, followed by the next largest object (Object 1), and so on. Therefore, the transformed objects in the output sequence will be sorted as follows:

* Object 2 (size = 5)
* Object 1 (size = 5)
* Object 3 (size = 5)

And that's it! By applying these transformations to the input sequence, we can generate the corresponding output sequence.

Here's the complete transformation process in JSON format:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "Move Object 1 3 positions to the right.",
    "Example_2": "Shrink Object 2 by half in both dimensions.",
    "Example_3": "Move Object 3 2 positions down."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Manipulate objects based on their sizes",
  "instructions": "Transform the input sequence by applying the above transformations to the objects. Think step by step.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]",
    "object_description": [
      {
        "size": 5,
        "position": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
      },
      {
        "size": 6,
        "position": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
      },
      {
        "size": 5,
        "position": [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
      }
    ],
    "transformed_objects": [
      {
        "size": 5,
        "position": [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
      },
      {
        "size": 3,
        "position": [4, 4, 4]
      },
      {
        "size": 5,
        "position": [6, 7, 8]
      }
    ],
    "output": "[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]"
  },
  "test_output": "[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]"
}
```
