You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has one of nine possible values (0-8) representing different colors. The input and output sequences also contain zero-valued pixels that represent the background color.

To begin with, let's analyze the input and output sequences provided as examples:

Example_1:
Input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

From the input sequence, we can observe that there are five instances of the value 5, which suggests that these pixels may form some kind of object. Similarly, the output sequence shows that only four of these objects remain after the transformation, with the remaining pixels being set to 0. This implies that the transformation may involve removing or hollowing out some of the objects in the input sequence.

Example_2:
Input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this case, we see that the input sequence contains three instances of the value 3, which may indicate that these pixels form another object. The output sequence shows that two of these objects are removed, while the remaining object is resized to have a length of 1.

Now, let's consider the general pattern of the transformation. Based on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, hollowing out, and copying objects. These operations may be applied conditionally based on the values of the pixels and their relationships to other pixels in the sequence.

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply these operations in a systematic way, taking into account the values and positions of the pixels in the input sequence. Here's a step-by-step approach we can follow:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the following operations:
a. If the current pixel value is non-zero, check if it forms an object with other neighboring pixels. If so, perform the appropriate operation(s) on the object, such as moving, scaling, hollowing out, or copying.
b. If the current pixel value is zero, check if it is part of an existing object. If so, remove the object from the output sequence.
c. Otherwise, set the current pixel value to zero and add it to the output sequence.
3. Repeat step 2 until the end of the input sequence is reached.

By following this approach, we should be able to transform any input sequence into its corresponding output sequence according to the given transformation pattern.

Finally, here's the requested JSON data structure for the given input sequence:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. The input sequence contains five instances of the value 5, which may form some kind of object. After the transformation, only four of these objects remain.",
"Example_2": "..."
},
"overall_pattern": "Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
"instructions": "Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, thinking step by step.",
"transformation": {
"input": "[copy the test case input sequence from the task]",
"object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.",
"transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.",
"output": "[create the resulting test output sequence]"
},
"test_output": "[return the created test output sequence in numpy array format]"
}
