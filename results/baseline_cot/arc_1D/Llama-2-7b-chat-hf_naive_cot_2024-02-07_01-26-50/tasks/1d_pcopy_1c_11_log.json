The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 11 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. Each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the corresponding pixel in the input sequence is black or white. There are no objects in the input sequence, and there are no noise pixels. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple bitwise XOR operation.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of 11 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. However, in this case, each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 6, indicating whether the corresponding pixel in the input sequence is black or white. Again, there are no objects in the input sequence, and there are no noise pixels. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is another simple bitwise operation, i.e., a bitwise AND operation.\n* Example_3: This is the most complex input-output pair provided, with an input sequence consisting of 8 pixels and an output sequence consisting of 8 pixels as well. In this case, each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 4, indicating whether the corresponding pixel in the input sequence is black or white. There are two objects in the input sequence, represented by the values 0 and 4, respectively. The objects are aligned horizontally, and their sizes are equal. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a combination of a bitwise AND operation followed by a horizontal shift operation.\n\nNow, let's apply these transformation actions to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the given transformation actions, we can transform the input sequence as follows:\n\n1. Apply a bitwise AND operation to each pair of adjacent pixels in the input sequence, starting from the leftmost pixel. This will create a new sequence where each pixel value is set to 0 if the corresponding pixel in the original input sequence is black, and 1 otherwise.\n2. Perform a horizontal shift operation on the resulting sequence, moving each pixel one position to the right. This will align the objects in the sequence horizontally.\n3. Apply a bitwise OR operation to each pair of adjacent pixels in the shifted sequence, starting from the leftmost pixel. This will create a new sequence where each pixel value is set to 1 if the corresponding pixel in the original input sequence is white, and 0 otherwise.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire input sequence has been processed.\n\nThe resulting output sequence will consist of 8 pixels, with each pixel value ranging from 0 to 4, depending on the presence or absence of objects in the input sequence. The objects in the input sequence will be preserved in the output sequence, with their positions and sizes unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence for the given input sequence is:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the resulting output sequence may not have the exact same length as the input sequence, depending on the specific transformation actions applied."
