[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 11 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. Each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 2, indicating that the objects in the input sequence are being transformed into either black or white pixels in the output sequence.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 15 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. Each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 9, indicating that the objects in the input sequence are being transformed into either black or white pixels in the output sequence.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. Each pixel value in the output sequence is either 6 or 0, indicating that the objects in the input sequence are being transformed into either red or green pixels in the output sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves converting each object in the input sequence into a corresponding object in the output sequence, where each object is represented by a single pixel value (either 0 or 1). The size and position of the objects in the input sequence do not seem to affect the output sequence.

Now, let's consider a new input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Using the above observation, we can infer that the output sequence will consist of 11 pixels, where each pixel value will be either 0 or 2, depending on whether the corresponding object in the input sequence was black or white.

To transform this input sequence into its output sequence, we can simply apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: There are 3 objects in total - one at index 0, one at index 4, and one at index 8.
2. Determine the color of each object: The object at index 0 is black, the object at index 4 is white, and the object at index 8 is also white.
3. Transform each object into its corresponding pixel value in the output sequence: The object at index 0 becomes pixel value 0, the object at index 4 becomes pixel value 2, and the object at index 8 becomes pixel value 2.

Therefore, the transformed output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Finally, here is the requested JSON data structure containing the description of the transformation pattern, the instruction for transforming a new input sequence, and the transformed output sequence:
