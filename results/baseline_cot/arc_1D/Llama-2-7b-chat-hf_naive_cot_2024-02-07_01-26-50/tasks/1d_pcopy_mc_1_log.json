The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include size, position, and color. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, and aligning them. The noise pixels are also taken into account during the transformation process.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).\n2. Apply the necessary operations to each object based on the transformation pattern (e.g., move, scale, hollow, copy, recolor).\n3. Align the objects with respect to each other and the background color.\n4. Sort the objects based on their size and position.\n5. Remove any redundant or unnecessary objects.\n\nHere are the detailed instructions for each step:\n\n**Step 1: Identify objects and their properties**\n\n* Iterate through the input sequence and identify the consecutive pixels of the same color as an object.\n* Record the object's properties, including its size (the number of pixels it covers), position (the index of the first pixel in the object), and color (the pixel value).\n\n**Step 2: Apply operations to objects**\n\n* Based on the transformation pattern, determine the operation(s) to apply to each object. This may involve moving the object to a different position, scaling it up or down, hollowing it out, copying it, recoloring it, or aligning it with other objects.\n* Apply the determined operation(s) to each object in the input sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Align objects with respect to each other and the background**\n\n* Determine the optimal alignment of the objects with respect to each other and the background color. This may involve rotating, translating, or resizing the objects to achieve proper alignment.\n* Apply the alignment operation to each object in the input sequence.\n\n**Step 4: Sort objects based on size and position**\n\n* Sort the objects in the input sequence based on their size (largest to smallest) and position (closest to farthest from the background color).\n\n**Step 5: Remove redundant or unnecessary objects**\n\n* Remove any objects that are redundant or unnecessary after the previous steps. This may involve merging smaller objects or removing objects that are no longer visible after the transformation process.\n\n**Overall pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to take the input sequence of pixels and apply a series of operations to transform it into an output sequence of pixels that follow the desired pattern. The operations involved may include moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, aligning, and sorting. The goal is to produce an output sequence that has the same structure and pattern as the input sequence, but with the objects transformed and arranged according to the given transformation pattern.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo transform the input sequence, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence as the starting point for our transformation.\n2. Move each object in the input sequence to its final position based on the alignment operation.\n3. Scale each object in the input sequence to its final size based on its original size and position.\n4. Hollow each object in the input sequence to create space for any additional objects.\n5. Copy any additional objects from the output sequence and paste them into the empty spaces created in step 4.\n6. Recolor each object in the input sequence to match its final color based on the transformation pattern.\n7. Align the objects in the input sequence with respect to each other and the background color.\n8. Sort the objects in the input sequence based on their size and position.\n9. Remove any redundant or unnecessary objects from the input sequence.\n\n**Test output**\n\nUsing the provided input sequence, we get the following output sequence:\n```json\n[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0"
