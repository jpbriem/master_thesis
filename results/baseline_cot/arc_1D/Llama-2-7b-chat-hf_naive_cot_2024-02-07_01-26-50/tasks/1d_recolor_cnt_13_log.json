The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are grouped together based on their color. The objects are also aligned horizontally. In the output sequence, each object is shifted one position to the right compared to the input sequence. Additionally, some objects are scaled up or down depending on their original size.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, the objects in the input sequence are again grouped based on their color. However, the objects in the output sequence are not aligned horizontally. Instead, they are scattered randomly throughout the sequence. It seems that the transformation involves shuffling the objects around and scaling them up or down.\n\nBased on these observations, it appears that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a simple shift and rescaling operation. Specifically, for each object in the input sequence, we can shift it one position to the right and scale it up or down based on its original size. This transformation can be applied element-wise to the entire input sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the transformation rule we derived earlier, we can apply the following operations to the input sequence:\n\n* Shift each object one position to the right:\n\t+ Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\t+ Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\t+ Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Scale each object based on its original size:\n\t+ Object 1: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]\n\t+ Object 2: [0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 0.75, 0.75, 4.25, 4.25, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 4.25, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 4.25, 4.25, 0.75, 4.25, 4.25, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75]\n\t+ Object 3: [0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 3.6, 3.6, 3.6, 0.6, 0.6, 3.6, 3.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 3.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 3.6, 3.6, 0.6, 3.6, 3.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6]\n\nThe resulting transformed output sequence is:\n\nOutput: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule we derived earlier can be used to transform any input sequence into its corresponding output sequence."
