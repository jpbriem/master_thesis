            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has one of nine possible values (0-8) representing different colors. The input and output sequences may also contain \"noise\" pixels, which are pixels that do not belong to any object.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: Based on the given examples, it appears that objects are defined as contiguous sequences of pixels that have the same color. In the input sequence [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], there are two objects:\n\t* Object 1: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\n\t* Object 2: {color: 5, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}\n2. Determine the transformation rules: From the given examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and removing objects. Additionally, noise pixels may be added or removed.\n3. Transform the input sequence: Using the identified objects and transformation rules, transform the input sequence [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] into its corresponding output sequence. Here's one possible transformation:\n\t* Move Object 1 three positions to the right: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 7, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\t* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2: [0, 7, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 14, 10, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\t* Remove Object 1: [0, 14, 10, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 14, 10, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n4. Output the transformed sequence: The final output sequence is [0, 14, 10, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this specific input sequence is:\n\t* Move an object three positions to the right.\n\t* Scale an object by a factor of 2.\n\t* Remove an object.\n\nFor other input sequences, the transformation pattern may be different, but the general approach remains the same: identify the objects, determine the transformation rules, apply the transformations, and output the result."
