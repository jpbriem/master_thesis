You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2.
In the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 0), we need to move Object 1 to Position 2.

Step 2: Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.
Object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. By scaling it by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, we can make it twice as large as it was originally.

Step 3: Remove Object 3.
Object 3 has a starting index of 7 and an ending index of 7. Since it is located at the same position as Object 2, we can simply remove it from the sequence since it overlaps with Object 2.

Step 4: Recolor Object 1 to have a color of 8.
In the input sequence, Object 1 has a color of 1. By recoloring it to have a color of 8, we can change its appearance significantly.

Step 5: Copy Object 1 to Position 8.
Since Object 1 has already been moved to Position 2 in Step 1, we don't need to move it again. Instead, we can simply copy it to Position 8 to create a new object there.

Step 6: Scale Object 4 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.
Object 4 has a starting index of 9 and an ending index of 9. By scaling it by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, we can make it twice as large as it was originally.

Step 7: Remove Object 5.
Object 5 has a starting index of 10 and an ending index of 10. Since it is located at the same position as Object 4, we can simply remove it from the sequence since it overlaps with Object 4.

Step 8: Recolor Object 2 to have a color of 6.
In the input sequence, Object 2 has a color of 3. By recoloring it to have a color of 6, we can change its appearance slightly.

Step 9: Copy Object 2 to Position 6.
Since Object 2 has already been scaled by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions in Step 2, we don't need to scale it further. Instead, we can simply copy it to Position 6 to create a new object there.

And that's it! Applying these steps to the input sequence will result in the output sequence shown above.

Regarding the overall pattern, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying a series of operations to the input sequence in a specific order, where each operation moves, scales, removes, or recolors one or more objects in the sequence. The exact order and combination of operations may vary depending on the specific input and output pairs, but the general approach of applying operations in a specific order seems to be a common theme throughout the problem set.
