            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn the input sequence provided, there are three objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 4}\n* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 4}\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 10, size: 2}\n\nStep 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object\n\nFor each object, apply the specified transformation rule:\n\n* Move Object 1 one position to the right (i.e., from index 5 to index 6).\n* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., from indices 6 to 8, and from indices 8 to 10).\n* Remove Object 3 (since it has a size of 2 and is located at index 9, which is outside the range of the input sequence).\n\nStep 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 for multiple iterations\n\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 for multiple iterations, applying the transformation rules in a random order each time. This will ensure that the output sequence is diverse and unpredictable.\n\nStep 4: Output the transformed sequence\n\nOutput the transformed sequence, using the same indexing scheme as the input sequence (i.e., zero-indexing).\n\nHere's an example of how the transformation process could look like for a single iteration:\n\nInput sequence: `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`\n\nObject 1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 4}\n\nMove Object 1 one position to the right: `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`\n\nObject 2: {color: 4, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 4}\n\nScale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both directions: `[0, 0, 4, 8, 16, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`\n\nObject 3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 10, size: 2}\n\nRemove Object 3 since it has a size of 2 and is located at index 9, which is outside the range of the input sequence: `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`\n\nOverall pattern: The input sequence is transformed into a new sequence where each object is moved, scaled, or removed according to a set of predefined rules. The resulting sequence is diverse and unpredictable."
