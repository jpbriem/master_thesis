The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nFrom the input sequence, we can see that there are two objects:\n\nObject 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n\nThe transformation rule for this pair is:\n\nMove object 1 to the right by one pixel.\n\nSo, the output sequence is obtained by moving object 1 to the right by one pixel and then repeating the remaining pixels unchanged.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nIn this case, there are no objects in the input sequence. However, the transformation rule is:\n\nScale all pixels by a factor of 2 horizontally.\n\nSo, the output sequence is obtained by scaling each pixel in the input sequence by a factor of 2 horizontally.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\nAgain, there are no objects in the input sequence. The transformation rule is:\n\nRotate the entire sequence clockwise by 90 degrees.\n\nSo, the output sequence is obtained by rotating the input sequence clockwise by 90 degrees.\n\nNow, let's apply these transformation rules to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nUsing the transformation rules above, we can obtain the following output sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this task is:\n\n* Move objects to the right by one pixel.\n* Scale all pixels by a factor of 2 horizontally.\n* Rotate the entire sequence clockwise by 90 degrees.\n\nFinally, the instructions for transforming a new input sequence would be:\n\n1. Copy the given input sequence.\n2. Apply the transformation rules to the input sequence to obtain the output sequence.\n\nNote that the output sequence may have a different length than the input sequence, depending on the specific transformation rules applied."
