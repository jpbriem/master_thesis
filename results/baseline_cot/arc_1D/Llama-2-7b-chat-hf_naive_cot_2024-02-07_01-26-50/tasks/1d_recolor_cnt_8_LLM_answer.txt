You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In each input sequence, there are several distinct regions of the same color, which can be considered as objects. In the given input sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0], the objects are:

* Object 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3}
* Object 2: {color: 5, start_index: 4, end_index: 7, size: 3}
* Object 3: {color: 5, start_index: 8, end_index: 11, size: 3}

Step 2: Apply transformations to the objects

Based on the given transformation patterns, we can apply the following operations to each object:

* Move the objects horizontally by one pixel (i.e., shift them to the right).
* Scale the objects by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double their size).
* Remove the middle pixel of each object (i.e., reduce their size by half).

Here's how these operations would affect the objects in the input sequence:

Object 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 3} -> {color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 2}
Object 2: {color: 5, start_index: 4, end_index: 7, size: 3} -> {color: 5, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 2}
Object 3: {color: 5, start_index: 8, end_index: 11, size: 3} -> {color: 5, start_index: 9, end_index: 10, size: 2}

Step 3: Combine the transformed objects

After applying the transformations to each object, we need to combine them to form the output sequence. We can do this by simply concatenating the transformed objects along the horizontal axis.

So, the transformed output sequence would be:

{color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 2} + {color: 5, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 2} + {color: 5, start_index: 9, end_index: 10, size: 2} = {color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 14, size: 6}

Step 4: Repeat the process for additional input sequences

To transform a new input sequence, we can repeat steps 1-3 until we reach the desired output length. For example, if we want to transform an input sequence of length 10, we would apply the above operations 4 times (since each operation takes 4 pixels) to produce a transformed output sequence of length 10.

That's the basic idea behind this problem! Of course, there may be more complex variations of this pattern, but hopefully this helps get you started. Good luck with your project!
