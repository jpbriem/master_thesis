            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to position 2.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. To move it to position 2, we simply shift the entire object to the right by two positions. So, the updated input sequence after Step 1 would be:\n\nInput (after Step 1): [7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 2: Scale object 2 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. To scale it by a factor of 2, we multiply each value in the object by 2 in both the x and y directions. So, the updated input sequence after Step 2 would be:\n\nInput (after Step 2): [7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 3: Remove object 3.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 3 has a starting index of 6 and an ending index of 6. To remove it, we simply delete the entire object from the sequence. So, the updated input sequence after Step 3 would be:\n\nInput (after Step 3): [7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 4: Recolor object 1 to have a color of 9 instead of 2.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. To recolor it, we replace each value in the object with the corresponding value in the output sequence, which has a color of 9 instead of 2. So, the updated input sequence after Step 4 would be:\n\nInput (after Step 4): [7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 5: Copy object 4 and paste it at position 3.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 4 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8. To copy it, we make a deep copy of the object and assign it to a new object at position 3. So, the updated input sequence after Step 5 would be:\n\nInput (after Step 5): [7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, [8, 8]]\n\nStep 6: Scale object 5 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 5 has a starting index of 10 and an ending index of 10. To scale it by a factor of 2, we multiply each value in the object by 2 in both the x and y directions. So, the updated input sequence after Step 6 would be:\n\nInput (after Step 6): [7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, [8, 8], [2, 2]]\n\nAnd finally, we repeat these steps until there are no more objects left in the input sequence. The resulting output sequence would be:\n\nOutput sequence: [7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, [8, 8], [2, 2], [2, 2], [2, 2]]\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern involves moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them in a specific order to produce the desired output sequence."
