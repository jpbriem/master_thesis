            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given input-output pairs, I will infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nThe simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one mapping between each input element and its corresponding output element. In other words, each input element is replaced by an identical output element. This means that the output sequence consists of the same elements as the input sequence, but with the same values.\n\nUsing this simple transformation rule, I can transform the test input sequence as follows:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you requested, here is the description of the transformation actions required to transform a new input into its output:\n\n1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n2. Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n\t* Input sequence: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\t* Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n3. Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n\t* Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n4. Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\nAnd finally, here is the JSON response with the necessary information:\n\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'No change', 'Example_2': 'Move 9 to position 1', 'Example_3': 'Scale 9 to size 7'}, 'overall_pattern': 'One-to-one mapping between input and output elements', 'instructions': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task, describe the objects in the input sequence, focus on size, position, color.
