You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, some of the object sizes have been increased or decreased, and some objects have been moved or aligned differently.
* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, the modifications in the output sequence are more significant, with some objects being removed or recolored.
* Example_3: This input sequence consists of a single large object surrounded by smaller objects. The output sequence modifies the positions and sizes of these objects, while maintaining their overall structure.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the positions, sizes, and colors of objects in the input sequence to create the output sequence. Here's my reasoning:

1. Objects: The input sequence contains objects, which are represented by non-zero values. These objects may undergo various transformations, such as moving, scaling, or changing color.
2. Relationships: The input sequence also contains relationships between objects, such as alignment, overlap, and containment. These relationships may be preserved or modified during the transformation process.
3. Noise pixels: The input sequence includes noise pixels, which do not affect the overall structure of the objects. These noise pixels may be ignored or incorporated into the transformation process.
4. Arithmetic operations: The transformation pattern involves performing arithmetic operations on the objects, such as counting, sorting, or scaling. These operations may be used to modify the positions, sizes, and colors of the objects in the output sequence.
5. Conditional rules: There are no explicit conditional rules provided, but it's possible that the transformation pattern involves applying different transformations based on specific conditions, such as the size or color of an object.

Now, let me apply these insights to the test input sequence provided:

Input sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the transformation pattern observed in the input-output pairs, I propose the following steps to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are three objects with sizes 6, 6, and 6.

Step 2: Apply transformations to each object based on the arithmetics involved in the transformation pattern. For example, one object may be scaled up by a factor of 2, another object may be moved 3 positions to the right, and the third object may be recolored to green.

Step 3: Take into account the relationships between objects, such as alignment and overlap. For instance, two adjacent objects may be aligned horizontally, or an object may be partially contained within another object.

Step 4: Ignore the noise pixels in the input sequence and focus solely on the objects and their relationships.

Step 5: Apply any additional conditional rules or noise injection techniques to further refine the transformation process.

And here's the proposed transformed output sequence:

Output sequence: [0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to transform the input sequence into its output sequence based on the given transformation pattern.
