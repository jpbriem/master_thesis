The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their starting and ending indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves several operations, including moving, scaling, and removing objects. The exact rules for these operations are as follows:\n\n* Move an object by k pixels if the object is at position i and the next pixel after position i is not part of any other object.\n* Scale an object by a factor of k if the object is at position i and the next pixel after position i is not part of any other object.\n* Remove an object if it has no neighboring objects at the same position.\n\nBased on these rules, we can deduce the following steps to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions.\nStep 2: Move each object by one pixel towards the right (or left) if there is no object at the next position.\nStep 3: Scale each object by a factor of 2 if there is no object at the next position.\nStep 4: Remove any object that has no neighboring objects at the same position.\n\nBy applying these steps, we can transform the input sequence into the output sequence. Here's the detailed explanation of each step:\n\nStep 1: Identifying objects and determining their sizes and positions\n\nIn the input sequence, the objects are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color. We need to identify these objects and determine their sizes and positions in the sequence. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, the objects are `Object_1` (size=2, position=[1, 2]) and `Object_2` (size=1, position=[4, 5]).\n\nStep 2: Moving objects towards the right (or left)\n\nIf there is no object at the next position, we move the current object by one pixel towards the right (or left). This ensures that the objects do not overlap with each other. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, we would move `Object_1` by one pixel towards the right after the second pixel.\n\nStep 3: Scaling objects by a factor of 2\n\nIf there is no object at the next position, we scale the current object by a factor of 2. This ensures that the objects remain distinct and do not merge with each other. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, we would scale `Object_1` by a factor of 2 after the third pixel.\n\nStep 4: Removing objects that have no neighboring objects at the same position\n\nWe remove any object that has no neighboring objects at the same position. This ensures that the objects are well-defined and do not overlap with each other. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, we would remove `Object_2` because it does not have any neighboring objects at the same position.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to move, scale, and remove objects based on their positions and distances from each other. By applying these operations recursively, we can transform the input sequence into the output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following transformation steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions.\n2. Move each object by one pixel towards the right (or left) if there is no object at the next position.\n3. Scale each object by a factor of 2 if there is no object at the next position.\n4. Remove any object that has no neighboring objects at the same position.\n\nHere's the detailed transformation process for the given input sequence:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, the input sequence contains two objects: Object_1 (size=2, position=[1, 2]) and Object_2 (size=1, position=[4, 5]). After applying the transformation, the output sequence contains two objects: Object_1 (size=2, position=[1, 2]) and Object_2 (size=1, position=[4, 5]).\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"Move, scale, and remove objects based on their positions and distances from each other.\",\n  \"instructions\": \"Apply the following transformation steps to transform a new input sequence into its output sequence:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions.\n2. Move each object by one pixel towards the right (or left) if there is no object at the next position.\n3. Scale each object by a factor of 2 if there is no object at the next position.\n4. Remove any object that has no neighboring objects at the same position.\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, the objects are:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\"\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"After applying the transformation, the objects in the output sequence are:\n\n* Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\"\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\"\n  }\n}\n```\nNote that the transformation process is recursive, meaning that we apply the same operations to each object in the sequence until the entire sequence has been transformed."
