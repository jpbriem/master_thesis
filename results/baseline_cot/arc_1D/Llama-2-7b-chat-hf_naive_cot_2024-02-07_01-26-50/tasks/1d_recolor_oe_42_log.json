            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Understand the input sequence\nThe input sequence consists of 10 pixels, each with a value between 1 and 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. There are two objects in the input sequence: Object 1 has a size of 2 pixels and starts at index 1, while Object 2 has a size of 1 pixel and starts at index 4.\n\nStep 2: Identify the transformation rules\nFrom the given input-output pairs, we can identify some common transformation rules that are applied to the input sequence. These include:\n\n* Moving objects: The positions of Object 1 and Object 2 are shifted by one pixel in the output sequence compared to the input sequence.\n* Scaling objects: Both objects are scaled up by a factor of 2 in the output sequence compared to the input sequence.\n* Removing objects: Object 1 is removed from the output sequence entirely, while Object 2 is reduced in size by half.\n* Recoloring objects: The colors of both objects are modified in the output sequence, with Object 1 becoming darker (value = 7) and Object 2 becoming lighter (value = 3).\n\nStep 3: Create a transformation matrix\nTo apply these transformation rules consistently, we can create a transformation matrix that encodes the changes between the input and output sequences. Specifically, the transformation matrix would look like this:\n\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | -1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n| 1 |  0 | -2 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n| 2 |  0 |  0 | -3 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n| 3 |  0 |  0 |  0 | -4 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n| 4 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 | -5 |  0 |  0 |  0 |\n| 5 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 | -6 |  0 |  0 |\n| 6 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 | -7 |  0 |\n| 7 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 | -8 |\n| 8 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 | -9 |\n\nIn this matrix, the rows represent the input pixels, and the columns represent the output pixels. Each element in the matrix indicates the change in value between the input and output pixels. For example, the element at row 1 and column 2 represents the change in value for the second input pixel relative to the first input pixel.\n\nStep 4: Apply the transformation matrix\nUsing the transformation matrix, we can now apply the necessary transformations to the input sequence to obtain the output sequence. Specifically, we can multiply the transformation matrix by the input sequence to get the output sequence. Here's the result:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has the same structure as the input sequence, but with the colors and positions of the objects modified according to the transformation rules.\n\nThat's it! By breaking down the problem into smaller steps and using the transformation matrix to encode the transformation rules, we were able to successfully transform the input sequence into the output sequence."
