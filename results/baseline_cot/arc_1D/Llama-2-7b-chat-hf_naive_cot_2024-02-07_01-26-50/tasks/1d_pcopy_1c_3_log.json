The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with each object being larger than the previous one.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of a single object (represented by three consecutive non-zero values) followed by a sequence of noise pixels. The output sequence consists of multiple objects, where each object is represented by a contiguous sequence of non-zero values.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of a single object (represented by five consecutive non-zero values) followed by a sequence of noise pixels. The output sequence consists of multiple objects, where each object is represented by a contiguous sequence of non-zero values.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves scaling up the objects in the input sequence while maintaining their spatial relationships. Specifically, the objects in the output sequence are larger than the corresponding objects in the input sequence, and they are arranged in a similar spatial layout.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 2, 2, 0, 3]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: There are two objects in the input sequence, represented by non-zero values.\n2. Scale up the objects: Increase the size of each object by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions. This means that the first object should be scaled to [4, 4], and the second object should be scaled to [6, 6].\n3. Maintain the spatial relationships: Ensure that the scaled objects are placed in the same spatial locations as the original objects.\n4. Add noise pixels: Add noise pixels to the output sequence to replace the remaining zero values.\n\nHere's the transformed output sequence:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 4, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the output sequence has the same number of objects as the input sequence, but with each object being larger than the corresponding object in the input sequence. The spatial relationships between the objects are maintained, and the noise pixels are added to fill in the remaining gaps.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for this problem can be summarized as follows:\n\nTransformation Rule: Take an input sequence consisting of objects and noise pixels, and transform it into an output sequence by scaling up the objects while maintaining their spatial relationships, and adding noise pixels to fill in the remaining gaps."
