The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and removing objects.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right.\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double their size).\n3. Remove any object that overlaps with another object by checking if the distance between them is less than or equal to the sum of their sizes. If an object overlaps with another object, remove it and update the remaining objects accordingly.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more objects can be removed.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of each step:\n\nStep 1: Move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right.\n\nIn the input sequence, there are two objects of size 2 each, separated by a gap of size 1. After moving the objects one position to the right, the new positions of the objects would be:\n\nObject 1: [0, 2], [0, 2 + 1 = 3]\nObject 2: [0, 2], [0, 2 + 1 = 3]\n\nStep 2: Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions.\n\nAfter scaling the objects, they would become twice their original size:\n\nObject 1: [0, 4], [0, 6]\nObject 2: [0, 4], [0, 6]\n\nStep 3: Remove any object that overlaps with another object by checking if the distance between them is less than or equal to the sum of their sizes.\n\nThere are three objects in the input sequence that overlap with each other: Object 1, Object 2, and Object 3. The distances between these objects are:\n\n* Object 1 and Object 2: distance = 1, sum of sizes = 2 + 2 = 4\n* Object 2 and Object 3: distance = 1, sum of sizes = 2 + 2 = 4\n* Object 1 and Object 3: distance = 1, sum of sizes = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSince the distance between each pair of overlapping objects is less than or equal to the sum of their sizes, we remove the smallest object (Object 1) and update the remaining objects accordingly. The updated positions of the objects after removal are:\n\nObject 1: [0, 2], [0, 2 + 1 = 3]\nObject 2: [0, 4], [0, 6]\nObject 3: [0, 4], [0, 6]\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until no more objects can be removed.\n\nWe repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more objects that can be moved or removed. In this case, there are no more objects that can be moved or removed, so we stop here.\n\nThe resulting output sequence is:\n\n[0, 4], [0, 6]\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right, scale them by a factor of 2 in both directions, and remove any object that overlaps with another object. We repeat these steps until no more objects can be removed.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to perform the following actions:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right.\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions.\n3. Remove any object that overlaps with another object by checking if the distance between them is less than or equal to the sum of their sizes.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and make it the new input sequence.\n2. Apply the transformation actions listed above to the new input sequence.\n3. Output the resulting sequence as the new output sequence.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nUsing the given input sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWe get the following output sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence."
