[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 11 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 3) at index 3. The output sequence also consists of 11 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 8) at index 3. It seems that the transformation involves replacing each non-zero element with a neighboring non-zero element in the same color category.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 2 non-zero elements (colors 6 and 8) at indices 6 and 8 respectively. The output sequence also consists of 10 zeros and 2 non-zero elements (colors 8 and 6) at indices 8 and 6 respectively. Similar to Example_1, it appears that the transformation involves replacing each non-zero element with a neighboring non-zero element in the same color category.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 9 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 7) at index 7. The output sequence also consists of 9 zeros and 1 non-zero element (color 8) at index 7. Again, it seems that the transformation involves replacing each non-zero element with a neighboring non-zero element in the same color category.

Based on these observations, it appears that the transformation rule is simply moving each non-zero element to the nearest neighboring position where there is already a non-zero element of the same color category. This rule applies recursively until all positions have been filled.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Using the transformation rule, we can fill the output sequence as follows:

Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As expected, the output sequence has the same structure as the input sequence but with all non-zero elements moved to their nearest neighboring position according to the transformation rule.

Therefore, the transformation rule for this problem is simple: for each non-zero element in the input sequence, move it to the nearest neighboring position where there is already a non-zero element of the same color category.

To summarize, the description for the input-output pairs would be:

* Example_1: Objects: 2, 3, Size: 2, Position: {start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
* Example_2: Objects: 6, 8, Size: 2, Position: {start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}
* Example_3: Objects: 7, 8, Size: 1, Position: {start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 1}

And the overall pattern for the input-output relationship would be:

Input sequence: [color, size, position]
Output sequence: [color, size, position]

Finally, here is the JSON object containing the necessary information to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "Object 2 moves two positions to the right.",
"Example_2": "Object 6 moves two positions to the left.",
"Example_3": "Object 7 moves one position to the left."
},
"overall_pattern": "move non-zero elements to nearest neighboring position",
"instructions": "apply the transformation rule to the input sequence",
"transformation": {
"input": "[0, 0,..., 0, 0]",
"object_description": "[color, size, position]",
"transformed_objects": "[0, 0,..., 0, 0]",
"output": "[0, 0,..., 0, 0]"
},
"test_output": "[0, 0,..., 0, 0]"
}
