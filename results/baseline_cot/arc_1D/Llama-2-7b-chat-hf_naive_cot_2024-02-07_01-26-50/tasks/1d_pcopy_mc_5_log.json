The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a simple pattern:\n\n* All pixels with value 0 are replaced with value 9.\n* All pixels with value 9 are unchanged.\n* All other pixels are replaced with the average of their neighboring pixels (horizontally or vertically).\n\nHere are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence.\n2. Replace all pixels with value 0 with value 9.\n3. Calculate the average of each pixel's neighboring pixels (horizontally or vertically) and replace the pixel with that value.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no more changes are made.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to progressively smooth out the input sequence by replacing each pixel with the average of its neighbors. This creates a gradient effect where the colors transition smoothly from one shade to another.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo transform an input sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Copy the input sequence**: `input = np.array(input)`\n2. **Replace all zeros with nine**: `input[input == 0] = 9`\n3. **Calculate the average of each pixel's neighbors**: `avg = np.mean(np.concatenate((input - 1), axis=0), axis=0)`\n4. **Replace each pixel with the average**: `output[i] = avg[i]`\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until no more changes are made.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nThe test output sequence will be the resulting sequence after applying the transformation to the input sequence.\n\n**Test Case**\n\nFor the given test case, here's how we would apply the transformation:\n\n1. **Copy the input sequence**: `input = np.array([0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`\n2. **Replace all zeros with nine**: `input[input == 0] = 9`\n3. **Calculate the average of each pixel's neighbors**: `avg = np.mean(np.concatenate((input - 1), axis=0), axis=0)`\n4. **Replace each pixel with the average**: `output[i] = avg[i]`\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until no more changes are made.\n\nThe resulting test output sequence will be: `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`."
