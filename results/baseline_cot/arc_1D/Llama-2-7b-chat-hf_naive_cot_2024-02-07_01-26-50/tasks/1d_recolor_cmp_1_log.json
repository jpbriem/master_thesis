The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn the input sequence provided, there are three objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 3}\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 9, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nBased on the given transformation pattern, we can apply the following operations to each object:\n\n* Move Object 1 one position to the right (i.e., from index 1 to index 2).\n* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions (i.e., from size 3 to size 6).\n* Remove Object 3 (since it has a size of 1 and is therefore not considered an object).\n\nStep 3: Update the positions and sizes of the remaining objects\n\nAfter applying the above transformations, the updated positions and sizes of the objects would be:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 4, start_index: 2, end_index: 5, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 4, start_index: 7, end_index: 10, size: 6}\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until no more transformations are applied\n\nSince the given input sequence contains multiple objects, we need to repeat steps 1-3 for each iteration of the sequence. In other words, after applying the transformations to the objects in the first iteration, we need to identify the objects in the next iteration, apply the transformations to them, update their positions and sizes, and so on.\n\nStep 5: Transform the input sequence into the output sequence\n\nOnce we have identified and transformed all the objects in the input sequence, we can combine them to form the output sequence. In this case, the output sequence would be:\n\n{color: 4, start_index: 2, end_index: 10, size: 6}\n{color: 4, start_index: 7, end_index: 10, size: 6}\n{color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 9, size: 1}\n\nTherefore, the output sequence for the given input sequence is [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0].\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, the overall pattern of the transformation appears to involve applying a series of operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. These operations are applied repeatedly until no more transformations are left to be applied. The resulting output sequence consists of a combination of the transformed objects, with each object having a unique position, size, and color."
