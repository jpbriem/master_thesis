The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9, where each integer represents a different pixel color or background. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are important for the transformation. The noise pixels are represented by random integers outside of the range [1, 9].\n\nThe transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, rotating, and merging objects. The exact rules for these operations are not specified, but they seem to follow a logical set of concepts such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment. Additionally, there are arithmetical operations based on the objects, such as counting and sorting. Finally, there are conditions that may affect the transformation, although their nature is not clear.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply the appropriate combination of these operations while taking into account the size, position, and color of each object. The output sequence will have the same structure as the input sequence, with each element representing a pixel color or background.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nBased on the given examples, it seems that the overall pattern for transforming an input sequence into its output sequence is as follows:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and position.\n2. Apply operations to the objects, such as moving, scaling, rotating, and merging, based on their distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\n3. Perform arithmetical operations based on the objects, such as counting and sorting.\n4. Use conditions to determine the outcome of the transformation.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 until the output sequence is generated.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and make sure to preserve its length.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and position.\n3. Apply operations to the objects, such as moving, scaling, rotating, and merging, based on their distance, alignment, overlap, and containment.\n4. Perform arithmetical operations based on the objects, such as counting and sorting.\n5. Use conditions to determine the outcome of the transformation.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the output sequence is generated.\n7. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how I would transform the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence. Based on the given examples, the objects are likely to be defined by adjacent pixels of the same color. In this case, the objects are:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply operations to the objects based on their distance, alignment, overlap, and containment. Since the given examples do not provide any specific operation rules, I will assume that the operations are as follows:\n\n* Move Object 1 one pixel to the right.\n* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.\n* Rotate Object 1 by 90 degrees clockwise.\n* Merge Object 1 with Object 2.\n\nStep 3: Perform arithmetical operations based on the objects. Since the given examples do not provide any specific operation rules, I will assume that the operations are as follows:\n\n* Count the number of pixels in Object 1.\n* Sort the pixels in Object 2 based on their color.\n\nStep 4: Use conditions to determine the outcome of the transformation. Since the given examples do not provide any specific condition rules, I will assume that the conditions are as follows:\n\n* If the number of pixels in Object 1 is odd, then merge Object 1 with Object 2. Otherwise, do nothing.\n* If the color of the top-most pixel in Object 2 is different from the color of the bottom-most pixel in Object 2, then rotate Object 2 by 90 degrees counterclockwise. Otherwise, do nothing.\n\nRepeating these steps until the output sequence is generated results in the following transformation:\n\nOutput: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nNote that the actual transformation may depend on the specific rules provided in the problem statement."
