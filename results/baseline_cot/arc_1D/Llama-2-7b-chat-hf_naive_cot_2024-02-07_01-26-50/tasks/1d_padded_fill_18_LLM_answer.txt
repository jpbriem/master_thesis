prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given examples and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output.

From the examples provided, it seems that the transformation from input to output involves the following steps:

1. Movement: Pixels are moved horizontally by one position.
2. Scaling: Pixels are scaled up by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.
3. Color modification: Pixels change their color based on a specific rule. If the current pixel's color is even, the next pixel's color becomes the opposite of the current pixel's color (i.e., if the current pixel is blue, the next pixel becomes red). Otherwise, the next pixel's color remains unchanged.
4. Overlap removal: Any overlapping pixels are removed.
5. Alignment: Pixels are aligned vertically.
6. Containment: Pixels are contained within a rectangular area defined by the input sequence.

Based on these observations, I will make the following assumptions about the input-output relationship:

1. The input sequence consists of pixels represented as integers between 0 and 9, where 0 represents the background color and 1 represents an object.
2. Each pixel in the input sequence corresponds to a single pixel in the output sequence, shifted horizontally by one position.
3. The color of each pixel in the output sequence is determined by the color of the corresponding pixel in the input sequence, modified according to the specified color modification rule.
4. Any overlapping pixels in the output sequence are removed.
5. The output sequence has the same number of pixels as the input sequence.

With these assumptions in mind, I will now provide the requested transformations for the given input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

	* Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
2. Scale by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions:
	* Input sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
	* Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
