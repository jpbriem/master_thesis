You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In the given input sequence, there are six objects:

Object 1: Color = 6, Start Index = 1, End Index = 6, Size = 5
Object 2: Color = 6, Start Index = 7, End Index = 12, Size = 5
Object 3: Color = 6, Start Index = 13, End Index = 18, Size = 5
Object 4: Color = 0, Start Index = 19, End Index = 20, Size = 1
Object 5: Color = 9, Start Index = 21, End Index = 26, Size = 5
Object 6: Color = 0, Start Index = 27, End Index = 32, Size = 5

Step 2: Apply transformations to each object

Based on the given transformation pattern, we can apply the following transformations to each object:

* Move each object one position to the right (i.e., shift the entire object to the right).
* Scale each object by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions (i.e., double the size of each object).
* Remove any noise pixels (i.e., set them to 0).

Here's how these transformations would affect each object in the input sequence:

Object 1: After moving, the object would be located at positions [2, 7, 13, 19, 25], after scaling, the object would be twice as large in both dimensions, so it would be located at positions [4, 8, 16, 24, 32]. After removing noise pixels, the object would consist of five consecutive pixels with color 6.

Object 2: Similar to Object 1, after moving, the object would be located at positions [3, 8, 14, 20, 26], after scaling, the object would be twice as large in both dimensions, so it would be located at positions [5, 10, 20, 28, 36]. After removing noise pixels, the object would consist of five consecutive pixels with color 6.

Object 3: Same as Object 1 and Object 2.

Object 4: Since this object has a size of 1, no transformation is applied to it.

Object 5: After moving, the object would be located at positions [4, 10, 16, 22, 28], after scaling, the object would be twice as large in both dimensions, so it would be located at positions [8, 12, 20, 26, 32]. After removing noise pixels, the object would consist of five consecutive pixels with color 9.

Object 6: Same as Object 5.

Step 3: Transform the output sequence

After applying the transformations to each object, we need to combine the transformed objects to form the output sequence. We can do this by concatenating the transformed objects in the correct order, starting from the first object and ending at the last object.

For example, the transformed output sequence for the given input sequence would be:

[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Note that the transformed output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.

That's it! These are the steps I would follow to solve this problem. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
