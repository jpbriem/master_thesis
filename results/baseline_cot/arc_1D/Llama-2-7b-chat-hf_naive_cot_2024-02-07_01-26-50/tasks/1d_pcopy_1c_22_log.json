The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The objects are also assigned a unique ID based on their position in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves applying a series of logical rules to the input sequence, which are as follows:\n\n1. Move any object one position to the right if there is no object to the left of it.\n2. If an object overlaps with another object to the right, remove the smaller object.\n3. Scale any object by a factor of 2 in either direction (i.e., increase or decrease the size of the object by half).\n4. Remove any object that is completely covered by another object.\n5. Copy any object and paste it after the last object in the sequence.\n6. Recolor any object to match the color of the next object in the sequence.\n7. Sort the objects in the sequence based on their ID.\n\nThese rules are applied iteratively until no further changes can be made to the sequence. The resulting output sequence is then returned.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to manipulate the objects in the input sequence by moving them, scaling them, removing them, copying them, recoloring them, and sorting them. These operations are applied in a specific order and combination to produce the output sequence.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the logical rules listed above to each object in the sequence.\n3. For each object that is moved, scaled, removed, copied, recolored, or sorted, update the corresponding element in the output sequence accordingly.\n4. Once all objects have been processed, return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo perform the transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\n2. Apply the logical rules listed above to each object in the input sequence, using the IDs assigned to the objects in the input sequence.\n3. Update the corresponding elements in the output sequence accordingly.\n4. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nThe test output sequence for the given input sequence is:\n```json\n[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the test output sequence has the same length as the input sequence and contains only the objects that were present in the input sequence, with their original sizes and positions preserved."
