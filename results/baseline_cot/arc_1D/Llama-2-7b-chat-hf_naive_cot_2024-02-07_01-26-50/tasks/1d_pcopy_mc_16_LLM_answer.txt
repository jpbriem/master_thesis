You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the relations between them include moving, scaling, and overlapping. The noise pixels are represented by random integers between 0 and 9.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.
2. Scale the objects by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., horizontally and vertically).
3. Move the objects towards the center of the sequence by a distance equal to half their original size.
4. Overlap the objects by shifting them slightly towards each other, so that they partially cover each other.
5. Remove any remaining noise pixels.

Here's a more detailed explanation of each step:

1. **Identify objects and their positions**: In the input sequence, we identify objects by finding consecutive pixels of the same color. We then store their positions in an array called `object_pos`. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the objects are located at positions `{0, 2, 4, 6}`.
2. **Scale objects**: We scale each object by a factor of 2 in both directions. This means that the width and height of each object are doubled, while maintaining their relative positions. For example, the object at position `{2}` has a width of 4 pixels before scaling, and after scaling it has a width of 8 pixels.
3. **Move objects towards the center**: We move each object towards the center of the sequence by a distance equal to half its original size. This means that the center of each object is shifted towards the center of the sequence by half its original width and height. For example, the object at position `{2}` is moved towards the center by a distance of 4 pixels (half of its original width).
4. **Overlap objects**: We overlap the objects by shifting them slightly towards each other. Specifically, we shift each object towards the center of the sequence by a distance equal to half its original size, and then shift it back by the same amount in the opposite direction. This creates a partial overlap between the objects, where some parts of each object are covered by others. For example, the object at position `{2}` overlaps with the object at position `{4}` by covering part of its top and bottom edges.
5. **Remove noise pixels**: Finally, we remove any remaining noise pixels by setting them to 0.

**Transform input sequence**: Using these steps, we can transform the input sequence `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` into the output sequence `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

**Instructions**: To transform a new input sequence, we need to follow the same steps as above. First, identify the objects and their positions in the input sequence. Then, scale each object by a factor of 2 in both directions, move it towards the center of the sequence, overlap it with neighboring objects, and remove any remaining noise pixels.

**Transformation**:

* Input: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
* Output: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
