[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and removing objects. Here's my interpretation of the transformation pattern:

Input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:

1. Move the first object (at index 0) to the second position (i.e., replace the value at index 0 with the value at index 1).
2. Scale the remaining objects by a factor of 2 (i.e., double their size).
3. Align the objects horizontally so that they are touching each other.
4. Overlap the objects so that the first object completely covers the second object.
5. Remove the second object (since it has been covered by the first object).
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, here's how I would transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:

Step 1: Copy the input sequence and apply the transformation pattern to each object in the sequence.

Step 2: Apply noise pixels to the transformed sequence to introduce random variations in the output.

Step 3: Return the resulting transformed sequence as the output.

Here's an example code implementation in Python using NumPy:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input):
    # Step 1: Copy the input sequence and apply the transformation pattern
    transformed = np.copy(input)
    for i in range(len(transformed)):
        if transformed[i] == 0:
            # Move the first object to the second position
            transformed[i + 1] = transformed[i]
        else:
            # Scale the remaining objects by a factor of 2
            transformed[i] *= 2
    
    # Step 2: Apply noise pixels to introduce random variations in the output
    transformed += np.random.randint(0, 2, size=len(transformed))
    
    return transformed
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the input sequence has the same length as the output sequence. If the input sequence is shorter than the output sequence, you may need to pad the input sequence with zeros before applying the transformation.
