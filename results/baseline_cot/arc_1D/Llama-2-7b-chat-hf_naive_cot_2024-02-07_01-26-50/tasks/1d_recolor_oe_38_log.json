The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to position 2.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of object 1 is less than the starting index of object 2 (which is 0), we need to move object 1 to position 2. Therefore, the transformed output sequence will have object 1 at position 2 instead of position 1.\n\nStep 2: Scale object 2 by a factor of 3.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. We need to scale object 2 by a factor of 3, which means that the width of object 2 in the output sequence will be 3 times the width of object 2 in the input sequence.\n\nStep 3: Remove object 3.\n\nIn the input sequence, there is no object at index 5. Therefore, we don't need to remove any object.\n\nStep 4: Recolor object 4 to red (color = 7).\n\nIn the input sequence, object 4 has a color of blue (color = 0). We need to recolor object 4 to red (color = 7) in the output sequence.\n\nStep 5: Move object 5 to position 6.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 5 has a starting index of 6 and an ending index of 7. Since the starting index of object 5 is greater than the starting index of object 6 (which is 0), we need to move object 5 to position 6 in the output sequence.\n\nStep 6: Scale object 7 by a factor of 2.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 7 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8. We need to scale object 7 by a factor of 2, which means that the width of object 7 in the output sequence will be twice the width of object 7 in the input sequence.\n\nStep 7: Remove object 8.\n\nIn the input sequence, there is no object at index 9. Therefore, we don't need to remove any object.\n\nAnd that's it! By applying these steps to the input sequence, we can transform it into the output sequence.\n\nRegarding the overall pattern, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying a series of operations to the input sequence, where each operation moves, scales, removes, or recolors an object in the sequence. The operations are applied in a specific order, with some operations depending on the results of previous operations."
