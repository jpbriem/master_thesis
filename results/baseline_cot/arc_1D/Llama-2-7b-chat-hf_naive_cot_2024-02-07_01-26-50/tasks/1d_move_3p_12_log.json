The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will infer the simplest possible relation between input and output and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nRelation Between Input and Output:\nAfter analyzing the given input-output pairs, I observe that there is a consistent pattern in the transformation of objects between the input and output sequences. Specifically, objects in the input sequence are moved towards the right by one position in each iteration, and their color value is either increased or decreased depending on the current object's color value. Additionally, noise pixels are added to the output sequence randomly.\n\nTransformation Steps:\nTo transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence, I will follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through the input sequence, starting from the leftmost pixel.\n\nStep 3a: If the current pixel value is 0 (background), skip to Step 3b.\n\nStep 3b: Find the next object in the input sequence based on the current pixel value. If no object is found, move to Step 4.\n\nStep 4: Increment the current pixel value by 1 if the current object's color value is odd, or decrement it by 1 if the current object's color value is even.\n\nStep 5: Move the current object to the right by one position in the output sequence.\n\nStep 6: Add a random noise pixel to the output sequence at the position of the current object.\n\nStep 7: Repeat Steps 3-6 until the end of the input sequence is reached.\n\nTransformed Objects:\nBased on the above transformation steps, the transformed objects in the output sequence will have the following properties:\n\n* Size: The size of the transformed objects will remain the same as in the input sequence.\n* Position: The position of the transformed objects will increase by one position in each iteration.\n* Color: The color value of the transformed objects will change according to the current object's color value. If the current object's color value is odd, the color value of the transformed object will increase by 1, otherwise, it will decrease by 1.\n\nTest Output:\nUsing the above transformation steps, I will create the test output sequence as follows:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a linear shift operation where objects are moved towards the right by one position in each iteration, and their color value is either increased or decreased depending on the current object's color value. Additionally, noise pixels are added to the output sequence randomly. By applying these transformation steps, we can transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence."
