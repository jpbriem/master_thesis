The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence.

The input and output sequences may also contain zeroes, which represent the background color.\n\nFrom the examples provided, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, rotating, and combining objects. The exact nature of these operations is not specified in the problem statement, but they seem to be designed to create complex patterns and shapes from the simple input sequence.\n\nTo solve this problem, I would suggest breaking down the input sequence into smaller chunks, analyzing each chunk, and applying the necessary transformations to generate the corresponding output chunk. Here's a high-level outline of the approach I would take:\n\n1. Parse the input sequence into smaller chunks, e.g., every 10 pixels.\n2. Analyze each chunk to identify any objects present in it, their size, position, and color.\n3. Apply the appropriate transformation operation(s) to each object in the chunk, based on the given rules and examples.\n4. Combine the transformed objects from each chunk to form the complete output sequence.\n\nSome specific steps I would consider include:\n\n* Moving objects: Shift the position of an object by a fixed amount (e.g., 1 pixel) in the horizontal or vertical direction.\n* Scaling objects: Increase or decrease the size of an object by a fixed factor (e.g., 2x or 0.5x).\n* Rotating objects: Rotate an object by a fixed angle (e.g., 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise) around its center.\n* Combining objects: Merge two or more objects into a single object, maintaining their original positions and colors.\n* Creating noise pixels: Add random values to some positions in the input sequence to introduce noise and variability in the output sequence.\n\nOnce I have applied the necessary transformations to the input sequence, I will need to convert the resulting output sequence back into a JSON format for submission.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."
