You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Move object 1 to the second position.

In the input sequence, there is an object at index 1, which we need to move to the second position. So, we replace the value at index 1 with the value at index 2 (i.e., 1), and we move the object at index 1 to the second position.

Step 2: Scale object 2 by a factor of 2 horizontally.

In the input sequence, there is an object at index 4, which we need to scale horizontally by a factor of 2. So, we multiply the value at index 4 by 2, and we shift the object at index 4 one position to the right.

Step 3: Remove object 3.

In the input sequence, there is an object at index 5, which we need to remove. So, we set the value at index 5 to 0, and we remove the object at index 5 from the sequence.

Step 4: Recolor object 4 to red.

In the input sequence, there is an object at index 6, which we need to recolor to red. So, we replace the value at index 6 with the value 3 (i.e., red), and we keep the object at index 6 unchanged in terms of its position and size.

Step 5: Copy object 5 and move it to the third position.

In the input sequence, there is an object at index 7, which we need to copy and move to the third position. So, we create a new object at index 8 with the same value as the object at index 7, and we move the object at index 7 to the third position.

Step 6: Scale object 6 by a factor of 2 vertically.

In the input sequence, there is an object at index 9, which we need to scale vertically by a factor of 2. So, we multiply the value at index 9 by 2, and we shift the object at index 9 one position downward.

Step 7: Remove object 7.

In the input sequence, there is an object at index 10, which we need to remove. So, we set the value at index 10 to 0, and we remove the object at index 10 from the sequence.

Step 8: Recolor object 8 to blue.

In the input sequence, there is an object at index 11, which we need to recolor to blue. So, we replace the value at index 11 with the value 9 (i.e., blue), and we keep the object at index 11 unchanged in terms of its position and size.

Step 9: Copy object 9 and move it to the fourth position.

In the input sequence, there is an object at index 12, which we need to copy and move to the fourth position. So, we create a new object at index 13 with the same value as the object at index 9, and we move the object at index 9 to the fourth position.

And that's it! By applying these steps to the input sequence, we can transform it into the output sequence.

Here's the final output sequence:

[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
