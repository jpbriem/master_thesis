The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and removing objects.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right.\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 0.5 in both directions (i.e., shrink them by half in width and height).\n3. Remove any object that overlaps with another object by checking if their intersection is greater than the sum of their sizes. If an object overlaps with another object, remove it and update the remaining objects accordingly.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more objects can be removed.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of each step:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence one position to the right: This involves shifting each object in the input sequence by one position to the right, so that the first object becomes the second object, the second object becomes the third object, and so on. This step helps to align the objects in the input sequence properly before applying other transformations.\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 0.5 in both directions: This involves reducing the size of each object in the input sequence by half in both width and height. This step helps to reduce the overall size of the input sequence while maintaining the relative positions of the objects.\n3. Remove any object that overlaps with another object: This involves checking if two or more objects in the input sequence intersect with each other. If they do, and their intersection is greater than the sum of their sizes, then remove the larger object(s) and update the remaining objects accordingly. This step helps to avoid having multiple objects occupying the same space, which would result in incorrect output.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more objects can be removed: This involves repeating steps 1-3 until there are no more objects that can be moved, scaled, or removed. Once all objects have been processed, the transformation is complete, and the output sequence can be generated.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to iteratively apply operations to the input sequence to gradually refine the output sequence. Each operation is designed to preserve the relative positions of the objects in the input sequence while ensuring that they do not overlap with each other. By repeatedly applying these operations, we can generate the desired output sequence.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and make it the new input sequence.\n2. Apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence by moving, scaling, and removing objects as described above.\n3. Update the output sequence with the transformed input sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\n* **Input:** Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n* **Object Description:** Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color. The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size.\n* **Transformed Objects:** Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color. After applying the transformation pattern, the objects in the input sequence will be shifted one position to the right, scaled by a factor of 0.5 in both directions, and possibly removed if they overlap with other objects.\n* **Output:** Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\n**Test Output:** Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!"
