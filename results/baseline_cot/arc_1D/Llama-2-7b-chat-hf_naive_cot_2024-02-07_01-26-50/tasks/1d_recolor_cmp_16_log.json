The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given input-output pairs, I will infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences.\n\nThe input and output sequences consist of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the relations between them include moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and containing. Noise pixels are also present in the input sequence.\n\nAfter analyzing the given input-output pairs, I have identified the following pattern in the transformation process:\n\n* The input sequence is transformed by applying a series of operations to each object in the sequence, including moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, and containing.\n* Each operation is applied to the entire object, regardless of its size or position.\n* The order of the operations is important, as some operations may depend on the previous ones.\n\nUsing this pattern, I can now transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Here's how I would do it:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Move Object_1 (size = 2) to the right by one pixel.\nObject_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 2}\n\nStep 2: Scale Object_2 (size = 1) by a factor of 2 horizontally.\nObject_2: {color: 1, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n\nStep 3: Align Object_3 (size = 1) with Object_1 at the top.\nObject_3: {color: 1, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\nStep 4: Overlap Object_4 (size = 2) with Object_2 at the left.\nObject_4: {color: 1, start_index: 7, end_index: 9, size: 2}\n\nStep 5: Contain Object_5 (size = 1) inside Object_4.\nObject_5: {color: 1, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1}\n\nStep 6: Remove Object_6 (size = 0) from the sequence.\nObject_6: {color: 0, start_index: 10, end_index: 10, size: 0}\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the above steps are just one possible way to transform the input sequence into its output sequence using the given pattern. There may be other valid ways to perform the transformation depending on the specific requirements of the problem."
