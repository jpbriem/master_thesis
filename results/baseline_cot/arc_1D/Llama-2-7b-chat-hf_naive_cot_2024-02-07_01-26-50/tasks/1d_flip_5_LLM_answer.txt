You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 4 non-zeros (objects). The output sequence also consists of 8 zeros and 4 non-zeros, but with a different distribution of objects. Specifically, the objects in the output sequence are shifted one position to the right compared to the input sequence.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 4 non-zeros, similar to Example_1. However, in this case, the objects in the output sequence are rotated by 90 degrees clockwise compared to the input sequence.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 4 non-zeros, again similar to Example_1. However, in this case, the objects in the output sequence are mirrored horizontally compared to the input sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves shifting, rotating, and mirroring the objects in the input sequence to create the corresponding objects in the output sequence.

Now, let's consider a new input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]. To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the same transformation pattern as before:

1. Shift the objects in the input sequence to the right by one position.
2. Rotate the objects in the output sequence by 90 degrees clockwise compared to the input sequence.
3. Mirror the objects in the output sequence horizontally compared to the input sequence.

After applying these transformations, the resulting output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0].

Therefore, the transformation rule for this problem can be summarized as follows:

Transformation Rule:

Input Sequence -> Output Sequence

1. Shift the objects in the input sequence to the right by one position.
2. Rotate the objects in the output sequence by 90 degrees clockwise compared to the input sequence.
3. Mirror the objects in the output sequence horizontally compared to the input sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
