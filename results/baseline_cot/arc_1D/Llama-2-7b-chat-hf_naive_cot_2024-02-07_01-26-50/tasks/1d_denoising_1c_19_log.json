The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9, where 1 represents the background color and 9 represents the object color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their index in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves applying a series of logical rules to the input sequence, which are as follows:\n\n1. Move any object that is touching another object to the other side of the gap.\n2. If there are two or more objects at the same position, remove one of them randomly.\n3. Scale any object by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2.\n4. Rotate any object by a random angle between 0 and 360 degrees.\n5. Remove any object that has been touched by another object.\n6. Add a new object at the beginning of the sequence with a random color and size.\n7. Remove any object that has been at the beginning of the sequence for more than 3 turns.\n\nThese rules are applied iteratively until no further changes occur.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to randomly manipulate the objects in the input sequence, while preserving their relative positions and sizes. This results in a highly irregular output sequence, where the objects are scattered throughout the sequence and may have undergone various transformations.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and initialize an empty output sequence.\n2. Apply the logical rules listed above to the input sequence, starting with rule 1 and proceeding to rule 7.\n3. For each iteration of the rules, update the output sequence by adding or removing elements as necessary.\n4. Repeat step 2 until no further changes occur in the output sequence.\n5. Return the final output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how the transformation should be performed for the given test cases:\n\nFor the first test case, the input sequence is:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n```\nApplying the logical rules results in the following output sequence:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nFor the second test case, the input sequence is:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nApplying the logical rules results in the following output sequence:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nFor the third test case, the input sequence is:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nApplying the logical rules results in the following output sequence:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAs you can see, the output sequences for each test case are highly irregular and do not exhibit any discernible patterns. This demonstrates that the transformation is indeed random and unpredictable."
