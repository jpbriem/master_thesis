You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the given information, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating objects in the input sequence based on their properties (such as color and position) and applying arithmetical operations to them. Here's what I can gather from the examples provided:

* In Example_1, the input sequence contains two objects of different colors (0 and 7), and the output sequence contains the same objects but with their positions swapped.
* In Example_2, the input sequence contains three objects of the same color (0), and the output sequence contains three objects of the same color but with their positions shifted by one index.
* In Example_3, the input sequence contains two objects of different colors (0 and 7), and the output sequence contains two objects of different colors but with their positions reversed.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves shuffling or rotating the objects in the input sequence based on their color or position, and possibly applying arithmetic operations to them.

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the same transformation pattern repeatedly until the output sequence is obtained. Here's a step-by-step approach to doing so:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through each element in the input sequence, and perform the necessary transformation operation(s) based on the current element's properties (e.g., color, position).
3. Update the corresponding element in the output sequence with the result of the transformation operation(s).
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire input sequence has been processed.

For example, if the input sequence is [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], the output sequence would be transformed as follows:

1. Initialize the output sequence as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
2. Iterate through each element in the input sequence:
	* Element 0: Apply no transformation since it's already 0.
	* Element 1: Shuffle the object to the right by one index (since it's of a different color than the previous object). Output: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0].
	* Element 0: Apply no transformation since it's already 0.
	* Element 0: Remove the object at index 2 (since it's of the same color as the previous object). Output: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0].
	...
3. Repeat step 2 until the entire input sequence has been processed.

Note that this is just one possible way to implement the transformation pattern, and there may be other valid approaches depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
