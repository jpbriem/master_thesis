You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has one of nine possible values (0-8) representing different colors. The input and output sequences also have zero-indexing, meaning that the first pixel in the input sequence corresponds to the first pixel in the output sequence, and so on.

To begin with, let's analyze the input and output sequences for the first pair of examples provided:

Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]`

From the input sequence, we can observe that there are six objects in total, each with a unique color value. The objects are separated by at least two consecutive zeros, indicating their boundaries. In the output sequence, these objects have been transformed in various ways:

* Object 1: Removed (from index 1 to index 2).
* Object 2: Scaled down (by factor 2) and moved to the right (from index 4 to index 6).
* Object 3: Moved up (from index 6 to index 4).
* Object 4: Scales up (by factor 2) and moves to the left (from index 8 to index 6).
* Object 5: Copied (from index 9 to index 9).
* Object 6: Removed (from index 10 to index 10).

Now, let's apply these transformations to the input sequence and create the corresponding output sequence:

Transformed Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]`

Using the same logic as before, we can identify seven objects in the transformed input sequence:

Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 0]
Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 0]
Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0]
Object 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 7, 8, 0]
Object 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 0]
Object 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 0]
Object 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As you can see, some objects have been removed or transformed in various ways, while others have remained unchanged. To create the output sequence, we simply need to apply the same transformations to the transformed input sequence. Here's the resulting output sequence:

Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]`

Finally, let's analyze the third input-output pair provided:

Input: `[0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Again, we can identify five objects in the input sequence:

Object 1: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Object 2: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Object 3: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Object 4: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Object 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In the output sequence, these objects have been transformed in the following ways:

* Object 1: Moved down (from index 3 to index 4).
* Object 2: Scaled up (by factor 2) and moved to the left (from index 4 to index 2).
* Object 3: Moved down (from index 4 to index 3).
* Object 4: Scaled down (by factor 2) and moved to the right (from index 4 to index 6).
* Object 5: Removed (from index 7 to index 7).

By applying these transformations, we get the resulting output sequence:

Output: `[0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving, scaling, and removing objects in various ways. The exact rules for each object may vary depending on the specific input sequence, but the overall pattern appears to be consistent throughout the given examples.
