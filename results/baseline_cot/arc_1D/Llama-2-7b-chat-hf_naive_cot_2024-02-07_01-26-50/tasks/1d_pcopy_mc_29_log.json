The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a simple pattern:\n\n* All objects are moved one position to the right in the output sequence.\n* If an object overlaps with another object at the next position, they are merged into a single larger object.\n* If an object has no neighbor at the next position, it is removed from the output sequence.\n\nHere are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence, starting from the first element.\n3. For each element in the input sequence, perform the following steps:\na. Check if there is an object at the current position in the output sequence. If there is, merge the two objects if they overlap.\nb. If there is no object at the current position in the output sequence, create a new object at that position with the same color as the current element.\nc. Move the current element to the next position in the output sequence.\n4. Repeat step 3 until the end of the input sequence is reached.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to move all objects one position to the right in the output sequence, merging adjacent objects that overlap, and removing any objects that have no neighbors at the next position. This creates a new arrangement of objects in the output sequence that is similar to the original input sequence but with some changes due to the movement and merging of objects.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the following transformation steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence as the starting point for the output sequence.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the following rules for each element:\na. If the element is 0, do nothing (i.e., keep the element unchanged).\nb. If the element is not 0, move it one position to the right in the output sequence.\nc. If the element overlaps with another element at the next position, merge the two elements into a single larger object.\nd. If the element has no neighbor at the next position, remove it from the output sequence.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the end of the input sequence is reached.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nUsing the given input sequence, here is the resulting output sequence:\n```json\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAs expected, all objects in the input sequence have been moved one position to the right in the output sequence, and any overlapping objects have been merged. Note that there are no remaining objects in the output sequence after the last iteration, since all objects that had no neighbor at the next position were removed."
