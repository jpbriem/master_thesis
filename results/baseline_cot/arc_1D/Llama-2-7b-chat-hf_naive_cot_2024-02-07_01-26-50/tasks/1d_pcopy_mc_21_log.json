The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include size, position, and color. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, and aligning them. The noise pixels are also taken into account during the transformation process.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).\n2. Apply the necessary operations to each object based on the transformation pattern (e.g., move, scale, hollow, copy, recolor).\n3. Align the objects with respect to each other and the background color.\n4. Sort the objects based on their size and position.\n5. Remove any redundant or unnecessary objects.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to manipulate the objects in the input sequence according to the given rules, while taking into account their positions, sizes, and colors. The goal is to produce an output sequence where each pixel has a unique color and is properly aligned with respect to its neighbors.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and make it the new input sequence.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties.\n3. Apply the necessary operations to each object based on the transformation pattern.\n4. Align the objects with respect to each other and the background color.\n5. Sort the objects based on their size and position.\n6. Remove any redundant or unnecessary objects.\n7. Output the resulting sequence as the new output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how to perform the transformation for the given input sequence:\n\n1. **Input:** Copy the input sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n2. **Object Description:** There are 4 objects in the input sequence:\n\t* Object 1: Size = 2, Position = [0, 0], Color = 1\n\t* Object 2: Size = 1, Position = [1, 0], Color = 1\n\t* Object 3: Size = 1, Position = [2, 0], Color = 1\n\t* Object 4: Size = 2, Position = [3, 0], Color = 3\n3. **Transformed Objects:** After applying the transformation pattern, the objects will have the following properties:\n\t* Object 1: Size = 2, Position = [0, 0], Color = 1\n\t* Object 2: Size = 1, Position = [1, 0], Color = 1\n\t* Object 3: Size = 1, Position = [2, 0], Color = 1\n\t* Object 4: Size = 2, Position = [3, 0], Color = 3\n4. **Alignment:** Align the objects with respect to each other and the background color. In this case, there is no need to align the objects since they are already properly positioned.\n5. **Sorting:** Sort the objects based on their size and position. Since the objects are already sorted, we don't need to do anything here.\n6. **Removal:** Remove any redundant or unnecessary objects. Since there are only 4 objects in the input sequence, none of them can be removed.\n7. **Output:** The resulting sequence after transformation is the output sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for the given input sequence is:\n\nInput \u2192 Objects \u2192 Transformed Objects \u2192 Alignment \u2192 Sorting \u2192 Removal \u2192 Output\n\nI hope this helps!
