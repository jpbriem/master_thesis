            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn each input sequence, there are several groups of adjacent pixels that have the same color. These groups can be considered as objects. In the given input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the objects are:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 4}\n* Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nBased on the given transformation pattern, we need to apply various operations to the objects in the input sequence. For example, in the first input sequence [5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the object {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3} is moved two positions to the right (i.e., from index 1 to index 3). Similarly, the object {color: 9, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1} is shifted one position downward (from index 6 to index 7).\n\nStep 3: Update the output sequence\n\nAfter applying the transformations to the objects, we update the output sequence accordingly. For example, in the first input sequence [5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nBased on these steps, here's how I would transform the given input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\n* Object 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 4}\n* Object 2: {color: 9, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\n* Object 1: Move two positions to the right (from index 0 to index 4)\n* Object 2: Shift one position downward (from index 8 to index 7)\n\nStep 3: Update the output sequence\n\n* Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
