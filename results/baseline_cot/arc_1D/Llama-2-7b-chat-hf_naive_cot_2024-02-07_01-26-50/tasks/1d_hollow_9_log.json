            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move object 1 to the second position.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 is located at index 0, while in the output sequence, it is located at index 1. To achieve this, simply shift the entire input sequence one position to the right. So, the updated input sequence would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nStep 2: Scale object 1 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 has a size of 1x1 pixels. In the output sequence, object 1 has a size of 2x2 pixels. To achieve this, simply multiply each element of the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. So, the updated input sequence would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nStep 3: Remove object 2 from the input sequence.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 2 is located at index 4. Since we want to remove it, we simply delete the element at index 4 from the input sequence. So, the updated input sequence would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nStep 4: Recolor object 1 to have a red color (value = 3).\n\nIn the input sequence, object 1 has a color value of 1. In the output sequence, object 1 has a color value of 3. To achieve this, simply replace each element of the input sequence with the corresponding element of the output sequence, but with the color value replaced by 3. So, the updated input sequence would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nStep 5: Move object 3 to the last position.\n\nIn the input sequence, object 3 is located at index 7. In the output sequence, object 3 is located at index 8. To achieve this, simply shift the entire input sequence one position to the right. So, the updated input sequence would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nAnd that's it! By following these steps, we can transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence."
