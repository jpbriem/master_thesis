The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move Objects\nIn each input sequence, there are one or more objects that need to be moved according to some rule. In the given examples, the objects are moved by a fixed amount (either 1 or 2 positions) in the x-direction. Therefore, the first step is to move each object in the input sequence by the appropriate number of positions in the x-direction.\n\nStep 2: Scale Objects\nAfter moving the objects, the next step is to scale them by a factor that depends on their color. In the given examples, the objects are scaled by a factor of 2 if they are red, and by a factor of 3 if they are blue. Therefore, for each object in the input sequence, we need to calculate its scaling factor based on its color, and then apply that scaling factor to the object.\n\nStep 3: Remove Objects\nSome objects in the input sequence may need to be removed depending on their color and position. In the given examples, the green objects are removed if they are located at position 4 or 5. Therefore, for each position in the input sequence, we need to check whether any green objects are present, and if so, remove them from the sequence.\n\nStep 4: Recolor Objects\nFinally, we need to recolor some of the remaining objects in the input sequence based on their color and position. In the given examples, the yellow objects are recolored to blue if they are located at position 2 or 3, and the orange objects are recolored to red if they are located at position 4 or 5. Therefore, for each position in the input sequence, we need to check whether any yellow or orange objects are present, and if so, recolor them accordingly.\n\nWith these steps, we can transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence. Here's an example of how to apply these steps to the given input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Step 1: Move objects - None of the objects in the input sequence need to be moved, since they are already at the correct position.\n* Step 2: Scale objects - The red objects in the input sequence are scaled by a factor of 2, while the blue objects are scaled by a factor of 3.\n* Step 3: Remove objects - None of the objects in the input sequence need to be removed, since none of them are green.\n* Step 4: Recolor objects - None of the objects in the input sequence need to be recolored, since none of them are yellow or orange.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence is simply the original input sequence with no changes made to it.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
