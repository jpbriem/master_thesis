You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are specified in the output sequence.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding consecutive pixels of the same color.
2. Determine the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence.
3. Scale each object by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.
4. Shift each object horizontally by one pixel to the right.
5. Remove any noise pixels (i.e., pixels with a value of 0) from the input sequence.
6. Copy the remaining objects from the input sequence to the output sequence, along with their updated positions, sizes, and colors.

Here's an example of how these steps would be applied to the given input sequence:

Input sequence: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects:

Object 1: {color: 4, start index: 1, end index: 2, size: 2}
Object 2: {color: 8, start index: 4, end index: 6, size: 3}

Step 2: Determine the size, position, and color of each object in the input sequence. For Object 1, the size is 2, the position is (1, 2), and the color is 4. For Object 2, the size is 3, the position is (4, 5), and the color is 8.

Step 3: Scale each object by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions. This means that Object 1 will be scaled to twice its original size, and Object 2 will be scaled to three times its original size.

Step 4: Shift each object horizontally by one pixel to the right. This means that Object 1 will be shifted to the position (1, 3), and Object 2 will be shifted to the position (4, 6).

Step 5: Remove any noise pixels from the input sequence. Since there are no noise pixels in this sequence, this step is skipped.

Step 6: Copy the remaining objects from the input sequence to the output sequence, along with their updated positions, sizes, and colors. The output sequence will be:

Output sequence: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

As you can see, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed into larger versions of themselves in the output sequence, while maintaining their original positions and colors.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
