The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of alternating pixels of color 0 (background) and color 8 (object). The output sequence also consists of alternating pixels of color 0 and color 8, but with each object being larger than before. Specifically, the size of each object increases by 1 pixel in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of a single large object of color 8 surrounded by smaller objects of color 0. The output sequence consists of multiple small objects of color 8 scattered throughout the sequence, with each object having a similar size and shape as the original large object.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of a single large object of color 8 surrounded by smaller objects of color 0. However, unlike Example 2, there are no gaps between the objects in this sequence. Instead, the objects overlap and form a continuous pattern.\n\nBased on these examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves resizing and rearranging objects in the input sequence to create a new output sequence with more complex patterns.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to resize and rearrange the objects in the sequence while maintaining their relative positions and sizes. Here's one way to do this:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nIn this output sequence, each object has been resized by a factor of 2 in both the horizontal and vertical directions, while maintaining its original position and color. This results in a more complex pattern with overlapping objects, similar to Example 3.\n\nTherefore, the overall pattern for transforming an input sequence into its output sequence appears to involve resizing and rearranging objects in the input sequence while maintaining their relative positions and sizes, leading to more complex patterns in the output sequence."
