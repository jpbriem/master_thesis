The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are specified in the output sequence.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions, sizes, and colors.\n2. Move each object to its corresponding position in the output sequence.\n3. Scale each object to its correct size in the output sequence.\n4. Remove any duplicate objects in the output sequence.\n5. Add noise pixels to the output sequence to maintain the desired length.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation of each step:\n\n1. **Identify objects and their positions**: In the input sequence, we identify objects by finding consecutive pixels of the same color. We store the starting index and ending index of each object, as well as its size (i.e., the difference between the ending index and starting index). For example, in the input sequence `[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]`, there are two objects:\n\t* Object 1: Start index=1, End index=3, Size=2.\n\t* Object 2: Start index=4, End index=4, Size=1.\n2. **Move objects to their positions in the output sequence**: Once we know the positions of the objects in the input sequence, we move them to their corresponding positions in the output sequence. For example, in the output sequence `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]`, the first object (starting at index 1 in the input sequence) is moved to index 0 in the output sequence, and so on.\n3. **Scale objects to their correct sizes in the output sequence**: After moving the objects to their positions in the output sequence, we need to scale them to their correct sizes. This is because the objects in the output sequence are larger than those in the input sequence. For example, in the output sequence `[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]`, the first object (which has a size of 2 in the input sequence) is scaled up to a size of 3 in the output sequence.\n4. **Remove duplicate objects in the output sequence**: Since the objects in the output sequence are larger than those in the input sequence, some duplicates may appear in the output sequence. To avoid this, we simply remove any duplicate objects in the output sequence. For example, if there are two identical objects in the output sequence, we remove one of them.\n5. **Add noise pixels to maintain the desired length**: Finally, we add noise pixels to the output sequence to maintain its desired length. This is necessary because the objects in the output sequence are larger than those in the input sequence, so they take up more space. By adding noise pixels, we ensure that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.\n\nSo, the overall transformation pattern for the given input and output sequences is:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`\n\nNote that the output sequence has a length of 16, while the input sequence has a length of 10. This means that we added 6 noise pixels to the output sequence to maintain its desired length."
