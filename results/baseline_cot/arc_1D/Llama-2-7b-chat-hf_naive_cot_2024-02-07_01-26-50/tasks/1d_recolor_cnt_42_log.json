The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects: Object 1 (color = 2) and Object 2 (color = 3).\n\nStep 2: Determine the positions of each object in the input sequence. For Object 1, the starting index is 1, ending index is 2, and size is 2. For Object 2, the starting index is 4, ending index is 4, and size is 1.\n\nStep 3: Apply the necessary transformations to each object based on the given logic rules. For Object 1, we need to move it 2 positions to the right, scale it by a factor of 2 horizontally, and remove one pixel at the beginning. For Object 2, we need to move it 3 positions to the left, scale it by a factor of 3 horizontally, and remove one pixel at the end.\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 2-3 for each object in the input sequence until no more objects remain.\n\nStep 5: Finally, apply noise pixels to the output sequence to make it look more natural.\n\nHere's the detailed transformation process for the given input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nObject 1:\n\n* Starting index: 1\n* Ending index: 2\n* Size: 2\n* Transformations: Move 2 positions to the right, scale horizontally by a factor of 2, remove one pixel at the beginning\n\nObject 2:\n\n* Starting index: 4\n* Ending index: 4\n* Size: 1\n* Transformations: Move 3 positions to the left, scale horizontally by a factor of 3, remove one pixel at the end\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the output sequence has a length of 10, which is twice the length of the input sequence. This suggests that the transformation pattern may involve duplicating some elements in the input sequence, which is consistent with the given logic rules."
