[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the task involves transforming an input sequence of pixels into an output sequence of pixels, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (inclusive). The transformation appears to follow a simple pattern, where adjacent pixels of the same color are combined into a single object. The objects can undergo various transformations, such as moving, scaling, and removing, while maintaining their color and position information.

To solve this problem, I will provide a detailed description of the transformation process, along with the necessary instructions and transformation rules. Please note that these descriptions are based on the given input-output pairs and may not generalize to more complex scenarios.

**Description of Transformation Process:**

1. **Color Identification:** Each pixel in the input sequence is assigned a unique color value between 1 and 9. We identify the colors of adjacent pixels and group them into objects based on their color similarity.
2. **Object Creation:** For each identified color, we create a new object in the output sequence. The object's size is determined by the number of pixels sharing the same color.
3. **Object Transformations:** Depending on the type of object, we apply the following transformations:
	* **Move:** Move the object to a random position within the output sequence.
	* **Hollow:** Remove the object from the output sequence.
	* **Scale:** Rescale the object by a random factor between 0.5 and 2.
	* **Remove:** Remove the object from the output sequence.
	* **Copy:** Copy the object to a random position within the output sequence.
	* **Recolor:** Change the object's color to a randomly selected color between 1 and 9.
4. **Alignment and Overlap:** Check for any overlapping objects in the output sequence and align them accordingly.
5. **Distance Calculation:** Calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of objects in the output sequence.
6. **Sorting:** Sort the objects in the output sequence based on their distances.

**Instructions for Transforming a New Input:**

1. Initialize the output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence.
3. For each pixel, check if it belongs to an existing object in the output sequence. If it does, apply the appropriate transformation rule to the object.
4. If the pixel does not belong to an existing object, create a new object in the output sequence and apply the appropriate transformation rule to it.
5. Update the positions and sizes of all objects in the output sequence based on the transformation applied to the current pixel.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all pixels in the input sequence have been processed.

**Transformation Rules:**

1. **Move:** Randomly select a destination position for the object within the output sequence.
2. **Hollow:** Remove the object from the output sequence.
3. **Scale:** Rescale the object by a random factor between 0.5 and 2.
4. **Remove:** Remove the object from the output sequence.
5. **Copy:** Copy the object to a random position within the output sequence.
6. **Recolor:** Change the object's color to a randomly selected color between 1 and 9.
7. **Distance Calculation:** Calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of objects in the output sequence.
8. **Sorting:** Sort the objects in the output sequence based on their distances.

I hope this helps you understand the transformation process and how to transform a new input into its corresponding output. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
