The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also consists of 10 elements. All elements in the output sequence are copies of the corresponding elements in the input sequence, except for the last element, which is shifted one position to the right.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also consists of 10 elements. All elements in the output sequence are identical to their corresponding elements in the input sequence, except for the last element, which is shifted two positions to the right.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also consists of 10 elements. All elements in the output sequence are identical to their corresponding elements in the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves shifting elements in the output sequence relative to their corresponding elements in the input sequence. Specifically, each element in the output sequence is shifted one position to the right compared to its corresponding element in the input sequence.\n\nNow, let's consider the test case provided:\n\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the observed transformation pattern. That is, we need to shift each element in the output sequence one position to the right compared to its corresponding element in the input sequence. Here's the resulting output sequence:\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs requested, here are the descriptions for each field:\n\n* description: This field contains a brief description of the transformation pattern observed in the input-output pairs provided.\n* overall_pattern: This field describes the general pattern observed in the input-output pairs, which involves shifting elements in the output sequence relative to their corresponding elements in the input sequence.\n* instructions: This field provides detailed instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the observed transformation pattern. In this case, the instruction is simply to apply the shift operation to each element in the output sequence relative to its corresponding element in the input sequence.\n* transformation: This field contains a description of the transformation action required to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence. As mentioned earlier, the transformation involves applying a shift operation to each element in the output sequence relative to its corresponding element in the input sequence.\n* test_output: This field contains the resulting test output sequence after applying the transformation.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
