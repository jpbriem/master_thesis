The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. All elements in both sequences are either 0 or 5, indicating that there are 5 objects in the input sequence. The objects are evenly distributed throughout the sequence, and each object has a size of 5.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 12 elements, and the output sequence also has 12 elements. All elements in both sequences are either 0 or 2, indicating that there are 2 objects in the input sequence. The objects are aligned horizontally in the input sequence, and their sizes are equal to 2.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 elements, and the output sequence also has 8 elements. All elements in both sequences are either 0 or 4, indicating that there are 4 objects in the input sequence. The objects are scattered randomly throughout the input sequence, and their sizes are unequal.\n\nBased on these observations, I can make the following assumptions about the input-output relationship:\n\n1. The number of objects in the input sequence is consistent across all examples.\n2. The size of each object in the input sequence is consistent across all examples.\n3. The positions of the objects in the input sequence are randomized.\n4. The noise pixels in the input sequence are equally distributed.\n\nNow, let's consider a new input sequence [9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Using the above assumptions, we can apply the following transformation steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are 9 objects.\n\nStep 2: Determine the size of each object. Since the size of each object is consistent across all examples, we can assume that each object has a size of 9.\n\nStep 3: Randomize the positions of the objects in the input sequence. This ensures that the objects are scattered randomly throughout the sequence.\n\nStep 4: Apply arithmetics based on the objects. Since the objects are evenly distributed throughout the sequence, we can apply arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication to them without affecting their relative positions. For instance, we can add 3 to each object, resulting in [9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nStep 5: Repeat Step 4 until no further changes occur. After applying the operation multiple times, the output sequence will be obtained.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence for the given input sequence is [9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nFinally, here is the requested JSON data structure containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, and transformation:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. Precise attention should be paid to what changed and how.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Input sequence consists of N objects, where each object has a fixed size and position. Arithmetic operations are applied to the objects, followed by randomization of their positions.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Transform a new input sequence by identifying its objects, determining their sizes, and applying arithmetic operations. Repeat until no further changes occur.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[Copy the test case input sequence from the task.]\",\n\"object_description\": \"[Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.]\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"[Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.]\",\n\"output\": \"[Create the resulting test output sequence.]\"\n}\n\"test_output\": \"[Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format.]\"\n}"
