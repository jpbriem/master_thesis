[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 7), while the output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 7) as well. There is no apparent pattern in the input sequence that could explain why some pixels are non-zero. Therefore, it seems that the transformation rule is simply copying the input sequence without any modification.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 4), while the output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 4) as well. Again, there is no apparent pattern in the input sequence that could explain why some pixels are non-zero. It appears that the transformation rule is also simply copying the input sequence without any modification.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 2), while the output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 2) as well. This time, there is an obvious pattern in the input sequence - every other pixel is non-zero. Therefore, the transformation rule must involve some sort of alternating pattern.

Now, let's consider the given test case input sequence:

input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the patterns observed in the previous examples, it seems likely that the transformation rule for this input sequence involves some sort of alternating pattern similar to Example_3. However, since we don't know the exact transformation rule yet, we cannot determine the output sequence with certainty.

To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we can try applying an alternating pattern involving the colors 0 and 2. Here's one possible approach:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence:
a. If the current pixel value is 0, set the corresponding output pixel value to 2.
b. Otherwise, set the output pixel value to 0.
3. Return the resulting output sequence.

Here's the transformed output sequence using this approach:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As expected, the transformed output sequence has the same pattern as the input sequence, but with all pixels having the opposite color. This suggests that the transformation rule is indeed an alternating pattern involving the colors 0 and 2.

Therefore, the overall pattern for transforming an input sequence into its output sequence appears to be:

input: [0, 0,..., 0, 2,..., 2]
output: [0, 0,..., 0, 2,..., 2]

where each pixel value is either 0 or 2, and the number of pixels with each value alternates between consecutive inputs.

Finally, here is the requested JSON data structure containing the description, overall pattern, transformation, and test output:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
"Example_2": "..."
},
"overall_pattern": "Describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
"transformation": {
"input": "[copy the test case input sequence from the task]",
"object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color",
"transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color",
"output": "Create the resulting test output sequence."
},
"test_output": "[return the created test output sequence in numpy array format.]"
}
