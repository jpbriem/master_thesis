            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will infer the simplest possible relation between input and output and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nRelation Between Input and Output:\nAfter analyzing the given input-output pairs, I observe that there is a consistent pattern in the transformation of the input sequence into the output sequence. The pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, rotating, and recoloring objects. These operations are applied in a specific order, with each operation affecting only a subset of the objects in the input sequence.\n\nTransformation Steps:\nTo transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence, I will follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Move all objects in the input sequence one position to the right.\n\nStep 2: Scale all objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\n\nStep 3: Rotate all objects in the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nStep 4: Recolor all objects in the input sequence to have a color value of 7.\n\nStep 5: Remove any remaining noise pixels in the input sequence.\n\nStep 6: Copy the transformed input sequence to create the output sequence.\n\nObject Description:\nRegarding the test input, there are three objects in the sequence:\n\nObject 1: Size = 7, Position = (4, 4), Color = 7\nObject 2: Size = 7, Position = (8, 8), Color = 7\nObject 3: Size = 1, Position = (10, 10), Color = 0\n\nTransformed Objects:\nAfter applying the transformation steps, the transformed objects in the output sequence would have the following properties:\n\nObject 1: Size = 7, Position = (4, 4), Color = 7\nObject 2: Size = 7, Position = (8, 8), Color = 7\nObject 3: Size = 1, Position = (10, 10), Color = 7\n\nOutput Sequence:\nThe resulting test output sequence would be:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nInstructions:\nPlease provide the actual input sequence for me to perform the transformation."
