            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn each input sequence, there are several distinct objects (i.e., clusters of consecutive pixels with the same color) that can be identified. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the objects are:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 0, start index: 0, end index: 3, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 1, start index: 4, end index: 5, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 3, start index: 6, end index: 7, size: 2}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nBased on the given transformation pattern, it appears that the objects in the input sequence will undergo various transformations, including moving, scaling, and recoloring. For instance, in the output sequence for the input `[[0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`, object 1 is moved two positions to the right, while object 2 is scaled up by a factor of 2 and recolored to green.\n\nStep 3: Update the positions and sizes of the objects\n\nAfter applying the transformations, the positions and sizes of the objects may change. For example, in the output sequence for the input `[[0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`, object 1 has moved two positions to the right, so its start index is now 2 instead of 0. Similarly, object 2 has been scaled up by a factor of 2, so its size is now 4 instead of 2.\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until no further changes occur\n\nFinally, repeat steps 1-3 until no further changes occur in the input sequence after applying the transformations. This will result in the desired output sequence.\n\nHere's an example of how this process could be applied to the input sequence `[[0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`:\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence\n\n* Object 1: {color: 0, start index: 0, end index: 3, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 1, start index: 4, end index: 5, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 3, start index: 6, end index: 7, size: 2}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nObject 1 moves two positions to the right.\nObject 2 scales up by a factor of 2 and recolors to green.\n\nStep 3: Update the positions and sizes of the objects\n\n* Object 1: {color: 0, start index: 2, end index: 5, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 1, start index: 6, end index: 9, size: 4}\n* Object 3: {color: 3, start index: 10, end index: 11, size: 2}\n\nRepeat steps 1-3 until no further changes occur.\n\nOutput sequence: `[0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nNote that this is just one possible way to apply these transformations to the input sequence. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem, additional transformations may need to be applied or different approaches may be necessary."
