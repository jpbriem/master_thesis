The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, rotating, and merging objects.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences, and then apply the necessary transformations to transform the input sequence into the output sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence horizontally by one pixel.\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions.\n3. Rotate the objects in the input sequence by 90 degrees clockwise.\n4. Merge any two adjacent objects in the input sequence if they have the same color.\n5. Remove any object in the input sequence that has no neighboring objects of the same color.\n6. Repeat steps 1-5 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence.\n7. Output the resulting sequence of colors.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and remove any leading or trailing zeros.\n2. Apply the moves specified in step 1 of the overall pattern to the input sequence.\n3. Apply the scales specified in step 2 of the overall pattern to the input sequence.\n4. Apply the rotation specified in step 3 of the overall pattern to the input sequence.\n5. Apply the merges specified in step 4 of the overall pattern to the input sequence.\n6. Remove any objects specified in step 5 of the overall pattern.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence.\n8. Output the resulting sequence of colors.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how to perform the transformation for the given input sequence:\n\n1. Input: `[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`\n2. Move the objects horizontally by one pixel:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n```\n3. Scale the objects by a factor of 2 in both directions:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]\n```\n4. Rotate the objects by 90 degrees clockwise:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15]\n```\n5. Merge any two adjacent objects in the input sequence if they have the same color:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]\n```\n6. Remove any object in the input sequence that has no neighboring objects of the same color:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n```\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence:\n```markdown\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n```\nFinally, output the resulting sequence of colors:\n```markdown\n['0', '0', '5', '0', '0', '5', '0', '0', '0', '5', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5']\n```\n\nTherefore, the transformation from the input sequence to its output sequence is:\n```markdown\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\nOutput: ['0', '0', '5', '0', '0', '5', '0', '0', '0', '5', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5, '5']\n```"
