You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output and then transform a new input into its corresponding output.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of zeros and ones, with one object (Object_1) present in the middle. The output sequence also consists of zeros and ones, but with an additional object (Object_2) at the end. It seems that the presence of an object in the input sequence results in the creation of a similar object in the output sequence.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of zeros and ones, with multiple objects present throughout the sequence. The output sequence again consists of zeros and ones, but with some objects removed and others moved around. It appears that the positions of the objects in the input sequence affect their positions in the output sequence.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of zeros and ones, with several objects present. The output sequence consists of zeros and ones as well, but with some objects removed and others moved around. It seems that the size and position of the objects in the input sequence influence their appearance in the output sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation rule between input and output can be summarized as follows:

1. If there are no objects in the input sequence, there will be no objects in the output sequence either.
2. If there is exactly one object in the input sequence, it will be duplicated in the output sequence.
3. If there are multiple objects in the input sequence, they will be moved around according to some rule (which is not specified in the problem statement).
4. The size and position of each object in the input sequence will affect its appearance in the output sequence.

Now, let's apply these rules to a new input sequence:

Input sequence: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Using the above rules, we can transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:

Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]

As you can see, the input sequence has been transformed into an output sequence with more objects present, and the positions of these objects have been affected by the rules mentioned earlier.

Finally, here is the requested JSON data structure containing the description of the transformation process:

{
"description": {
"Example_1": "In Example_1, the presence of an object in the input sequence results in the creation of a similar object in the output sequence.",
"Example_2": "In Example_2, the positions of the objects in the input sequence affect their positions in the output sequence.",
"Example_3": "In Example_3, the size and position of the objects in the input sequence influence their appearance in the output sequence."
},
"overall_pattern": "Transform input sequence by creating new objects, moving existing objects, and adjusting their sizes and positions based on the rules provided.",
"instructions": "Apply the following steps to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:
1. Check if the input sequence contains any objects. If yes, create a new object in the output sequence with the same properties as the input object. Otherwise, proceed to step 2.
2. Move each object in the input sequence to a random position in the output sequence.
3. Adjust the size of each object in the output sequence based on the size of the corresponding object in the input sequence.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no further changes occur.",
"transformation": {
"input": "Copy the input sequence",
"object_description": "For each object in the input sequence, describe its properties as follows: size, position, color. For example, Object_1: {size: 5, position: [0, 0], color: 2}.",
"transformed_objects": "For each object in the output sequence, describe its properties as follows: size, position, color. For example, Object_1: {size: 5, position: [0, 0], color: 2}.",
"output": "Create the resulting output sequence"
}
}

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
