The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has one of nine possible values (0-8) representing different colors. The input and output sequences may also contain \"noise\" pixels, which are pixels that do not belong to any object.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: Based on the given examples, it appears that objects are defined as contiguous sequences of pixels that have the same color. In the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], there are two objects: Object 1 consists of pixels 0-2, and Object 2 consists of pixels 4-7.\n2. Determine the transformation rules for each object: From the given examples, we can observe that the transformation rules involve various operations such as moving, scaling, copying, and recoloring. For instance, in Example 1, Object 1 is moved two positions to the right, while Object 2 is scaled up by a factor of 2.\n3. Apply the transformation rules to the input sequence: Using the rules determined in step 2, apply the necessary transformations to the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence. For example, applying the transformation rules to the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n\nBased on these steps, here is the transformation pattern for the given input-output pairs:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nInput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nInput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFor the test case, the input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Applying the transformation rules, we get the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this problem is:\n\nInput: [0, 0,..., 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0,..., 0, 0]\n\nwhere each input sequence contains objects defined as contiguous sequences of pixels that have the same color, and the transformation rules involve moving, scaling, copying, and recoloring the objects."
