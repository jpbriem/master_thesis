You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:

Step 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2

In the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the output sequence starts at index 0, we need to move Object 1 to position 2 in the output sequence. To do this, we simply shift the entire object to the right by 2 positions in the output sequence.

Step 2: Scale Object 2 by a Factor of 2

In the input sequence, Object 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. We need to scale this object by a factor of 2 in both dimensions (width and height) to make it larger in the output sequence. To do this, we can simply multiply each element of the object by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.

Step 3: Remove Object 3

In the input sequence, there is no Object 3. In the output sequence, however, there is an empty space at index 7 where Object 3 used to be. To create this empty space in the output sequence, we simply set all elements of the output sequence at index 7 to 0.

Step 4: Recolor Object 1

In the input sequence, Object 1 has a color of 5. In the output sequence, Object 1 has a color of 9 instead. To achieve this change in color, we simply replace each element of Object 1 in the input sequence with the corresponding element of Object 1 in the output sequence, but with a color value of 9 instead of 5.

Step 5: Sort the Remaining Elements

After applying the above operations, we are left with a sorted output sequence. Specifically, the remaining elements in the output sequence are sorted in ascending order based on their color values.

Therefore, the transformed output sequence would be:

[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]

Note that the length of the output sequence is the same as the length of the input sequence, since we did not modify any of the non-object elements in the input sequence.
