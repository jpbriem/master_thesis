The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zero values, while the output sequence also consists of alternating zeros and non-zero values but with some modifications. Specifically, some of the non-zero values in the input sequence have been replaced by larger non-zero values in the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zero values, while the output sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zero values but with some modifications. Specifically, some of the non-zero values in the input sequence have been replaced by smaller non-zero values in the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zero values, while the output sequence consists of alternating zeros and non-zero values but with some modifications. Specifically, some of the non-zero values in the input sequence have been replaced by larger non-zero values in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these observations to the given test case input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can expect the output sequence to consist of alternating zeros and non-zero values, where some of the non-zero values in the input sequence may be replaced by larger non-zero values in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation action for the given test case input sequence would be:\n\nTransformed objects:\n\n* Object 1: Replace value 7 in the input sequence with a larger value (e.g., 8).\n* Object 2: Replace value 3 in the input sequence with a smaller value (e.g., 2).\n\nNew output sequence:\n```json\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that this transformation action is just one possible way to transform the input sequence into its output sequence based on the patterns observed in the previous examples. There may be other valid transformation actions depending on the specific requirements of the problem."
