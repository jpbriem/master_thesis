The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 5, while the output sequence has all values set to 9. Additionally, there are no noise pixels in either sequence.\n\nExample_2:\nInput: `[0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]`\n\nSimilar to Example_1, this input sequence also consists of alternating values of 0 and 5, while the output sequence has all values set to 9.\n\nExample_3:\nInput: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this input sequence, there are no objects, and all values are either 0 or 5. The output sequence has all values set to 9.\n\nNow, based on these observations, I will attempt to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are no objects since all values are either 0 or 5.\n\nStep 2: Determine the transformation actions required to transform each object in the input sequence into its corresponding object in the output sequence. Since there are no objects in the input sequence, this step does not apply.\n\nStep 3: Apply the transformation actions identified in Step 2 to each object in the input sequence. Again, since there are no objects in the input sequence, this step does not apply.\n\nStep 4: Sort the transformed objects in the output sequence according to their positions in the original input sequence. This step does not apply since there are no objects in the input sequence.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the count of each object in the output sequence and store it in the appropriate location in the output sequence. This step does not apply since there are no objects in the input sequence.\n\nStep 6: Repeat Steps 1-5 for each input sequence until the desired output sequence is obtained.\n\nBased on the above analysis and steps, I will now transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Please provide the input sequence, and I will update this answer accordingly."
