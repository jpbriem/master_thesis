The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 11 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. Each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the corresponding pixel in the input sequence is white (0) or black (1). There are no objects in the input sequence, and there are no noise pixels. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple bitwise XOR operation.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of 11 pixels, and the output sequence has the same number of pixels. However, in this case, each pixel value in the output sequence is either 0 or 8, indicating whether the corresponding pixel in the input sequence is white (0) or black (8). Again, there are no objects in the input sequence, and there are no noise pixels. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is another simple bitwise operation, i.e., a bitwise AND operation.\n* Example_3: This is the most complex input-output pair provided, with 7 objects and 1 noise pixel. The input sequence consists of 9 pixels, and the output sequence has 9 pixels as well. Each object in the input sequence has a specific color (0-8), and the noise pixel has a value of 0. The simplest possible relation between input and output is a combination of several bitwise operations, including bitwise OR, AND, and XOR operations, along with some arithmetic operations to count the number of pixels in each object and align them properly.\n\nNow, let's apply these transformations to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the given transformation actions, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Move the first two pixels to the right by one position each, so that they become [2, 2].\n2. Scale the next three pixels up by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions, so that they become [4, 6].\n3. Remove the last two pixels from the sequence.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more pixels left in the sequence.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, the resulting output sequence would be:\n\nOutput sequence: [2, 2, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation action for this input sequence is:\n\n{\n\"move\": [2],\n\"scale\": [4],\n\"remove\": [2],\n\"repeate\": []\n}\n\nNote that the repeat operation is not necessary in this case, since there are no more pixels left in the input sequence after applying the other transformation actions."
