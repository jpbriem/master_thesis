prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

Example 1:
Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

From this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 5, with no other values present. The output sequence also consists of alternating values of 0 and 5, but with no gaps between them. This suggests that the simplest possible relation between input and output is simply copying the input sequence without any modification.

Example 2:
Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

From this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 2, with some additional values present at indices 3, 7, and 9. The output sequence also consists of alternating values of 0 and 2, but with no additional values present. This suggests that the simplest possible relation between input and output is again simply copying the input sequence without any modification.

Example 3:
Input: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

From this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 2, with some additional values present at indices 7 and 6. The output sequence also consists of alternating values of 0 and 2, but with no additional values present. This suggests that the simplest possible relation between input and output is again simply copying the input sequence without any modification.

Now, let us apply these insights to a new input sequence:

Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Based on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can conclude that the simplest possible relation between this input sequence and its corresponding output sequence is simply copying the input sequence without any modification. Therefore, the output sequence for this input sequence would be:

Output: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Therefore, the transformation rule for this problem is:

Transformation: Copy the input sequence without any modification.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
