The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are grouped together based on their color. The objects are also aligned horizontally. In the output sequence, each object is represented by a unique number (0-8) indicating its color. The objects are also aligned horizontally, but the colors are now represented by numbers instead of actual colors.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, the objects in the input sequence are again grouped together based on their color. However, there is one additional rule - if two objects have the same color, they are moved closer to each other. This rule is applied recursively until no more movements are possible. In the output sequence, each object is represented by a unique number (0-8) indicating its color. As before, the objects are aligned horizontally.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can infer that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is to assign a unique number to each object in the input sequence based on its color. The objects are then aligned horizontally in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\nOutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs requested, here is the description of the transformation actions required to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\n* Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n* Assign a unique number to each object in the input sequence based on its color.\n* Align the objects horizontally in the output sequence.\n\nFinally, here is the JSON response with the desired information:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. Be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n\"Example_2\": \"...\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Assign a unique number to each object in the input sequence based on its color, align objects horizontally in the output sequence.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence by applying the above pattern. Think step by step.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": \"[Copy the test case input sequence from the task.]\",\n\"object_description\": \"[Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.]\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"[Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.]\",\n\"output\": \"[Create the resulting test output sequence.]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": \"[Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format.]\"\n}"
