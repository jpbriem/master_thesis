You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

Example_1:
Input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

From this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of alternating values of 0 and 9, while the output sequence has a repeating pattern of 3's followed by a repeating pattern of 9's. Additionally, there are no noise pixels in either sequence.

Example_2:
Input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Similar to Example_1, this input sequence also consists of alternating values of 0 and 9, while the output sequence has a repeating pattern of 3's followed by a repeating pattern of 9's.

Example_3:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]

In this input sequence, all the values are 0 or 9, except for one value at index 5, which is 3. The output sequence has a repeating pattern of 3's followed by a repeating pattern of 9's.

Now, based on these observations, I will make an educated guess about the simplest possible relation between input and output. My hypothesis is that the transformation rule is simply a shift operation, where each value in the input sequence is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the output sequence. Specifically, I hypothesize that the shift amount is equal to the number of times the value appears in the input sequence.

Using this hypothesis, I can now transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Here's how I would do it:

Suppose the new input sequence is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j]. To transform this sequence into its output sequence, I would apply the following steps:

1. Shift the input sequence by 1 position to the right, so that the first element becomes the second element in the output sequence, and so on.
2. Replace each element in the output sequence with the number of times it appears in the input sequence. For example, if the input sequence contains the value a, then the output sequence will have a repeated 3 times, since a appears three times in the input sequence.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the entire input sequence has been transformed into the output sequence.

Here's an example of how this process would work for the new input sequence [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j]:

Input sequence: [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j]
Shift by 1 position to the right: [b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, a]
Replace each element with the number of times it appears in the input sequence: [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the entire input sequence has been transformed into the output sequence: [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Therefore, my transformed output sequence for the new input sequence [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j] is [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
