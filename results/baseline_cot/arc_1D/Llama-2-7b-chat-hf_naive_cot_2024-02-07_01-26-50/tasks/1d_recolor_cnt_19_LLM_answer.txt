You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6]
output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0]

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here are some observations and hypotheses about the transformation process:

* Pixels with the same color as the background (i.e., 0) remain unchanged in both the input and output sequences.
* Pixels with a color different from the background are either moved, resized, or recolored based on their relative positions and distances from other colored pixels.
* The distance between two adjacent pixels of the same color is used to determine the transformation operation (e.g., move, resize, recolor).
* The size of an object (i.e., a group of consecutive pixels with the same color) is preserved in the output sequence.
* The position of an object is shifted according to the distance between the object and the nearest edge of the image.

With these assumptions, we can propose a step-by-step transformation process for converting an input sequence of pixels into an output sequence:

Step 1: Initialize the output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.

Step 2: Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence, applying the appropriate transformation operation based on the color of the pixel and its spatial relationships with other pixels.

Step 3: If the transformed pixel has a color different from the background, update the corresponding element in the output sequence with the new color value. Otherwise, leave the element unchanged.

Step 4: Repeat Step 2 until all pixels in the input sequence have been processed.

Here are some more specific instructions for each step of the transformation process:

Step 1: Initialize the output sequence with zeros.

Step 2: For each pixel in the input sequence:
	* Check if the pixel has a color different from the background (i.e., 0). If so, apply the appropriate transformation operation based on the color of the pixel and its spatial relationships with other pixels.
	* Update the corresponding element in the output sequence with the new color value.
	* If the transformed pixel has a color different from the background, preserve its original position in the output sequence. Otherwise, shift the element towards the nearest edge of the image by a distance proportional to the distance between the pixel and the nearest edge.

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until all pixels in the input sequence have been processed.

Overall Pattern: Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. The exact nature of the transformation operations is not explicitly stated in the problem statement, but it seems likely that they involve some combination of moving, resizing, and recoloring pixels.

Instructions: To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow the steps outlined above. Pay close attention to the color values and spatial relationships between pixels, as these will determine the appropriate transformation operations to apply at each step.

Transformation: Copy the test input sequence from the task, mind the sequence length! Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color. Transform the objects in the input sequence according to the given transformation pattern, describing how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color. Create the resulting test output sequence, mind the sequence length!

Test Output: Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format, mind the sequence length!
