The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that there is a consistent pattern in the transformation of objects. Each object is either moved leftward or rightward by a fixed number of positions (equal to the value of the corresponding pixel), or it is removed if its position is equal to 0. Additionally, the noise pixels are simply copied without any modification.\n\nBased on this observation, I can propose the following transformation rule for the given input sequence:\n\nRule 1: If an object's position is non-zero, move it leftward or rightward by a fixed number of positions equal to the value of the corresponding pixel.\n\nNow, let us apply this rule to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nApplying Rule 1 to each object in the input sequence yields the following transformed sequence:\n\nTransformed Input: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nAs we can see, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed according to the proposed rule. Specifically, objects whose positions are non-zero have been moved leftward or rightward by a fixed number of positions equal to their respective pixel values.\n\nSimilarly, we can apply this rule to any other input sequence to obtain its corresponding output sequence.\n\nTherefore, my answer to the question is:\n\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'The input sequence is transformed by moving each object leftward or rightward by a fixed number of positions equal to the value of the corresponding pixel.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Move objects leftward or rightward by a fixed number of positions equal to the value of the corresponding pixel', 'instructions': 'Apply the above rule to each object in the input sequence to obtain the transformed output sequence', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence', 'object_description': 'For each object, check if its position is non-zero. If so, move it leftward or rightward by a fixed number of positions equal to the value of the corresponding pixel. Otherwise, do nothing.'}, 'test_output': 'Create a new test output sequence by applying the above rule to the input sequence.'},\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
