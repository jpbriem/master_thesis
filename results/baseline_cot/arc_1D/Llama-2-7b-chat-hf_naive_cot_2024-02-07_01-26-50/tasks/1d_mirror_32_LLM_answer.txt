You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their starting and ending indices in the sequence.

The transformation from input to output involves several logical rules that can be applied to the input sequence:

* Move an object by any positive integer amount (e.g., +1, +2, etc.) to a new position in the sequence.
* Remove an object entirely if its starting index is greater than or equal to its ending index.
* Scale an object by a factor (e.g., x2, x3, etc.) if its starting index is divisible by that factor without leaving a remainder.
* Copy an object exactly at its current position in the sequence.
* Recolor an object by changing its color to any value between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
* Overlap two objects if they have a non-zero intersection in the sequence.
* Containment checks whether one object completely contains another object in the sequence.

Based on these rules, we can derive the following instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the transformation rules to each object in turn.
3. For each object, update its position and size in the output sequence accordingly.
4. If an object is moved, removed, scaled, or recolored, update its starting and ending indices in the output sequence to reflect its new position and size.
5. If two objects overlap or one object contains another, update the positions and sizes of both objects in the output sequence to resolve the overlap or containment issue.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the entire input sequence has been processed.
7. Return the resulting output sequence.

Now, let's apply these instructions to the given test case input sequence:

Input: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Step 1: Initialize the output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.

Output: `[]`

Step 2: Iterate through the input sequence, applying the transformation rules to each object in turn.

Object 1: Move object 1 by +1 to position 1 in the output sequence.

Object 2: Remove object 2 since its starting index (4) is greater than or equal to its ending index (4).

Object 3: Scale object 3 by x2 since its starting index (2) is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder.

Object 4: Recolor object 4 to color 3.

Object 5: Overlap check: Check if object 5 overlaps with object 3. Since they do not overlap, no further action is required.

Object 6: Containment check: Check if object 6 contains object 5. Since object 6 does not contain object 5, no further action is required.

Step 3: Update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence accordingly.

Output: `[[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`

Step 4: Repeat steps 2-3 until the entire input sequence has been processed.

Final output: `[[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`

Therefore, the transformation rule for the given input sequence is to move object 1 by +1, remove object 2, scale object 3 by x2, recolor object 4 to color 3, and update the positions and sizes of the remaining objects in the output sequence accordingly.
