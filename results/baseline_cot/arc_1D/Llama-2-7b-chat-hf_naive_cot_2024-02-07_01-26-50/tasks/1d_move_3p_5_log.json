The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences share the same underlying transformation pattern, where each object (represented by a contiguous sequence of identical colors) is moved one position to the right in the output sequence. Additionally, any noise pixels (represented by a single 0 value in the middle of the sequence) are removed.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the input-output pairs is that objects are moved one position to the right in the output sequence, while noise pixels are removed.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding contiguous sequences of identical colors.\n2. Move each object one position to the right in the output sequence.\n3. Remove any noise pixels (represented by a single 0 value in the middle of the sequence).\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all objects have been moved to their correct positions in the output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\n* **Input**: Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n* **Object Description**: Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n\t+ Object 1: Size = 2, Position = 1, Color = 2\n\t+ Object 2: Size = 2, Position = 3, Color = 3\n* **Transformed Objects**: Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n\t+ Transformed Object 1: Size = 2, Position = 4, Color = 2\n\t+ Transformed Object 2: Size = 2, Position = 5, Color = 3\n* **Output**: Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\n**Test Output**\n\nReturn the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\n\nHere's the test output sequence for the given input:\n```json\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
