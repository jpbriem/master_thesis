The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom the output, we can see that the objects in the input sequence have been transformed in the following ways:\n\n* Object 1: The object at index 1 in the input sequence has been moved three positions to the right, resulting in a shift of three pixels.\n* Object 2: The object at index 3 in the input sequence has been scaled up by a factor of 3, resulting in a larger size.\n* Object 3: The object at index 5 in the input sequence has been aligned with the previous object, resulting in a continuous sequence of two objects.\n\nSimilarly, for Example_2:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]`\n\nIn this case, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed as follows:\n\n* Object 1: The object at index 1 in the input sequence has been moved one position to the left, resulting in a shift of one pixel.\n* Object 2: The object at index 3 in the input sequence has been scaled up by a factor of 3, resulting in a larger size.\n* Object 3: The object at index 5 in the input sequence has been aligned with the previous object, resulting in a continuous sequence of two objects.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to the given test case:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]`\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can make the following predictions about the transformation of the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: The object at index 1 in the input sequence will be moved three positions to the right, resulting in a shift of three pixels.\n* Object 2: The object at index 5 in the input sequence will be scaled up by a factor of 3, resulting in a larger size.\n* Object 3: The object at index 7 in the input sequence will be aligned with the previous object, resulting in a continuous sequence of two objects.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]`\n\nAs requested, here are the descriptions for each of the objects in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: {color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3}\nObject 2: {color: 5, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 3}\nObject 3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 3}\n\nFinally, here are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nTransform the input sequence by applying the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and position.\n2. Apply the necessary transformations to each object, such as moving, scaling, aligning, etc., based on the logic provided earlier.\n3. Repeat step 2 until all objects have been transformed.\n4. Concatenate the transformed objects to form the output sequence.\n\nNote that the length of the output sequence may vary depending on the length of the input sequence and the number of objects present in the input sequence."
