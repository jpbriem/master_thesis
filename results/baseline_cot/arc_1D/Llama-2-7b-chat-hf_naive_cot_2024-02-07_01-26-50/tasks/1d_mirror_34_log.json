            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and the transformation rule appears to involve logical operations on the pixel values, such as moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, containing, counting, and comparing.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the input sequence:\nInput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence:\nObjects: {Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 9, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}}\n3. Determine the transformation rule(s):\nThe transformation rule appears to involve logical operations on the pixel values, such as moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, containing, counting, and comparing. Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation rule can be represented as follows:\n\nTransformations:\nMove (2, 2) units to the right.\nScale (2, 2) times larger.\nAlign at position (4, 4).\nOverlap with Object_1.\nContain within Object_1.\nCount the number of non-background pixels.\nCompare with 9.\n\n4. Apply the transformation rule(s) to the input sequence:\nOutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Move (2, 2) units to the right: The first two pixels move two positions to the right, leaving behind a gap of two pixels.\n* Scale (2, 2) times larger: Each pixel is multiplied by 2, making the entire sequence twice as large.\n* Align at position (4, 4): The sequence is shifted so that the first pixel is aligned with the fourth pixel in the original sequence.\n* Overlap with Object_1: The sequence overlaps with Object_1, starting from the second pixel.\n* Contain within Object_1: Since the sequence contains Object_1, we need to adjust its size accordingly.\n* Count the number of non-background pixels: There are three non-background pixels in the sequence.\n* Compare with 9: Since the count is greater than or equal to 9, we set the last pixel to 9.\n\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 for any additional input sequences:\n\nFor example, if we apply the same transformation rule to the input sequence [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we get the output sequence [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n6. Return the transformed output sequence:\nThe transformed output sequence is [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is to apply the transformation rule to the input sequence, which involves moving, scaling, aligning, overlapping, containing, counting, and comparing the pixel values. By doing so, we can transform the input sequence into an equivalent output sequence that meets the desired criteria."
