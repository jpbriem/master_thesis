The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the objects seem to be moved, resized, and aligned with each other. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are three objects: Object 1 (size = 2), Object 2 (size = 6), and Object 3 (size = 6).\n\nStep 2: Move Object 1 to the second position in the input sequence. This means that the value of Object 1 will change from 0 to 6, and its starting index will become 1 instead of 0.\n\nStep 3: Resize Object 2 to half its original size (i.e., reduce its value by a factor of 2). This means that the value of Object 2 will change from 6 to 3, and its starting index will remain unchanged at 4.\n\nStep 4: Align Object 3 with Object 2. This means that the value of Object 3 will change from 0 to 3, and its starting index will become 7 instead of 0.\n\nStep 5: Remove Object 1 from the input sequence. This means that the value of Object 1 will change from 6 to 0, and its starting index will become -1 instead of 1.\n\nStep 6: Add a new object with a value of 0 and a starting index of 8. This new object will be placed after Object 3 in the input sequence.\n\nStep 7: Scale Object 2 to twice its original size (i.e., increase its value by a factor of 2). This means that the value of Object 2 will change from 3 to 6, and its starting index will remain unchanged at 4.\n\nStep 8: Move Object 3 to the last position in the input sequence. This means that the value of Object 3 will change from 6 to 0, and its starting index will become 9 instead of 7.\n\nAnd here's the final output sequence:\n\n[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the order of the objects in the output sequence is the same as in the input sequence, but their values and positions have been modified according to the transformation rules outlined above."
