The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a simple pattern:\n\n* For each object in the input sequence, move it to the next position in the output sequence.\n* If an object overlaps with another object in the output sequence, remove one of them (the smaller one).\n* If an object has no neighboring objects in the output sequence, remove it.\n\nHere are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and make it the new input sequence for the transformation.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their positions and sizes.\n3. Move each object to the next position in the output sequence.\n4. Check for overlapping objects in the output sequence and remove one of them if necessary.\n5. Remove any remaining objects that do not have any neighbors in the output sequence.\n6. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to move objects from their initial positions in the input sequence to their next positions in the output sequence, while removing overlapping objects and objects without neighbors.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nTo perform the transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Input**: Copy the test input sequence and make it the new input sequence for the transformation.\n2. **Object Description**: Regarding the test input, there are three objects:\n\t* Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\n\t* Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n\t* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n3. **Transformed Objects**: In the output sequence, Object 1 moves to position 2, Object 2 moves to position 5, and Object 3 remains at position 6.\n4. **Output**: Create the resulting test output sequence.\n\n**Test Output**: The test output sequence is [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]."
