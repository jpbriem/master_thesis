The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. All elements in the output sequence have the same value as their corresponding counterpart in the input sequence. Therefore, there is no transformation happening here.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of 10 elements, and the output sequence also has 10 elements. However, in this case, some of the elements in the output sequence have a different value than their corresponding counterpart in the input sequence. Specifically, the second element in the output sequence has a value of 9 instead of 0, and the last element in the output sequence has a value of 0 instead of 0.\n* Example_3: This is the most interesting case, where the input sequence consists of 8 elements, and the output sequence consists of 8 elements as well. In this case, some of the elements in the output sequence have a different value than their corresponding counterpart in the input sequence. Specifically, the third element in the output sequence has a value of 4 instead of 0, and the fifth element in the output sequence has a value of 0 instead of 9.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is a simple mapping, where each element in the input sequence maps to the same element in the output sequence, but with some elements having different values.\n\nNow, let's consider how we can transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using this relation. Given an input sequence `x`, we can transform it into its output sequence `y` by simply applying the mapping mentioned above. That is, for each element `i` in `x`, we map it to the corresponding element `j` in `y`, according to the rule `j = i`. If `i` has a value of 0, we set `j` to 0 as well. Otherwise, if `i` has a value greater than 0, we set `j` to the same value.\n\nFor example, if our input sequence is `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we can transform it into the output sequence `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]` by applying the mapping rule. Similarly, if our input sequence is `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]`, we can transform it into the output sequence `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]`.\n\nTherefore, my answer to the question is:\n\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'No transformation happened', 'Example_2': 'Some elements in the output sequence have different values than their corresponding counterparts in the input sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Simple mapping between input and output sequences', 'instructions': 'Transform a new input sequence by applying the mapping rule mentioned above', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence', 'object_description': 'No objects found in the input sequence', 'transformed_objects': 'None', 'output': 'Create the resulting output sequence by applying the mapping rule' }, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format'}"
