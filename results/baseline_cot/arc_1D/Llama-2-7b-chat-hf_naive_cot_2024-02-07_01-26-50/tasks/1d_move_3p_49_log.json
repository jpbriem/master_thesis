The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (objects) at indices 1, 3, 5, and 7. The output sequence also consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros, but they are arranged differently than the input sequence. Specifically, the non-zeros in the output sequence are shifted one index to the right compared to the input sequence.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 4 non-zeros (objects) at indices 1, 2, 4, and 6. The output sequence again consists of 8 zeros and 4 non-zeros, but they are arranged differently than the input sequence. Specifically, the non-zeros in the output sequence are shifted two indices to the right compared to the input sequence.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (objects) at indices 1 and 3. The output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros, but they are arranged differently than the input sequence. Specifically, the non-zeros in the output sequence are shifted one index to the left compared to the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves shifting the non-zeros in the input sequence to the corresponding positions in the output sequence. This could be achieved through a simple sliding window approach, where each non-zero is moved to the next position in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to the test input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTransformed output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the transformed output sequence has the same structure as the input sequence, but with the non-zeros shifted to the correct positions according to the transformation pattern observed in the input-output pairs.\n\nTherefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a sliding window approach, where each non-zero is moved to the next position in the output sequence."
