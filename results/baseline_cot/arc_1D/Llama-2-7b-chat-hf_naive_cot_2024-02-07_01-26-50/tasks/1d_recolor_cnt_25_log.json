The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence according to certain rules. Here's what I observe:\n\n* In each input sequence, there are one or more objects (represented by non-zero values) that are adjacent to each other. These objects can be moved, resized, or otherwise transformed.\n* The objects are related to each other through various conditions, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment. For example, two objects may be aligned horizontally or vertically, or they may overlap each other.\n* The noise pixels (represented by zero values) seem to play a role in determining the final output sequence.\n\nTo transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, I would propose the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. These are the non-zero values that are adjacent to each other.\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects based on the logical rules provided. For example, an object may be moved, resized, or rotated.\nStep 3: Take into account the relationships between the objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, and containment. Based on these relationships, apply additional transformations to the objects.\nStep 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no further transformations can be applied.\nStep 5: Output the resulting sequence of transformed objects.\n\nHere's an example of how this process could work for the given input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. There are three objects in this sequence: {Object 1: [0, 0], Object 2: [4, 4], Object 3: [4, 0]}.\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects based on the logical rules provided. For example, Object 1 is moved two positions to the right, Object 2 is resized to twice its original size, and Object 3 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nStep 3: Take into account the relationships between the objects. For example, Object 1 overlaps with Object 2, so their boundaries need to be aligned.\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no further transformations can be applied. The resulting transformed objects are: {Object 1: [2, 0], Object 2: [6, 4], Object 3: [4, 2]}.\n\nStep 5: Output the resulting sequence of transformed objects. The resulting output sequence is [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0].\n\nOf course, this is just one possible way to approach this problem, and there may be many other ways to solve it depending on the specific requirements of the task."
