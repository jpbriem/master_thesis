            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn the given input sequence, there are two objects:\n\nObject 1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject 2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Understand the transformation rules\n\nFrom the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the transformation pattern involves applying the following rules to each object in the input sequence:\n\n* Move the object one position to the right (or left) if the next pixel in the sequence has the same color as the current object.\n* If the next pixel has a different color than the current object, remove the current object and shift all subsequent objects to the right (or left).\n* Scale the current object by a factor of 2 if the next pixel has a color that is twice the current object's color.\n* Remove the current object if the next pixel has a color that is equal to the current object's color.\n\nStep 3: Transform the input sequence\n\nUsing the above transformation rules, we can now apply them to the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: Move one position to the right since the next pixel has the same color as Object 1.\nObject 2: Remove since the next pixel has a different color than Object 2.\n\nNew Object 1: Scale by a factor of 2 since the next pixel has a color that is twice the color of Object 1.\nNew Object 2: Since the next pixel has a different color than Object 2, remove Object 2 and shift all subsequent objects to the right.\n\nOutput sequence:\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the output sequence may have fewer objects than the input sequence due to the removal of objects that no longer meet the transformation criteria.\n\nOverall pattern:\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to manipulate individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. The transformation rules involve moving, scaling, removing, and copying objects based on these factors."
