The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size, position, and color of each object are specified in the output sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves several logical rules:\n\n* Move: Shift an object by a fixed amount (either horizontally or vertically) without changing its size or color.\n* Hollow: Remove an object completely, leaving behind any remaining pixels unchanged.\n* Scale: Resize an object by a factor (positive or negative), while maintaining its position and color.\n* Remove: Delete an object entirely, including any pixels it may have occupied.\n* Copy: Duplicate an object exactly, including its position, size, and color.\n* Recolor: Replace every pixel in an object with a new color (also positive or negative).\n\nThese rules apply recursively to all objects in the input sequence, and the output sequence reflects the final state of the objects after applying these rules.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is that objects are manipulated through various operations (move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor), which can affect their size, position, and color. These operations are applied repeatedly to create the output sequence.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Iterate over each pixel in the input sequence, applying the appropriate operation based on the current object (if any):\na. If the current pixel belongs to an existing object, perform the designated operation (move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor) on that object.\nb. If the current pixel does not belong to any existing object, create a new object of the correct size and color.\nc. Add the newly created object to the output sequence at its proper position.\n3. Repeat step 2 until all pixels in the input sequence have been processed.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere are the specific instructions for each type of operation:\n\n* **Move**: Shift the object by the given amount (horizontally or vertically) without changing its size or color. Update the position of the object in the output sequence accordingly.\n* **Hollow**: Remove the entire object, leaving behind any remaining pixels unchanged. Set the corresponding index in the output sequence to 0.\n* **Scale**: Resize the object by the given factor (positive or negative), while maintaining its position and color. Update the size of the object in the output sequence accordingly.\n* **Remove**: Delete the object entirely, including any pixels it may have occupied. Set the corresponding indices in the output sequence to 0.\n* **Copy**: Duplicate the object exactly, including its position, size, and color. Create a new object at the appropriate position in the output sequence.\n* **Recolor**: Replace every pixel in the object with the new color (also positive or negative). Update the color of the object in the output sequence accordingly.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nUsing the provided input sequence, the resulting output sequence would be:\n```json\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and the positions and sizes of the objects remain consistent throughout the transformation process."
