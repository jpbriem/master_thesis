The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors). The output sequence also consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 2 (representing the background color). It's clear that the transformation rule here is to replace each pixel value with the nearest neighbor in the output sequence, based on the Euclidean distance.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 8 (representing different colors). The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 8 (representing the same colors as the input sequence). Again, it seems that the transformation rule here is to simply copy the input pixels without any modification.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 6 (representing different colors). The output sequence also consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 6 (representing the same colors as the input sequence). This time, there doesn't seem to be any obvious transformation rule, as the input and output sequences have the same distribution of colors.\n\nNow, let me apply these insights to the given test case:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the previous examples, I would expect the output sequence to consist of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 2 (representing the background color). To obtain the output sequence, I would apply the following transformation steps:\n\n1. Replace each pixel value with the nearest neighbor in the output sequence, based on the Euclidean distance.\n2. Repeat step 1 until no more changes occur.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence for the given test case would be:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the transformation rule here is similar to the one observed in Example 1, where each pixel value is replaced with the nearest neighbor in the output sequence based on the Euclidean distance."
