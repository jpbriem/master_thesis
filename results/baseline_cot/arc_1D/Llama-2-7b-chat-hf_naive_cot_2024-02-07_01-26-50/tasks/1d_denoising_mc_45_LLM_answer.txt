[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

Example 1:
Input: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

From this example, we can observe that the input sequence consists of a series of 0s and 1s, where each 1 represents an object. The output sequence also consists of a series of 0s and 1s, but with some differences:

* All the 1s in the input sequence have been replaced by 0s in the output sequence.
* The number of 1s in the input sequence is reduced by 1 in the output sequence (i.e., from 3 to 2).

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation rule is simply to replace every 1 in the input sequence with a 0 in the output sequence, and reduce the total number of 1s by 1.

Example 2:
Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`

In this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of 0s and 7s, where each 7 represents an object. The output sequence also consists of a series of 0s and 7s, but with some differences:

* Every 7 in the input sequence has been replaced by another 7 in the output sequence.
* There are no objects in the output sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation rule is simply to replace every 7 in the input sequence with another 7 in the output sequence, without any changes to the number of objects.

Example 3:
Input: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 3, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

In this example, we can see that the input sequence consists of a series of 0s and 7s, where each 7 represents an object. The output sequence also consists of a series of 0s and 7s, but with some differences:

* Every 7 in the input sequence has been replaced by another 7 in the output sequence.
* There are no objects in the output sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation rule is simply to replace every 7 in the input sequence with another 7 in the output sequence, without any changes to the number of objects.

Now, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:

Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Using the transformation rule learned from the previous examples, we can transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:

Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

As expected, the output sequence consists of a series of 0s and 1s, where each 1 represents an object. The number of objects in the output sequence is the same as the number of objects in the input sequence.

Therefore, based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, the simplest possible relation between input and output appears to be a simple replacement rule: replacing every 1 in the input sequence with a 0 in the output sequence, while reducing the total number of 1s by 1.
