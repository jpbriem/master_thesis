The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2.\nIn the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 0), we need to move Object 1 to position 2.\n\nStep 2: Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\nObject 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4 in the input sequence. By scaling it by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, we can make it twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 3: Remove Object 3.\nObject 3 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8 in the input sequence. Since it is not present in the output sequence, we need to remove it from the input sequence.\n\nStep 4: Recolor Object 4 to have a color of 9 instead of 4.\nObject 4 has a starting index of 9 and an ending index of 9 in the input sequence. By recoloring it to have a color of 9 instead of 4, we can change its appearance in the output sequence.\n\nStep 5: Copy Object 5 and paste it after Object 4.\nObject 5 has a starting index of 10 and an ending index of 10 in the input sequence. By copying it and pasting it after Object 4, we can create a new object that is identical to Object 5 but appears in a different position in the output sequence.\n\nStep 6: Move Object 6 to Position 4.\nObject 6 has a starting index of 11 and an ending index of 11 in the input sequence. Since the starting index of Object 6 is greater than the starting index of Object 4 (which is 0), we need to move Object 6 to position 4 in the output sequence.\n\nStep 7: Scale Object 7 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\nObject 7 has a starting index of 12 and an ending index of 12 in the input sequence. By scaling it by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, we can make it twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 8: Remove Object 8.\nObject 8 has a starting index of 13 and an ending index of 13 in the input sequence. Since it is not present in the output sequence, we need to remove it from the input sequence.\n\nStep 9: Recolor Object 9 to have a color of 0 instead of 9.\nObject 9 has a starting index of 14 and an ending index of 14 in the input sequence. By recoloring it to have a color of 0 instead of 9, we can change its appearance in the output sequence.\n\nAnd that's it! Applying these steps to the input sequence [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]."
