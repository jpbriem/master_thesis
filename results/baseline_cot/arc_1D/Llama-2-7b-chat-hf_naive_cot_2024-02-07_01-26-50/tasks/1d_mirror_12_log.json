The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Additionally, there are noise pixels that need to be handled.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the input sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. There are three objects in the input sequence:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 2}\n* Object 2: {color: 1, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1}\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence. Based on the given examples, we can observe that the following operations are applied:\n\n* Move objects: Object 1 is moved two positions to the right, while Object 2 is moved one position to the left.\n* Scale objects: Object 1 is scaled up by a factor of 2, while Object 2 is scaled down by a factor of 2.\n* Remove objects: Object 3 is removed from the sequence.\n* Recolor objects: The remaining objects are recolored to have a color value of 9.\n\nApplying these operations to the input sequence results in the following transformed sequence:\n\nTransformed sequence: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs requested, here are the detailed steps to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).\n\nStep 2: Apply the necessary operations to each object in the input sequence, based on the transformation pattern. This may involve moving objects, scaling them, removing them, recoloring them, or handling noise pixels.\n\nStep 3: Repeat Step 2 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.\n\nStep 4: Output the resulting transformed sequence.\n\nRegarding the test output sequence, it appears to be a simple repetition of the input sequence with some slight variations in the color values. To transform the test input sequence into its corresponding test output sequence, we can apply the same transformation pattern as before, but with some minor adjustments to account for the differences in the color values. Here's the transformed test output sequence:\n\nTransformed test output sequence: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFinally, here is the JSON response with the required information:\n\n{\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"The input sequence contains three objects: Object 1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 2}; Object 2: {color: 1, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}; Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 1}. After applying the transformation pattern, the objects are moved, scaled, removed, and recolored. Specifically, Object 1 is moved two positions to the right, while Object 2 is moved one position to the left; Object 1 is scaled up by a factor of 2, while Object 2 is scaled down by a factor of 2; Object 3 is removed from the sequence. The resulting transformed sequence is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\",\n\"Example_2\": \"The input sequence contains four objects: Object 1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}; Object 2: {color: 2, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}; Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 1}; Object 4: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 9, size: 1}.
