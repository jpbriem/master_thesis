[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of zeros and ones, with some objects (represented by non-zero values) appearing twice. The output sequence also consists of zeros and ones, but with no objects. It seems that the transformation pattern here is simply copying the input sequence without any modifications.
* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of zeros and ones, with some objects appearing multiple times. However, the output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with all non-zero values replaced by zeros. Again, it seems that the transformation pattern here is simply copying the input sequence without any modifications.
* Example_3: This is the most interesting case so far, as the input sequence consists of a single object (represented by two consecutive non-zero values) surrounded by a sea of zeros. The output sequence also consists of a single object, but with the non-zero value replaced by five copies of itself. It seems that the transformation pattern here is to duplicate the object in the input sequence.

Now, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:

Input sequence: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the given instruction, we need to transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Here's my reasoning:

1. Since there are no objects in the input sequence, there should be no objects in the output sequence either.
2. Since the input sequence consists of consecutive zeros and ones, the output sequence should consist of consecutive zeros and ones as well.
3. Since there are no duplicates of the same value in the input sequence, there should be no duplicates of the same value in the output sequence either.

Using these insights, we can transform the input sequence as follows:

Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As requested, I will provide the description, overall pattern, instructions, and transformation for the given input-output pairs, as well as the test output for the given input sequence.

Description:
The given input-output pairs exhibit a simple transformation pattern where the input sequence is copied verbatim to the output sequence without any modifications. The only exception is when there are objects in the input sequence, in which case they are duplicated in the output sequence.

Overall pattern: Copy the input sequence verbatim to the output sequence without any modifications.

Instructions:
Transform the input sequence by copying it verbatim to the output sequence. If there are any objects in the input sequence, duplicate them in the output sequence.

Transformation:
Copy the input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!

Test output:
Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length! Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!
