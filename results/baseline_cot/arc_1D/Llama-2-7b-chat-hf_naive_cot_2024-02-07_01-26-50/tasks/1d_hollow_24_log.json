The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with all objects removed. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves removing objects from the input sequence.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of multiple objects of the same color adjacent to each other. The output sequence removes some of these objects while maintaining their relative positions. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves moving or removing objects in the input sequence.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of a single object surrounded by noise pixels. The output sequence removes the object and replaces it with a new object of the same color. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves creating or modifying objects in the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, I can propose the following transformation rule:\n\nFor any input sequence [x_1, x_2,..., x_n], where x_i represents a pixel value (0 or 1), the output sequence [y_1, y_2,..., y_n] is obtained by applying the following operations:\n\n1. Remove any object(s) in the input sequence that have a size greater than 1.\n2. If there are no more objects left in the input sequence, return the input sequence unchanged. Otherwise, create a new object at the starting index of the input sequence with a size equal to the number of remaining objects. Set the value of this new object to 1.\n3. Move any remaining objects in the input sequence one position towards the right.\n4. Replace any object in the input sequence with a new object of the same color if the position of the object matches the starting index of another object in the input sequence.\n\nUsing this transformation rule, I can now transform a new input sequence [a_1, a_2,..., a_n] into its corresponding output sequence [b_1, b_2,..., b_n]. Here's an example of how this works:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTransformed output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs requested, here is the JSON representation of the transformation:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. Be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Move any remaining objects in the input sequence one position towards the right.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[a_1, a_2,..., a_n]\",\n        \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color\",\n        \"output\": \"[b_1, b_2,..., b_n]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nPlease note that this is just one possible interpretation of the given problem, and there may be other valid solutions."
