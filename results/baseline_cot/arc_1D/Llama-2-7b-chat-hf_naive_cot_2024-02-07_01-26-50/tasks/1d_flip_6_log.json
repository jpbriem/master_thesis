            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn the given input sequence, there are three distinct objects:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] - This object consists of 8 consecutive pixels with the value 0, followed by one pixel with the value 1.\n* Object 2: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] - This object consists of 6 consecutive pixels with the value 5.\n* Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - This object consists of 9 consecutive pixels with the value 0.\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to each object\n\nBased on the given transformation pattern, we can apply the following transformations to each object:\n\n* Move Object 1 one pixel to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 horizontally: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] -> [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]\n* Remove Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 3: Combine the transformed objects\n\nAfter applying the transformations to each object, we need to combine them to form the output sequence. Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the combined sequence should have the same number of elements as the input sequence, but with some elements modified or removed. Specifically, we can concatenate the transformed objects in the order they appear in the input sequence, like so:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 10, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that some elements in the output sequence have been modified or removed compared to the original input sequence. In particular, Object 1 has been moved one pixel to the right, Object 2 has been scaled horizontally by a factor of 2, and Object 3 has been removed entirely.\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this problem can be summarized as follows:\n\nInput \u2192 Transformations \u2192 Output\n\nWhere the transformations involve moving, scaling, and removing objects based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels in the image."
