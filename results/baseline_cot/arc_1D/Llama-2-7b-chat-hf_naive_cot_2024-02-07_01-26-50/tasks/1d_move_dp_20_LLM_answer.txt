[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In the input sequence [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], there are two objects:

Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 5}
Object 2: {color: 1, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 2}

Step 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object

For Object 1, we need to apply the following rules:

* Move 2 positions to the right (i.e., from index 5 to index 7)
* Scale by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double the size in x and y directions)
* Remove the middle 2 pixels (i.e., from index 3 to index 4)

After applying these rules, Object 1 becomes:

{color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 7, size: 7}

For Object 2, we need to apply the following rule:

* Recolor to color 0 (background color)

After applying this rule, Object 2 becomes:

{color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 2}

Step 3: Transform the remaining pixels

For the remaining pixels in the input sequence, we need to apply the following rule:

* If the current pixel is not an object, leave it unchanged
* Otherwise, recolor it to the same color as the surrounding pixels (i.e., the background color)

After applying this rule, the output sequence is obtained.

Here's the complete transformation process in JSON format:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "Move Object 1 2 positions to the right, scale it by 2 in both directions, remove the middle 2 pixels, and recolor it to color 7.",
    "Example_2": "Move Object 2 1 position to the left, scale it by 2 in both directions, remove the middle 2 pixels, and recolor it to color 0."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Apply transformation rules to objects, then transform remaining pixels",
  "instructions": "Identify objects in input sequence, apply transformation rules to each object, and transform remaining pixels.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
    "object_description": "{color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 7, size: 7}",
    "transformed_objects": "{color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 7, size: 7}"
  },
  "test_output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}
```
Note that the `test_output` field contains the resulting output sequence, which has the same length as the input sequence.
