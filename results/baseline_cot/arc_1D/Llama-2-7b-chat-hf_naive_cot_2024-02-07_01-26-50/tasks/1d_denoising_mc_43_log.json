The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and removing objects. The output sequence is obtained by applying these operations in a specific way.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence by a fixed amount (either left or right).\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor (either multiplying or dividing their size).\n3. Remove some of the objects in the input sequence based on their color and position.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 multiple times, with the number of repetitions determined by the noise pixels in the input sequence.\n5. Output the resulting sequence of objects.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence and make it the variable `input`.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence using their size, position, and color.\n3. Apply the transformation operations to the objects in the input sequence, using the appropriate logic rules based on the type of operation (move, scale, remove, etc.).\n4. Update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence based on the results of the transformation operations.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.\n6. Return the final output sequence as the result of the transformation.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere are the detailed instructions for each transformation operation:\n\n* **Move**: If the object is moved left or right, update its position in the output sequence accordingly. If the object is moved up or down, do nothing.\n* **Scale**: If the object is scaled up or down, update its size in the output sequence accordingly. If the object is not scaled, do nothing.\n* **Remove**: If an object overlaps with another object in the same row or column, remove one of them (based on the order they appear in the sequence). Update the positions and sizes of the remaining objects in the output sequence accordingly.\n* **Noise Pixels**: Add random noise pixels to the input sequence if there are any noise pixels in the input sequence.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nUsing the given input sequence, here is the resulting output sequence:\n```json\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and the objects in the output sequence have the same properties (size, position, color) as the objects in the input sequence."
