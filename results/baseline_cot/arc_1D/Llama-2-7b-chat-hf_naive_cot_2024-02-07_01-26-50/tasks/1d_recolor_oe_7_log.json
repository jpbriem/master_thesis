The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are grouped together based on their color. The objects are also aligned horizontally. In the output sequence, each object is represented by a single pixel of the corresponding color. The size of each object remains the same, but the position of the objects has been shifted by one pixel compared to the input sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the objects in the input sequence are again grouped together based on their color. However, the objects in the output sequence are not aligned horizontally anymore. Instead, they are scattered randomly throughout the sequence. Each object is represented by a single pixel of the corresponding color.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is that the input sequence is transformed into an output sequence where each object is represented by a single pixel of the corresponding color. The position and size of each object remain the same, but the objects are shifted and scattered randomly throughout the sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nTransformed Output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the transformed output sequence looks similar to the output sequences provided earlier. Each object in the input sequence is represented by a single pixel of the corresponding color, and the positions and sizes of the objects remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for this problem is:\n\nTransformation Rule: Given an input sequence [I], transform it into an output sequence [O] according to the following steps:\n\n1. Group the objects in the input sequence based on their color.\n2. Shift each group of objects by one pixel horizontally.\n3. Represent each object by a single pixel of the corresponding color.\n4. Randomly scatter the objects throughout the output sequence.\n\nBy applying this transformation rule to any input sequence, we can generate a corresponding output sequence that exhibits the same pattern of grouping and shifting objects based on their color, while also introducing randomness in the placement of the objects throughout the sequence."
