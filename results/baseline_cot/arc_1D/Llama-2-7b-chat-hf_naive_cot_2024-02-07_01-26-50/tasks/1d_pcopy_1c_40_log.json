The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with each object being larger than the previous one.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of a single object (represented by three consecutive non-zero values) followed by noise pixels. The output sequence consists of multiple objects, where each object is smaller than the previous one.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of a single object (represented by two consecutive non-zero values) followed by noise pixels. The output sequence consists of a single object, which is unchanged from the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves scaling down the objects while maintaining their positions, and adding noise pixels in between the objects.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep-by-step transformation:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: There are two objects in the input sequence, represented by non-zero values at indices 1 and 3.\n2. Scale down the objects: Since the objects are scaled down in the output sequence, we need to divide their sizes by a factor of 2. So, the object at index 1 has a size of 2 now, and the object at index 3 has a size of 4 now.\n3. Add noise pixels: We need to add noise pixels in between the objects to simulate the noise present in the output sequence. So, we add a random value between 0 and 1 to every other position in the sequence (positions 2, 4, 6, etc.).\n4. Output the transformed sequence: The final output sequence would be [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence is:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo, the transformation rule for this problem is:\n\nTransformation rule: Take an input sequence consisting of objects separated by noise pixels, and transform it into an output sequence where each object is scaled down and surrounded by noise pixels.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
