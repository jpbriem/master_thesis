The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a simple pattern:\n\n* All objects are moved one position to the right in the output sequence.\n* If an object overlaps with another object at the next position, they are merged into a single larger object.\n* If an object has no neighbor at the next position, it is removed from the output sequence.\n\nHere are the instructions for transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence, starting from the first element.\n3. For each element in the input sequence, apply the transformation rules as follows:\na. If the current element is part of an object, move it one position to the right in the output sequence.\nb. If the current element overlaps with another element at the next position, merge them into a single larger object.\nc. If the current element has no neighbor at the next position, remove it from the output sequence.\n4. Repeat step 3 until the end of the input sequence is reached.\n5. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nHere is the test output sequence for the given input sequence:\n```json\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAs you can see, the objects in the input sequence have been moved one position to the right in the output sequence, and any objects that overlapped with each other were merged into a single larger object. Additionally, any objects that had no neighbor at the next position were removed from the output sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
