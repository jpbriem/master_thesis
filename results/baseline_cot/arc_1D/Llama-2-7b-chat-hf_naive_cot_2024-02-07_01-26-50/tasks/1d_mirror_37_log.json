            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn each input sequence, there are several distinct objects (represented by consecutive pixels of the same color). In the given examples, the objects are:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] - consists of 5 pixels, where the first and last pixels are black, and the middle 3 pixels are red.\n* Object 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2] - consists of 5 pixels, where the first and last pixels are black, and the middle 3 pixels are blue.\n* Object 3: [0, 2, 2, 0, 9] - consists of 5 pixels, where the first and last pixels are black, and the middle 3 pixels are green.\n\nStep 2: Define the transformation rules\n\nBased on the given examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying one or more of the following operations to each object in the input sequence:\n\n* Move: shift an object left or right by a fixed number of pixels.\n* Hollow: remove a single pixel from an object.\n* Scale: resize an object by a factor (e.g., increasing or decreasing its width or height).\n* Remove: delete an entire object from the sequence.\n* Copy: duplicate an object and add it to the sequence at a random position.\n* Recolor: change the color of an object to a new value (e.g., from red to blue).\n\nStep 3: Transform the input sequence\n\nUsing the defined transformation rules, apply them to each object in the input sequence, one by one, until the entire sequence has been transformed. Here's how I would perform the transformation for the given input sequence:\n\nObject 1: Move the first pixel left by 2 positions, then hollow the second pixel, and scale the third pixel down by a factor of 0.5.\nObject 2: Move the first pixel right by 2 positions, then recolor the second pixel to blue, and remove the third pixel.\nObject 3: Scale the first pixel up by a factor of 1.5, then move the second pixel left by 1 position, and recolor the third pixel to green.\n\nAfter applying these transformations to each object in the input sequence, the resulting output sequence will consist of the transformed objects, along with any noise pixels that may have been introduced during the transformation process.\n\nHere's the transformed output sequence for the given input sequence:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the resulting output sequence may not have the same length as the original input sequence, depending on the specific transformation rules applied to each object."
