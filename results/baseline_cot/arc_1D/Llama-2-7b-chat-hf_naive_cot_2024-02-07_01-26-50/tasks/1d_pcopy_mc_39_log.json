The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the relations between them include moving, scaling, and overlapping. The noise pixels are represented by random integers between 0 and 9.\n\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.\n2. Scale the objects by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., horizontally and vertically).\n3. Move the objects towards the center of the sequence by a distance equal to half their original size.\n4. Overlap the objects by shifting them slightly towards each other, so that they partially cover each other.\n5. Remove any remaining noise pixels.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation of each step:\n\n1. **Identify objects and their positions**: In the input sequence, we identify objects by adjacent pixels of the same color. We also track the position of each object, including its starting index, ending index, and size.\n2. **Scale objects**: To scale the objects, we multiply each pixel value by a factor of 2 in both directions. This means that the width and height of each object are doubled, while the distance between objects remains unchanged.\n3. **Move objects towards center**: After scaling the objects, we move them towards the center of the sequence by a distance equal to half their original size. This helps to reduce the amount of space taken up by each object and create a more compact layout.\n4. **Overlap objects**: To overlap the objects, we shift them slightly towards each other, so that they partially cover each other. This creates a sense of depth and density in the sequence.\n5. **Remove noise pixels**: Finally, we remove any remaining noise pixels by setting them to 0.\n\n**Transformed objects**: After applying these steps, the transformed objects will have a smaller size than before, but they will still maintain their original shape and color. They will also be aligned towards the center of the sequence, creating a more organized and cohesive layout.\n\n**Output sequence**: The final output sequence will consist of the transformed objects, along with any remaining noise pixels set to 0. The sequence will have the same length as the input sequence.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
