The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 8 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3. The output sequence also consists of 8 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are two objects in the output sequence (Object_1 and Object_2). Object_1 is located at positions [1, 2, 3], and Object_2 is located at positions [5, 6, 7]. The size of Object_1 is 2x2, and the size of Object_2 is 1x1.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 2. The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 2. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are three objects in the output sequence (Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3). Object_1 is located at positions [1, 3, 5], Object_2 is located at positions [2, 4, 6], and Object_3 is located at positions [8, 9, 10]. The size of Object_1 is 2x2, the size of Object_2 is 1x1, and the size of Object_3 is 1x1.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are three objects in the output sequence (Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3). Object_1 is located at positions [1, 3, 5], Object_2 is located at positions [2, 4, 6], and Object_3 is located at positions [7, 8, 9]. The size of Object_1 is 3x3, the size of Object_2 is 2x2, and the size of Object_3 is 1x1.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving objects around, scaling them, and possibly removing some of them. Additionally, there may be noise pixels present in the input sequence that do not affect the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's consider a new input sequence and apply the transformation actions to it:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Move Object_1 to position [1, 2, 3].\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 2: Scale Object_2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 3: Remove Object_3.\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation action for the given input sequence would be:\n\nMove Object_1 to position [1, 2, 3]; scale Object_2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions; remove Object_3.\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible interpretation of the given transformation pattern, and there may be other valid ways to apply the transformation actions to the input sequence."
