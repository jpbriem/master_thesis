[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1D input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a specific value (0-8) representing a particular object or feature. The transformation rule appears to involve various operations such as moving, scaling, and aligning objects, as well as counting and sorting objects.

To solve this problem, I will provide a detailed description of the input-output pairs provided in the examples, followed by a step-by-step explanation of how to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Input-Output Pairs:

* Example 1: Input = [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], Output = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Example 2: Input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], Output = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
* Example 3: Input = [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], Output = [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Step-by-Step Transformation:

1. Initialize the output sequence with zeros.
2. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the specified criteria (e.g., color, size, position).
3. Apply the necessary transformation rules to each object in the input sequence, based on their type (e.g., move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor).
4. Update the output sequence by adding the transformed objects, ensuring that they are properly aligned and positioned.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.
6. Return the final output sequence.

For example, consider the given input sequence:

Input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

We can apply the transformation rules as follows:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence:
	* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}
	* Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 1}
2. Apply the transformation rules to each object:
	* Object 1: Move 2 positions to the right.
	* Object 2: Remove.
3. Update the output sequence:
	* Add Object 1 to the output sequence at position 3.
	* Add Object 2 to the output sequence at position 7.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.

The final output sequence would be:

Output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Note that the transformation pattern may vary depending on the specific instructions provided in the task.
