You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem. Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the given examples:

Example 1:
The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 7 ones, while the output sequence consists of 10 zeros and 0 ones. It's clear that the transformation pattern involves flipping the bits (i.e., changing a 0 to a 1 or vice versa) between adjacent elements. Specifically, every odd-indexed element in the input sequence becomes an even-indexed element in the output sequence, and vice versa.

Example 2:
The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 7 ones, while the output sequence consists of 10 zeros and 0 ones. Similar to Example 1, the transformation pattern involves flipping the bits between adjacent elements. However, there's a twist here - every other element in the input sequence becomes the opposite color (i.e., a 0 becomes a 7 and vice versa).

Example 3:
The input sequence consists of 8 ones and 0 zeros, while the output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 0 ones. In this case, the transformation pattern involves simply copying the bits from the input sequence to the output sequence without any flipping or color changes.

Now, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the given examples and the inference made above, we can expect the following transformation pattern:

* Every odd-indexed element in the input sequence becomes an even-indexed element in the output sequence.
* Every element in the input sequence becomes the opposite color (i.e., a 0 becomes a 7 and vice versa).

Applying these rules to the given input sequence yields the following output sequence:

Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As expected, the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence and consists of alternating zeros and fives. Note that the color of each element remains unchanged throughout the transformation process.

Therefore, the transformation rule for this problem can be summarized as follows:

Transformation Rule:

1. If the index of the current element is odd, change its color to the opposite color.
2. Otherwise, do nothing (i.e., keep the element's original color).

By applying this rule repeatedly to the input sequence, we can generate the corresponding output sequence.
