            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [5, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn the given input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], we can identify three objects:\n\nObject 1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject 2: {color: 4, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}\nObject 3: {color: 5, start_index: 5, end_index: 5, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to each object\n\nBased on the given transformation patterns, we can apply the following transformations to each object:\n\nObject 1: Move one pixel to the right (i.e., shift the entire object to the right).\nObject 2: Scale up by a factor of 2 (i.e., double the size of the object).\nObject 3: Remove the middle pixel (i.e., shrink the object down to half its original size).\n\nStep 3: Update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence\n\nAfter applying the transformations to each object, we need to update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence. Here's how we can do it:\n\nObject 1: Position remains unchanged at [0, 0]. Size increases from 2 to 3 pixels wide.\nObject 2: Position moves one pixel to the left (i.e., shifts the entire object to the left). Size increases from 1 to 2 pixels wide.\nObject 3: Position moves two pixels to the right (i.e., shifts the entire object to the right). Size decreases from 1 to 0 pixels wide.\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 1-3 for all input sequences\n\nBy repeating steps 1-3 for all input sequences, we can generate the corresponding output sequences. Here are the output sequences for the given input-output pairs:\n\nOutput for Example_1: [0, 0, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput for Example_2: [0, 0, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput for Example_3: [6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOverall pattern:\nThe overall pattern of the transformation appears to involve moving, scaling, removing, and copying pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. By applying these transformations repeatedly to each input sequence, we can generate the corresponding output sequences."
