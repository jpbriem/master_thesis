The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the transformation involves simply copying the input sequence without any modification. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between input and output is a one-to-one correspondence between each element in the input sequence and the corresponding element in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's consider the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nBased on the given transformation actions, we need to perform the following steps to transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Copy the input sequence without any modification.\n\nStep 2: Move the first object (size = 8) two positions to the right.\n\nStep 3: Remove the second object (size = 8).\n\nStep 4: Scale the third object (size = 8) by a factor of 2 in both directions.\n\nStep 5: Align the fourth object (size = 8) with the third object (size = 8) at the center.\n\nStep 6: Overlap the fifth object (size = 8) with the sixth object (size = 8) by moving the sixth object (size = 8) three positions to the left.\n\nStep 7: Remove the seventh object (size = 8).\n\nStep 8: Repeat steps 2-7 until there are no more objects remaining in the input sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\nOutput: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nNote that the transformed output sequence has the same length as the original input sequence.\n\nFinally, please provide the actual input sequence you want me to transform, and I will apply the above transformation steps to obtain the corresponding output sequence."
