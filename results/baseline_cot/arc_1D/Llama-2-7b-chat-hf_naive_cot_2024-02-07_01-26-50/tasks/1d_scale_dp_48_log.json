The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of 10 zeros followed by a single non-zero element (4) at index 4. The output sequence also consists of 10 zeros followed by a single non-zero element (4) at index 4. Therefore, it seems that the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input elements without any modification.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of 10 zeros followed by a single non-zero element (5) at index 5. The output sequence also consists of 10 zeros followed by a single non-zero element (5) at index 5. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input elements without any modification.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of 7 ones followed by 3 zeros. The output sequence consists of 7 ones followed by 3 zeros. This suggests that the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input elements without any modification.\n\nBased on these observations, it appears that the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input elements without any modification. Therefore, the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences is a one-to-one mapping, where each input element is mapped to the corresponding output element without any change.\n\nNow, let's consider how to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using this transformation pattern. Suppose we have a new input sequence `x` of length `n`. We can transform `x` into its corresponding output sequence `y` by simply copying the elements of `x` without any modification, i.e., `y = x`.\n\nTherefore, the transformation function `T` that maps an input sequence `x` to its corresponding output sequence `y` is defined as follows:\n```scss\nT(x) = x\n```\nFinally, here is the JSON object that describes the transformation:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"No transformation applied.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"No transformation applied.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"No transformation applied.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Copy the input sequence without any modification\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Transform a new input sequence by simply copying its elements without any modification.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\",\n        \"object_description\": \"No description provided.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"No description provided.\",\n        \"output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence.\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\"\n}\n```\nNote that since the transformation pattern involves simply copying the input elements without any modification, the resulting output sequence will also have the same length as the input sequence."
