The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some modifications. Specifically, some of the object sizes have been increased or decreased, and some of the object positions have been shifted slightly. It seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the size and position of the objects in the output sequence relative to their counterparts in the input sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of a single large object surrounded by smaller objects, with some noise pixels in between. The output sequence consists of multiple small objects scattered throughout the sequence, with no larger object present. It appears that the transformation pattern involves breaking up the large object in the input sequence into smaller pieces and scattering them randomly throughout the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of several small objects arranged in a grid-like pattern, with some noise pixels in between. The output sequence consists of a similar grid-like pattern, but with some of the objects resized or repositioned. It seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the size and position of the objects in the output sequence relative to their counterparts in the input sequence.\n\nNow, let me apply these insights to the given test case:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nBased on the given examples and my analysis above, it seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the size and position of the objects in the output sequence relative to their counterparts in the input sequence. In particular, it appears that the objects in the input sequence are being resized and repositioned in a way that creates a more randomized layout in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, my proposed transformation steps for the given test case are as follows:\n\nStep 1: Resize each object in the input sequence by a factor of 1.5 in both the x and y directions. This will create larger versions of the objects in the input sequence.\n\nStep 2: Randomly shift each object in the input sequence by a distance of at least 2 pixels in either the x or y direction. This will cause the objects to become disorganized and scattered throughout the output sequence.\n\nStep 3: Set the color of each object in the output sequence to a random value between 0 and 8 inclusive. This will give the appearance of the objects having different colors.\n\nStep 4: Repeat Steps 1-3 for each iteration of the input sequence.\n\nBy applying these transformation steps, I expect the output sequence to consist of a more randomized layout of objects with varying colors, compared to the original input sequence."
