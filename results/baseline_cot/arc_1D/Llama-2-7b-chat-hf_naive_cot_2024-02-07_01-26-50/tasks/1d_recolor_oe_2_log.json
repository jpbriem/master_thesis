The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their starting and ending indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves several operations, including moving, scaling, and recoloring the objects, as well as adding noise pixels. The exact rules for these operations are as follows:\n\n* Move an object by a random amount (positive or negative) along the sequence.\n* Scale an object by a random factor (positive or negative) without changing its position.\n* Recolor an object by randomly changing its color to one of the other colors in the sequence.\n* Add a noise pixel at a random position in the sequence.\n\nBased on these rules, I will now describe the steps required to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.\n\nStep 2: Loop through each pixel in the input sequence, applying the transformation rules to each object in the sequence.\n\nStep 3: Update the position and size of each object after applying the transformation rules.\n\nStep 4: Check if any objects overlapped or contained another object during the transformation process. If so, adjust the positions and sizes of the affected objects accordingly.\n\nStep 5: Repeat Steps 2-4 until the entire input sequence has been processed.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to apply a series of randomized operations to the input sequence, resulting in a reshuffled and recolored version of the original sequence. The specific operations used in each iteration depend on the current state of the output sequence, which is updated after each operation.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task.\n2. Apply the transformation rules to each object in the sequence, using the appropriate random factors and operations.\n3. Update the position and size of each object after applying the transformation rules.\n4. Check for overlaps and containments between objects, and adjust their positions and sizes as necessary.\n5. Repeat Steps 2-4 until the entire input sequence has been processed.\n6. Output the resulting test output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere are the detailed instructions for each step of the transformation process:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the output sequence with the same length as the input sequence. Use numpy to create an empty array of the same shape as the input sequence.\n\nStep 2: Loop through each pixel in the input sequence, applying the transformation rules to each object in the sequence. For each object, use the following functions:\n\n* `move(x)`: Randomly moves the object by a positive or negative amount `x`.\n* `scale(x)`: Randomly scales the object by a factor `x`, without changing its position.\n* `recolor(color)`: Randomly changes the color of the object to one of the other colors in the sequence.\n* `noise()`: Adds a noise pixel at a random position in the sequence.\n\nStep 3: Update the position and size of each object after applying the transformation rules. For each object, calculate its new position and size based on the movement, scaling, and recoloring operations applied in Step 2.\n\nStep 4: Check if any objects overlapped or contained another object during the transformation process. If so, adjust the positions and sizes of the affected objects accordingly. Use the following functions to check for overlaps and containments:\n\n* `contains(obj)`: Returns True if the specified object contains the current object, otherwise False.\n* `overlaps(obj)`: Returns True if the specified object overlaps with the current object, otherwise False.\n\nStep 5: Repeat Steps 2-4 until the entire input sequence has been processed.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nPlease provide the test output sequence in numpy array format."
