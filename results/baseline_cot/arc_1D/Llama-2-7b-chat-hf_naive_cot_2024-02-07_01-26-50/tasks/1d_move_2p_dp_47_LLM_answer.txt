You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Additionally, there are noise pixels that need to be handled.

To begin with, let's analyze the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0].

From the given output sequence, we can see that the objects in the input sequence have been moved to the right by one position. Specifically, object_1 has moved from index 0 to index 1, object_2 has moved from index 2 to index 3, and so on.

Next, let's examine the objects themselves. From the output sequence, we can see that object_1 has been scaled up by a factor of 2, while object_2 has been scaled down by a factor of 2. Additionally, object_3 has been removed from the sequence entirely.

Now, let's consider how we could transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using these patterns. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through each element in the input sequence, starting from the leftmost element.
a. If the current element is equal to 0, skip it (i.e., don't apply any operation).
b. Otherwise, apply the appropriate operation based on the current element's value:
	* If the current element is greater than or equal to 5, move the next object to the right by one position.
	* If the current element is less than 5, remove the next object from the sequence.
c. Repeat steps b(i) and b(ii) until the end of the input sequence is reached.
3. Once all elements in the input sequence have been processed, repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining elements in the output sequence, starting from the rightmost element.

Here's some sample Python code to illustrate this approach:
```python
def transform_sequence(input_seq):
    # Initialize output sequence of same length as input sequence
    output_seq = np.zeros((len(input_seq),))
    
    # Iterate through input sequence, applying operations accordingly
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        if input_seq[i] == 0:
            pass  # Skip 0-valued elements
        else:
            # Move next object to right by one position if value > 5
            if input_seq[i] >= 5:
                output_seq[i+1] += 1
            
            # Remove next object if value < 5
            elif input_seq[i] < 5:
                output_seq.pop(i+1)
        
    # Repeat for remaining elements in output sequence
    for _ in range(len(output_seq)-1, -1, -1):
        output_seq[_] += 1
    
    return output_seq
```
Finally, here's the JSON response for the given input sequence:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "The input sequence contains 8 objects, each with a size of 1. The objects are aligned horizontally and vertically.",
        "Example_2": "The input sequence contains 6 objects, each with a size of 2. The objects are aligned horizontally and vertically."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Move objects to the right by one position, scale objects by factors of 2, and remove objects with values less than 5.",
    "instructions": "Transform the input sequence by applying the above operations in the order specified.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
        "object_description": "Object_1: {size: 1, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, align: 'horiz'}; Object_2: {size: 1, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, align:'vert'};...; Object_8: {size: 1, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, align: 'horiz'}",
        "transformed_objects": "Object_1: {size: 2, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, align: 'horiz'}; Object_2: {size: 2, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, align:'vert'};...; Object_8: {size: 2, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, align: 'horiz'}"
    },
    "test_output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
