The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating values of 6 and 4, while the output sequence also consists of alternating values of 6 and 4. There is no clear pattern in the input sequence that corresponds to the output sequence.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of a series of 0s and 4s, while the output sequence also consists of a series of 0s and 4s. However, there is a slight shift in the positions of the 0s and 4s in the output sequence compared to the input sequence.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of a mix of values ranging from 0 to 9, while the output sequence consists solely of values ranging from 0 to 4.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern between input and output involves some form of shifting or rearrangement of the values in the sequence. Specifically, it appears that each object in the input sequence is shifted by a fixed amount (either horizontally or vertically) relative to its neighboring objects in the output sequence. Additionally, the size of each object in the output sequence may be smaller than its corresponding object in the input sequence.\n\nNow, let me apply these insights to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. Here's my approach:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: Using the given input sequence, I identify three objects: Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3. Each object has a specific color (2, 2, and 9, respectively), and their starting indices are 1, 4, and 9, respectively.\n2. Determine the transformation rules: Based on the observation made earlier, I determine that each object in the input sequence is shifted by a fixed amount (either horizontally or vertically) relative to its neighboring objects in the output sequence. Specifically, Object_1 is shifted by -1 position relative to Object_2, Object_2 is shifted by -2 positions relative to Object_3, and Object_3 is not shifted at all.\n3. Apply the transformation rules: Using the determined transformation rules, I apply the necessary shifts to each object in the input sequence to position them correctly in the output sequence. For instance, Object_1 is shifted by -1 position relative to Object_2, so its starting index becomes 3 instead of 1. Similarly, Object_2 is shifted by -2 positions relative to Object_3, so its ending index becomes 7 instead of 4.\n4. Update the sizes of the objects: Since the size of each object in the output sequence may be smaller than its corresponding object in the input sequence, I update the sizes of the objects accordingly. For example, since Object_1 has a size of 2 in the input sequence but only needs to occupy a space of 1 in the output sequence, I reduce its size to 1.\n\nWith these steps, I am able to transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the output sequence has fewer objects than the input sequence due to the reduction in size mentioned above. Also, the positions of the objects in the output sequence may differ slightly from their corresponding positions in the input sequence due to the shifting rule applied earlier."
