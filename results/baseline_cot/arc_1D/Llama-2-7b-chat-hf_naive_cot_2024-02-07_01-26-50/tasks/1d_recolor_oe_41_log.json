The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves applying a series of logical rules to the input sequence, which are as follows:\n\n1. Move any object that has a neighbor (i.e., a pixel that shares an edge) with another object of the same color one position in either direction (up, down, left, or right).\n2. Hollow any object that has no neighbors of the same color.\n3. Scale any object by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., double its size).\n4. Remove any object that overlaps with another object of the same color.\n5. Copy any object and paste it at the next position in the sequence.\n6. Recolor any object to match the color of the object it overlaps with.\n\nThese rules are applied iteratively until there are no more changes that can be made to the sequence. The resulting output sequence is then obtained by simply copying the transformed input sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to manipulate the objects in the input sequence by moving them, resizing them, and removing them as necessary. The goal is to create a new sequence where the objects are arranged in a different way, but still follow the same logic as the original sequence.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the output sequence to be empty.\n2. Apply the logical rules listed above to the input sequence, starting with the first object.\n3. For each iteration of the rules, update the output sequence by adding or modifying objects as necessary.\n4. Repeat step 2 until there are no more changes that can be made to the sequence.\n5. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how the transformation should be performed for the given input sequence:\n\n1. Input: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n2. Object description: There are 4 objects in the input sequence, each consisting of 4 pixels. The sizes of the objects are 4x4, 4x4, 4x4, and 4x4.\n3. Transformed objects: After applying the logical rules, the transformed objects will have the following sizes:\n\t* Object 1: 8x8\n\t* Object 2: 4x4\n\t* Object 3: 4x4\n\t* Object 4: 8x8\n4. Output: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nNote that the output sequence is also a 1D array of integers, but it has been modified to reflect the transformation applied to the input sequence."
