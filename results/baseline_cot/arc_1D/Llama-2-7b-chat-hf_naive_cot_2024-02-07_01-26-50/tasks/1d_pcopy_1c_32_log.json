The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the given transformation actions.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 8 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 8 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are 3 objects in the output sequence. The objects in the output sequence are larger than the corresponding pixels in the input sequence.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are 4 objects in the output sequence. The objects in the output sequence are smaller than the corresponding pixels in the input sequence.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. The output sequence also consists of 8 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. There are no objects in the input sequence, but there are 5 objects in the output sequence. The objects in the output sequence are the same size as the corresponding pixels in the input sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves scaling the input sequence by some constant factor, followed by shifting the resulting sequence by some fixed amount. This could be due to the presence of objects in the output sequence, which may require some adjustments to ensure that they align properly.\n\nNow, let's consider a new input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Using the above observation, we can apply the following transformation actions:\n\n1. Scale the input sequence by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., horizontally and vertically). This gives us a new sequence with twice the size of the original input sequence.\n2. Shift the resulting sequence by an amount equal to half the size of the largest object in the output sequence (i.e., 7). This ensures that the objects in the output sequence align properly with the corresponding pixels in the input sequence.\n\nApplying these transformation actions results in the following output sequence:\n[0, 0, 14, 14, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern involving the given input-output pairs can be represented as follows:\n\nInput \u2192 Scale \u00d7 2 \u2192 Shift by -7 \u2192 Output\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
