The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output.

Based on the given examples and instructions, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input sequence consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3, representing different colors. The output sequence also consists of 11 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3, but with some differences in their positions and colors compared to the input sequence. Specifically, there are three objects in the input sequence: two objects with color 3 and one object with color 0. In the output sequence, these objects are still present, but their positions and sizes have changed. For instance, the object with color 3 at index 4 in the input sequence becomes an object with color 2 at index 5 in the output sequence. Similarly, the other object with color 3 at index 8 in the input sequence becomes an object with color 3 at index 9 in the output sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3, representing different colors. The output sequence also consists of 10 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3, but with some differences in their positions and colors compared to the input sequence. Specifically, there are four objects in the input sequence: two objects with color 3 and two objects with color 0. In the output sequence, these objects are still present, but their positions and sizes have changed. For instance, the object with color 3 at index 3 in the input sequence becomes an object with color 2 at index 6 in the output sequence. Similarly, the other object with color 3 at index 7 in the input sequence becomes an object with color 3 at index 8 in the output sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input sequence consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3, representing different colors. The output sequence also consists of 9 pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 3, but with some differences in their positions and colors compared to the input sequence. Specifically, there are three objects in the input sequence: two objects with color 3 and one object with color 0. In the output sequence, these objects are still present, but their positions and sizes have changed. For instance, the object with color 3 at index 5 in the input sequence becomes an object with color 2 at index 7 in the output sequence.\n\nBased on these examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving, scaling, and recoloring objects in the input sequence to create similar objects in the output sequence. Additionally, there may be some noise pixels in the input sequence that do not affect the overall transformation pattern.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom the given examples, we can see that the objects in the input sequence are relatively small compared to the total number of pixels. Therefore, we can assume that the objects in the input sequence are individual pixels, and they do not overlap with each other. Also, since there are no noise pixels in the input sequence, we can ignore them when applying the transformation pattern.\n\nBased on the above assumptions, we can propose the following steps to transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their positions, sizes, and colors.\n\nStep 2: Scale each object in the input sequence by a factor of 1.5 in both x and y directions. This means that each object will be stretched horizontally and vertically by a factor of 1.5.\n\nStep 3: Move each scaled object in the input sequence by a random amount in the x and y directions. Specifically, for each object, randomly generate a vector in the range [-0.5, 0.5] in both x and y directions, and add it to the current position of the object. This will introduce some randomness in the positions of the objects in the output sequence compared to the input sequence.\n\nStep 4: Recolor each object in the input sequence according to the following rule: if the color of an object is greater than 2, change its color to 2. Otherwise, keep the original color of the object. This will introduce some consistency in the colors of the objects in the output sequence compared to the input sequence.\n\nStep 5: Repeat Steps 1-4 for each object in the input sequence until all objects have been processed.\n\nFinally, the output sequence will consist of the transformed objects from the input sequence, along with any additional noise pixels that may have been introduced during the transformation process.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence for the given input sequence would be:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that this is just one possible way to transform the input sequence into its output sequence, and there may be other valid ways to do so depending on the specific requirements of the problem."
