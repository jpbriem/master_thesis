The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn each input sequence, there are several distinct objects (i.e., clusters of contiguous pixels with the same color) that can be identified. For example, in the input sequence `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the objects are:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 0, start index: 0, end index: 2, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 7, start index: 4, end index: 6, size: 3}\n* Object 3: {color: 9, start index: 8, end index: 9, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nBased on the given transformation pattern, it appears that the objects in the input sequence will undergo various transformations, including moving, scaling, and recoloring. For instance, in the output sequence for the input `Example_1`, object 1 moves two positions to the right, while object 2 scales up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nStep 3: Update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence\n\nAfter applying the transformations, the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence will differ from those in the input sequence. For example, in the output sequence for `Example_1`, object 1 has a new position of (6, 6), and object 2 has a new size of (4, 4).\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 1-3 for all input sequences\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, simply repeat steps 1-3 for each input sequence. For instance, if we apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we get the output sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nOverall pattern:\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation seems to involve manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. The specific transformations applied to each object depend on the particular input sequence being transformed.\n\nTransformation instructions:\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Apply the appropriate transformations to each object, based on the given transformation pattern.\n3. Update the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all input sequences.\n\nTest output:\n\nFor the given input sequence `test_input`, the output sequence would be:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence. The input sequence contains 9 pixels of color 0, followed by 9 pixels of color 9. In the output sequence, the first 9 pixels are replaced by pixels of color 9, while the remaining 9 pixels remain unchanged.\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"Manipulate individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels.\",\n  \"instructions\": \"Transform each input sequence by identifying the objects, applying the appropriate transformations, and updating the positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence.\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence.
