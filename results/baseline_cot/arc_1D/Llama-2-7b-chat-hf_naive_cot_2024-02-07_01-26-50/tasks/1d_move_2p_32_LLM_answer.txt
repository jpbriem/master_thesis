[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 2) arranged in a row. The output sequence also consists of 10 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 2) arranged in a row, but with the non-zeros shifted one position to the right compared to the input.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 10 ones (color 8) arranged in a row. The output sequence consists of 10 ones (color 8) arranged in a row, but with the last two elements swapped compared to the input.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 5 ones (color 2) arranged in a row. The output sequence consists of 5 ones (color 2) arranged in a row, but with the last element shifted one position to the left compared to the input.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves shifting or moving objects within the sequence, possibly changing their color or size. Additionally, there may be some conditionality involved, as the output sequence appears to depend on the order of the input elements.

Now, let's consider a new input sequence [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. Using the inference made above, we can propose the following transformation steps:

1. Shift the first object (color 3) one position to the right, so that it becomes the second object in the output sequence.
2. Replace the remaining objects in the input sequence with copies of themselves, shifted one position to the left. This means that the second object in the input sequence becomes the first object in the output sequence, and so on.
3. Change the color of each object in the output sequence to color 3.

Applying these steps to the input sequence results in the following output sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3].

Therefore, the transformation rule for this problem can be expressed as follows:

Transform(input, output) = {
    shift_first_object_one_position_to_right(),
    replace_remaining_objects_with_copies_shifted_one_position_to_left(),
    change_color_of_each_object_to_color_3()
}

Note that this transformation rule is just an approximation, and there may be more complex patterns involved in the actual transformation. However, based on the given input-output pairs, this rule seems to capture the essential features of the transformation.
