The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9, where 1 represents the background color and 9 represents the object color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their starting index in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves applying a series of logical rules to the input sequence, which are as follows:\n\n1. Move any object that overlaps with another object by at least one pixel to the right.\n2. If an object overlaps with another object and they are aligned horizontally, move the smaller object to the right.\n3. Scale any object by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., horizontal and vertical).\n4. Remove any object that is completely contained within another object.\n5. Copy any object and paste it after the last object in the sequence.\n6. Recolor any object that is touching the border of the sequence to match the background color.\n7. Sort the objects in the sequence based on their size from largest to smallest.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to rearrange the objects in the sequence based on their size and position, while also adjusting their color and shape. The transformation does not change the total number of objects in the sequence, but rather redistributes them according to their size and position.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the logical rules listed above to each object.\n3. For each object, update its position, size, and color in the output sequence accordingly.\n4. Once all objects have been processed, return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere's how the transformation should be applied to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nStep 1: Initialize the output sequence `output` to the same length as the input sequence.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through the input sequence, applying the logical rules:\n\n* Move any object that overlaps with another object to the right (no action required in this case).\n* Scale any object by a factor of 2 in both directions (no action required in this case).\n* Remove any object that is completely contained within another object (no action required in this case).\n* Copy any object and paste it after the last object in the sequence (no action required in this case).\n* Recolor any object that is touching the border of the sequence to match the background color (no action required in this case).\n* Sort the objects in the sequence based on their size from largest to smallest (no action required in this case).\n\nStep 3: Update the output sequence `output` accordingly:\n\n* Set the color of the first object to 5 (since it is the only object in the sequence).\n* Set the position of the second object to 5 (since it overlaps with the first object).\n* Set the size of the third object to 5 (since it overlaps with the second object).\n* Set the position of the fourth object to 10 (since it overlaps with the third object).\n* Set the size of the fifth object to 5 (since it overlaps with the fourth object).\n* Set the position of the sixth object to 15 (since it overlaps with the fifth object).\n* Set the size of the seventh object to 5 (since it overlaps with the sixth object).\n\nOutput: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nTherefore, the transformation applied to the given input sequence results in the output sequence `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`."
