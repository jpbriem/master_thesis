You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include size, position, and color. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, hollowing, copying, recoloring, and aligning them. The noise pixels are also taken into account during the transformation process.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).
2. Apply the necessary operations to each object based on the transformation pattern (e.g., move, scale, hollow, copy, recolor).
3. Align the objects with respect to each other and the background color.
4. Sort the objects based on their size and position.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each iteration of the input sequence.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is to take an input sequence of pixels and transform it into an output sequence of pixels by applying various operations to the objects in the input sequence. The operations involve manipulating the size, position, and color of the objects, as well as aligning them with respect to each other and the background color.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Copy the input sequence and make it the variable 'input'.
2. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).
3. Apply the necessary operations to each object based on the transformation pattern (e.g., move, scale, hollow, copy, recolor).
4. Align the objects with respect to each other and the background color.
5. Sort the objects based on their size and position.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each iteration of the input sequence.
7. The resulting output sequence will be the transformed input sequence.

**Transformation**

Here's how to perform the transformation for the given input sequence:

1. Input sequence: `[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
2. Identify the objects in the input sequence:
	* Object 1: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
	* Object 2: {color: 5, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}
	* Object 3: {color: 6, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}
3. Apply the necessary operations to each object:
	* Move Object 1 to the right by 2 pixels.
	* Scale Object 2 up by a factor of 2 in both directions.
	* Hollow out Object 3 by removing the center 2x2 block of pixels.
4. Align the objects with respect to each other and the background color:
	* Object 1 is aligned with Object 2 at the top and left edges.
	* Object 2 is aligned with Object 3 at the bottom edge.
5. Sort the objects based on their size and position:
	* Object 1 is sorted first based on its size (2x2) and position (top left).
	* Object 2 is sorted second based on its size (2x2) and position (bottom).
	* Object 3 is sorted third based on its size (2x2) and position (center).
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each iteration of the input sequence.

The resulting output sequence will be:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "Regarding the first example, the input sequence contains three objects: Object 1, Object 2, and Object 3. Object 1 is moved to the right by 2 pixels, while Object 2 is scaled up by a factor of 2 in both directions. Object 3 is hollowed out by removing the center 2x2 block of pixels. After alignment and sorting, the output sequence consists of four objects: Object 1, Object 2, Object 3, and Object 4.",
    "Example_2": "..."
  },

    "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color."
  },
