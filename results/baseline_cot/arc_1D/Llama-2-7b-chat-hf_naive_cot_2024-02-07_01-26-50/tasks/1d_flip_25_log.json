The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here are some observations and hypotheses about the transformation process:\n\n* Pixels with the same color as the background (i.e., 0) remain unchanged in both the input and output sequences.\n* Pixels with a color different from the background are either moved, resized, or recolored based on their relative positions and distances from other colored pixels.\n* The distance metric used to determine the similarity between pixels may be Euclidean or Manhattan distance, as the transformation patterns do not seem to involve any complex geometric operations.\n* The color of a pixel can be modified based on the presence of other colored pixels nearby. For instance, if there is a red pixel next to a green pixel, the green pixel may become blue instead of staying green.\n\nWith these assumptions in mind, here's a step-by-step guide to transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Copy the input sequence and create a new empty sequence of the same length.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence, applying the necessary transformations based on the color and spatial relationships with other pixels. For example, if a pixel has the same color as the background, skip it; otherwise, apply the appropriate transformation rule (e.g., move, resize, recolor).\n\nStep 3: Once all pixels have been transformed, append the resulting pixel values to the new empty sequence. This will give us the output sequence.\n\nNow, let me provide more detailed descriptions of the transformation rules for each type of object in the input sequence:\n\nObject 1: Move\n\n* If the current pixel has the same color as the background, do nothing.\n* Otherwise, move the pixel one position ahead in the sequence.\n\nObject 2: Scale\n\n* If the current pixel has the same color as the background, double its value.\n* Otherwise, scale the pixel value by a factor equal to the distance between the current pixel and the nearest colored pixel.\n\nObject 3: Remove\n\n* If the current pixel has the same color as the background, remove it from the sequence.\n* Otherwise, keep the pixel unchanged.\n\nObject 4: Recolor\n\n* If the current pixel has the same color as the background, change its value to the average color of all colored pixels next to it.\n* Otherwise, keep the pixel unchanged.\n\nObject 5: Copy\n\n* If the current pixel has the same color as the background, copy the next pixel in the sequence.\n* Otherwise, copy the current pixel unchanged.\n\nObject 6: Alignment\n\n* If the current pixel has the same color as the background, align it with the nearest colored pixel.\n* Otherwise, keep the pixel unchanged.\n\nObject 7: Overlap\n\n* If the current pixel overlaps with another colored pixel, change its value to the average color of the overlapping pixels.\n* Otherwise, keep the pixel unchanged.\n\nObject 8: Containment\n\n* If the current pixel contains another colored pixel, change its value to the average color of the contained pixel.\n* Otherwise, keep the pixel unchanged.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON response for the given input sequence:\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where 6 pixels are colored blue, 2 pixels are colored red, and 2 pixels are colored green. The output sequence has 10 pixels as well, where 6 pixels are still colored blue, but the two red pixels have merged into a single red pixel, and the two green pixels have merged into a single green pixel.\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, the input sequence consists of 10 pixels, where 8 pixels are colored blue, 1 pixel is colored red, and 1 pixel is colored yellow. The output sequence has 10 pixels as well, where 8 pixels are still colored blue, but the red pixel has moved to the right and become larger, and the yellow pixel has remained unchanged.\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"Move, scale, remove, recolor, copy, alignment, overlap, containment\",\n  \"instructions\": \"Transform the input sequence by applying the necessary transformation rules based on the color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Keep track of the position and size of each pixel in the output sequence.\",\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, there are 8 objects in total: 4 blue pixels, 2 red pixels, and 2 green pixels. Each object has a unique set of transformation rules based on its color and spatial relationships with other objects.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"After applying the transformation rules, the blue pixels have increased in size and moved slightly towards the left, while the red pixel has merged with the adjacent red pixel to form a larger red pixel. The green pixel has also merged with the adjacent green pixel to form a larger green pixel.\",\n    \"output\": \"[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n  },\n  \"test_output\": \"[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!
