[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 11 zeros and 7 ones, while the output sequence consists of 11 zeros and 7 ones as well. There is no obvious pattern here.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of alternating 5s and 0s, while the output sequence consists of the same pattern but with all 5s replaced by 0s.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of a single object (value = 8) surrounded by zeros, while the output sequence consists of the same object surrounded by zeros again.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves replacing objects in the input sequence with their neighbors in the output sequence. Specifically, if an object appears at index i in the input sequence, its neighbor at index i+1 in the output sequence will replace it. This process continues until all objects in the input sequence have been replaced by their neighbors in the output sequence.

Now, let's apply this transformation to a new input sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Using the above transformation pattern, we can see that the first object (value = 5) will be replaced by its neighbor at index 1 (value = 0), the second object (value = 5) will be replaced by its neighbor at index 2 (value = 0), and so on. Therefore, the transformed output sequence will be:

Output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As requested, I will provide the description, overall pattern, instructions, and transformation for the given input sequence:

Description: The input sequence consists of 16 objects, each with a value between 0 and 9. The objects are arranged in a grid, with each object separated from its neighbors by one position. The objects are either 0 or 5, and there are no gaps between them.

Overall pattern: The transformation involves replacing each object in the input sequence with its neighbor in the output sequence. If an object appears at index i in the input sequence, its neighbor at index i+1 in the output sequence will replace it.

Instructions: Given a new input sequence, transform it into its corresponding output sequence using the above transformation pattern.

Transformation: Copy the input sequence and rename it as the "input" sequence. Then, iterate through each element in the input sequence and replace it with its neighbor in the output sequence, according to the transformation pattern described above. Finally, return the resulting output sequence as the answer.
