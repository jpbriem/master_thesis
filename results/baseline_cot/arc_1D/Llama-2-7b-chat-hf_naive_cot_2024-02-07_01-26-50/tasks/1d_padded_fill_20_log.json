The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

The transformation appears to follow a simple pattern, where certain operations are applied to the input sequence depending on the color values of the pixels.\n\nHere are some observations and hypotheses about the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Objects: It seems that the transformation pattern involves identifying objects in the input sequence based on their color values. Specifically, there are two types of objects:\n\t* Small objects: These are objects that have a small size (i.e., they occupy only a few pixels in the input sequence). Their color values are always even numbers (i.e., 2, 4, 6, etc.).\n\t* Large objects: These are objects that have a large size (i.e., they occupy several pixels in the input sequence). Their color values are always odd numbers (i.e., 1, 3, 5, etc.).\n2. Relationships between objects: Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that the transformation pattern involves maintaining relationships between objects in the input sequence. For example:\n\t* Overlap: If two small objects overlap in the input sequence, their color values will be combined in the output sequence. Specifically, if the color value of one small object is even and the color value of the other small object is odd, their color values will be added together in the output sequence.\n\t* Containment: If a small object contains another small object, the contained object will have a larger size in the output sequence than in the input sequence.\n3. Noise pixels: It seems that noise pixels are introduced in the input sequence to disrupt the formation of objects. These noise pixels have random color values between 0 and 8 (inclusive), and their presence does not affect the transformation pattern.\n4. Arithmetic operations: Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that arithmetic operations are involved in the transformation pattern. Specifically, the output sequence may be generated by performing counting and sorting operations on the input sequence.\n\nGiven these observations and hypotheses, here is a step-by-step approach to transforming a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color values. Small objects have even color values, while large objects have odd color values.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationships between objects in the input sequence based on the observed patterns. For example, check for overlap and containment between objects.\n\nStep 3: Perform counting and sorting operations on the input sequence to generate the output sequence. This may involve adding up the color values of small objects that overlap, and sorting the output sequence based on the color values of the large objects.\n\nStep 4: Introduce noise pixels in the input sequence to disrupt the formation of objects.\n\nStep 5: Transform the input sequence into the output sequence using the above steps.\n\nIn summary, the transformation pattern involves identifying objects in the input sequence based on their color values, maintaining relationships between objects, performing counting and sorting operations, introducing noise pixels, and transforming the input sequence into the output sequence."
