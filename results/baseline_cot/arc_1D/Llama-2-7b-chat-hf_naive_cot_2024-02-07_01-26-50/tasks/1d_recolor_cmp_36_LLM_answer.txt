You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their index in the sequence.

The transformation from input to output involves applying a series of logical rules to the input sequence, which are as follows:

* Move an object to the right by one pixel if there is no object to the left of it.
* If there are two or more objects touching each other, merge them into a single object.
* If there is an object at the edge of the sequence (i.e., at index 0 or n-1), remove it.
* If there are two or more objects of the same color adjacent to each other, merge them into a single object.
* If there is an object of color 2 at the beginning or end of the sequence, move it to the middle of the sequence.
* If there are two or more objects of color 0 adjacent to each other, merge them into a single object.

Using these rules, we can transform the input sequence into the output sequence shown above.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation is to move objects around, merge objects, and remove unnecessary objects. The final output sequence has fewer objects than the input sequence, and the objects are arranged in a different way.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the logical rules listed above to each object.
3. For each object, update the position and size of the object in the output sequence accordingly.
4. Repeat step 2 until the entire input sequence has been processed.
5. Return the resulting output sequence.

**Transformation**

Here is the detailed transformation process for the given input sequence:

1. Input sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]`
2. Apply rule 1: Move object at index 2 to the right by one pixel because there is no object to the left of it. New position: `2`.
3. Apply rule 2: Merge objects at indices 2 and 3 because they are touching each other. New position: `2`.
4. Apply rule 3: Remove object at index 0 because it is at the edge of the sequence.
5. Apply rule 4: Merge objects at indices 2 and 4 because they are of the same color and adjacent to each other. New position: `2`.
6. Apply rule 5: Move object at index 2 to the middle of the sequence because it is of color 2 and at the beginning of the sequence. New position: `1`.
7. Apply rule 6: Merge objects at indices 0 and 2 because they are of the same color and adjacent to each other. New position: `2`.
8. Repeat step 7 until the entire input sequence has been processed.
9. Output sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
