The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the input and output sequences consist of identical patterns of zeros and ones, with some objects (represented by non-zero elements) appearing repeatedly throughout the sequence. Moreover, the objects seem to be aligned horizontally and vertically in both the input and output sequences.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSimilar to the previous example, the input and output sequences in this example also consist of identical patterns of zeros and ones, with some objects (represented by non-zero elements) appearing repeatedly throughout the sequence. However, there seems to be a slight shift in the position of the objects in the output sequence compared to the input sequence.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn this example, the input and output sequences again consist of identical patterns of zeros and ones, but with some objects (represented by non-zero elements) appearing more frequently in the output sequence than in the input sequence. Additionally, there seems to be a slight rotation of the objects in the output sequence compared to the input sequence.\n\nNow, based on these observations, I will attempt to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions. In this case, the objects are represented by non-zero elements, and their positions are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nStep 2: Determine the size and position of each object in the input sequence. This involves calculating the number of consecutive non-zero elements that make up each object and their starting index in the sequence.\n\nStep 3: Apply the necessary transformation actions to each object in the input sequence, taking into account the observed patterns and relationships between objects in the input-output pairs provided earlier. These transformation actions may include moving, scaling, rotating, removing, copying, and recoloring the objects.\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no further changes occur in the output sequence.\n\nUsing these steps, I will now transform the given test input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTransformed Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs expected, the transformed output sequence consists of identical patterns of zeros and ones as the input sequence, with no changes occurring in the sequence after applying the transformation actions. Therefore, the transformation rule for this problem is simply to copy the input sequence without making any changes."
