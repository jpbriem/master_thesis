[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

Firstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:

* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9, representing the background color or an object, respectively. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9, indicating that the objects in the input sequence remain unchanged in the output sequence.
* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 11 elements, where each element is either 0 or 2, representing the background color or an object, respectively. The output sequence also consists of 11 elements, where each element is either 0 or 2, indicating that the objects in the input sequence remain unchanged in the output sequence, except for one object that has been moved one position to the right.
* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 9 elements, where each element is either 0 or 8, representing the background color or an object, respectively. The output sequence also consists of 9 elements, where each element is either 0 or 8, indicating that the objects in the input sequence remain unchanged in the output sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that the simplest possible relation between input and output is that the objects in the input sequence remain unchanged in the output sequence, unless they are explicitly moved or resized. Therefore, my inference is that the transformation rule for this problem is simply to copy the input sequence without making any changes to the objects.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to a new input sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:
```markdown
[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Using the transformation rule we derived earlier, we can transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "Regarding the first example, the input sequence consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9, representing the background color or an object, respectively. The output sequence also consists of 10 elements, where each element is either 0 or 9, indicating that the objects in the input sequence remain unchanged in the output sequence.",
    "Example_2": "..."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Copy the input sequence without making any changes to the objects",
  "instructions": "Transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence by copying the input sequence without making any changes to the objects.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[copy the test case input sequence from the task.]",
    "object_description": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.",
    "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.",
    "output": "[create the resulting test output sequence.]"
  },
  "test_output": "[return the created test output sequence in numpy array format.]"
}
```
In summary, the simplest possible relation between input and output is to copy the input sequence without making any changes to the objects. By applying this transformation rule to a new input sequence, we get the same output sequence as in the examples provided.
