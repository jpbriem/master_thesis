The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2.\nIn the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 0), we need to move Object 1 to Position 2.\n\nStep 2: Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\nObject 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. By scaling it by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, we can make it twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 3: Remove Object 3.\nObject 3 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8. Since it is located at the same position as Object 2, we can simply remove it from the sequence.\n\nStep 4: Recolor Object 1 to have a color of 9.\nIn the input sequence, Object 1 has a color of 2. By recoloring it to have a color of 9, we can give it a completely different appearance.\n\nStep 5: Copy Object 4 and paste it after Object 1.\nObject 4 has a starting index of 9 and an ending index of 9. By copying it and pasting it after Object 1, we can create a new object that is identical to Object 4 but located after Object 1.\n\nStep 6: Move Object 5 to Position 4.\nObject 5 has a starting index of 10 and an ending index of 10. Since the starting index of Object 5 is greater than the starting index of Object 4 (which is 4), we need to move Object 5 to Position 4.\n\nStep 7: Scale Object 6 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.\nObject 6 has a starting index of 11 and an ending index of 11. By scaling it by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, we can make it twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 8: Remove Object 7.\nObject 7 has a starting index of 12 and an ending index of 12. Since it is located at the same position as Object 6, we can simply remove it from the sequence.\n\nStep 9: Recolor Object 2 to have a color of 0.\nIn the input sequence, Object 2 has a color of 3. By recoloring it to have a color of 0, we can give it a completely different appearance.\n\nStep 10: Copy Object 8 and paste it before Object 1.\nObject 8 has a starting index of 13 and an ending index of 13. By copying it and pasting it before Object 1, we can create a new object that is identical to Object 8 but located before Object 1.\n\nAnd there you have it! By following these steps, we can transform the input sequence into the output sequence.\n\nRegarding the overall pattern, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence in a specific order, with each operation affecting only a subset of the objects in the sequence. The operations include moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. The order in which the operations are applied matters, as some operations may depend on the positions of other objects in the sequence."
