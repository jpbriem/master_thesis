The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of alternating objects (represented by non-zero values) and noise pixels (represented by zero values). The output sequence also consists of alternating objects and noise pixels, but with some slight modifications. Specifically, each object in the input sequence has been scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, and some noise pixels have been added or removed.\n* Example_2: Similar to Example_1, the input sequence consists of alternating objects and noise pixels. However, in this case, each object has been rotated by 90 degrees clockwise before being scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n* Example_3: This is similar to Example_1, but with a different set of objects. Instead of scaling up the objects by a factor of 2, they have been shifted by 7 pixels in one dimension.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves modifying the size, position, and color of the objects in the input sequence, while also adding or removing noise pixels. Additionally, there may be some rotation or shifting involved in the transformation.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to transform a new input sequence. Suppose we have the following input sequence:\n\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are two objects: {color: 6, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3} and {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 2}.\n\nStep 2: Modify the size of each object according to the transformation pattern observed in the input-output pairs. Specifically, each object should be scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. So, the modified object {color: 6, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 6} and the modified object {color: 8, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 16} are obtained.\n\nStep 3: Apply any necessary rotations or shifts to the objects. Since no rotation or shift is mentioned in the input-output pairs, we will not perform any here.\n\nStep 4: Add or remove noise pixels as required. Since the input sequence contains only noise pixels at the beginning and end, we will add one more noise pixel at the beginning and end of the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnd the description of the transformation actions would be:\n\n* Move the first object by 3 pixels to the right.\n* Scale the second object by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n* Add a new noise pixel at the beginning of the output sequence.\n* Remove the last noise pixel from the output sequence.\n\nFinally, the instructions for transforming a new input sequence would be:\n\n* Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n* Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\n* Transform the objects according to the transformation pattern observed in the input-output pairs.\n* Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
