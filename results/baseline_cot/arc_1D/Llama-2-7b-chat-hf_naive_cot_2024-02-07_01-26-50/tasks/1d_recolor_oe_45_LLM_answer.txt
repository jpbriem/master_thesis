[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

In the given input sequence, there are three objects:

* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 3}
* Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2}
* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 9, size: 1}

Step 2: Apply transformations to each object

For each object, apply the following transformations based on the given logical rules:

* Move Object 1 one pixel to the right (i.e., at index 10).
* Remove Object 2 (since it has a size of 2 and is located at indices 6 and 7).
* Scale Object 3 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions (i.e., at indices 10 and 11).

Step 3: Update the positions and sizes of the remaining objects

After applying the transformations, the positions and sizes of the remaining objects should be updated accordingly:

* Object 1 now has a size of 3x3=9 pixels and is located at indices 10-8.
* Object 2 no longer exists.
* Object 3 now has a size of 2x2=4 pixels and is located at indices 10-6.

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until no more changes can be made

Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more objects in the input sequence or no more changes can be made to the positions and sizes of the existing objects.

Step 5: Output the transformed sequence

The final output sequence will consist of the transformed objects, along with any noise pixels that may have been introduced during the transformation process.

Here's an example of how the transformation could be applied to the given input sequence:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "Object 1 moves one pixel to the right, Object 2 is removed, and Object 3 is scaled by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions.",
    "Example_2": "Object 1 moves two pixels to the right, Object 2 is removed, and Object 3 is scaled by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Move objects, remove objects, scale objects",
  "instructions": "Apply transformations to each object based on the given logical rules. Repeat until no more changes can be made.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]",
    "object_description": "[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]",
    "transformed_objects": "[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]"
  },
  "test_output": "[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]"
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
