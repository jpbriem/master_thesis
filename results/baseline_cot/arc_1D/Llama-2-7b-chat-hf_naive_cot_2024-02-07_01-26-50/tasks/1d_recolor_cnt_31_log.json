            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving objects, scaling them, removing them, and recoloring them. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nIn the given input sequence, there are two objects: Object 1 (color = 1) and Object 2 (color = 3). Their positions and sizes can be determined by examining the sequence.\n\nStep 2: Apply transformations to the objects\n\nBased on the given transformation patterns, we need to apply the following operations to each object:\n\n* Move Object 1 one position to the right (i.e., from index 0 to index 1).\n* Scale Object 2 by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions (i.e., from size 1 to size 2).\n* Remove Object 1 from the sequence at index 1.\n* Recolor Object 2 to have a color of 2 instead of 3.\n\nStep 3: Determine the final position and size of each object in the output sequence\n\nAfter applying the above transformations, the final positions and sizes of each object in the output sequence can be determined as follows:\n\n* Object 2 has a final position of [2, 2], a final size of [2, 2], and a final color of 2.\n* Object 1 does not appear in the output sequence since it was removed at index 1.\n\nStep 4: Create the output sequence\n\nUsing the updated positions and sizes of each object, we can create the output sequence as follows:\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern for this problem is:\n\nInput \u2192 Output\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
