The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating individual pixels based on their color and spatial relationships with other pixels. Here are some observations and hypotheses about the transformation process:\n\n* Pixels with the same color as the background (i.e., 0) remain unchanged in both the input and output sequences.\n* Pixels with a color different from the background are either moved, resized, or recolored based on their relative positions and distances from other colored pixels.\n* The distance metric used to determine the similarity between pixels may be Euclidean or Manhattan distance, as the transformation patterns do not seem to involve any complex geometric operations.\n* The color of a pixel can be modified based on the presence of other colored pixels nearby. For instance, if there is a red pixel next to a green pixel, the green pixel may turn blue.\n\nWith these assumptions in mind, here is a step-by-step transformation process that could potentially explain the observed input-output pairs:\n\nInput: [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify the background color (0).\n\nStep 2: Find the object(s) in the input sequence. In this case, there is one object with a size of 4 pixels.\n\nStep 3: Determine the position of the object(s) relative to the background. In this case, the object is located at position 1.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the distance between the object and the background using Euclidean distance. In this case, the distance is 4 - 0 = 4.\n\nStep 5: Based on the distance calculation, apply the appropriate transformation rule to the object. Since the distance is greater than 0, the object is moved towards the background. Move the object 4 pixels towards the left until it reaches the background color.\n\nStep 6: Repeat steps 2-5 for each remaining pixel in the input sequence.\n\nOutput: [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can see, the transformed output sequence has the same number of pixels as the input sequence, but the colors have been rearranged according to the transformation rules outlined above.\n\nNow, please provide me with the actual input sequence, and I will perform the necessary transformation steps to obtain the corresponding output sequence."
