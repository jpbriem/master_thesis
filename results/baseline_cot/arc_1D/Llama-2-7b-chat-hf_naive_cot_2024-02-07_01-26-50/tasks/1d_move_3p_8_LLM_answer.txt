You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!

Based on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.

To begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Example_1:
Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

From the output sequence, we can see that the objects in the input sequence have been transformed in the following ways:

* Object 1: The object consisting of two consecutive pixels with value 2 has been moved one position to the right.
* Object 2: The object consisting of three consecutive pixels with value 2 has been scaled by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.

Similarly, for Example_2:

Input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]

And for Example_3:

Input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves moving, scaling, and aligning objects in the input sequence. Additionally, there may be some conditions or arithmetics involved in the transformation process.

Now, let's consider the given input sequence:

Input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the same transformation pattern as seen in the given examples. Therefore, we will perform the following steps:

Step 1: Move the first object (consisting of three consecutive pixels with value 3) one position to the right.

Step 2: Scale the second object (consisting of four consecutive pixels with value 3) by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.

Step 3: Align the third object (consisting of three consecutive pixels with value 3) with the second object, shifting it by one position to the left.

Step 4: Remove the fourth object (consisting of one pixel with value 0) from the sequence.

Step 5: Sort the remaining objects in ascending order of their sizes.

Here's the resulting output sequence:

Output: [0, 3, 6, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the transformation pattern for the given input sequence is:

Overall pattern: Move, scale, align, remove, sort.

I hope this helps you understand the problem better and solve it successfully!
