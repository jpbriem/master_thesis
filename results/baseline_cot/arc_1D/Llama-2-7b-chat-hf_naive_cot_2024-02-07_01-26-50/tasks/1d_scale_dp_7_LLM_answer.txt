You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem! Here's my answer:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties (such as size, position, and color) can be accessed through the `Object` description field.

The transformation pattern between the input and output sequences appears to be based on the following rules:

* Move an object by one pixel in any direction (up, down, left, right).
* Remove an object if it is not adjacent to another object.
* Scale an object by a factor of 2 in either direction (i.e., double or halve its size).
* Copy an object without changing its properties.
* Recolor an object by changing its color to a random value between its original color and white (i.e., the maximum brightness).
* Align two objects vertically or horizontally by moving one of them by a fixed amount (not specified in the given examples).
* Overlap two objects by merging them into a single object with a combined size and color.
* Containment: An object is contained within another object if the containing object has a non-zero area and the contained object has a non-zero area that overlaps with the containing object.

Based on these rules, the transformation actions required to transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence would involve applying the above operations in a sequential manner, starting with the first input pixel and proceeding until the last output pixel is reached.

For example, given a new input sequence `[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8]`, we could apply the following transformation steps:

1. Move the first object (size=2, position=1) by one pixel to the right, so it becomes positioned at index 2.
2. Remove the second object (size=1, position=3) since it is not adjacent to another object.
3. Scale the third object (size=2, position=2) by a factor of 2 in both directions, so it becomes twice as large.
4. Copy the fourth object (size=1, position=4) without changing its properties.
5. Recolor the fifth object (color=3, position=5) by changing its color to a random value between its original color and white.
6. Align the sixth object (size=2, position=6) vertically with the seventh object (size=2, position=7) by moving the seventh object by a fixed amount (not specified in the given examples).
7. Overlap the eighth object (size=2, position=8) with the ninth object (size=1, position=9) by merging them into a single object with a combined size and color.

After applying these transformation steps, the resulting output sequence would be `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
