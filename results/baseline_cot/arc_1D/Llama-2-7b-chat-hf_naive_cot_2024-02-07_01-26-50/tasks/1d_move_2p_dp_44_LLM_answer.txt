You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem! Here's my answer:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel value ranging from 1 to 9 (representing different colors) and 0 (representing the background color). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and their properties include their starting index, ending index, and size.

Based on the given examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and recoloring the objects. Additionally, there may be conditions or noise pixels that affect the transformation process.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the transformation seems to involve manipulating the positions, sizes, and colors of the objects in the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence. The exact nature of these manipulations depends on the specific operation being applied, but they seem to involve some combination of movement, scaling, and recoloring.

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
2. Iterate through each object in the input sequence, applying the appropriate transformation operation based on the object's properties (starting index, ending index, size, and color).
	* If the object is moved, update its position in the output sequence accordingly.
	* If the object is scaled, adjust its size in the output sequence proportionally.
	* If the object is recolored, replace its color in the output sequence with the specified new color.
	* If the object is removed, set its corresponding elements in the output sequence to 0.
3. Repeat step 2 until all objects in the input sequence have been processed.
4. Return the resulting output sequence.

**Transformation**

To perform the transformation, we will need to apply the following operations to each object in the input sequence:

* Move objects by adding their starting index to their ending index.
* Scale objects by multiplying their size by a scalar value.
* Recolor objects by replacing their color with a new color value.
* Remove objects by setting their corresponding elements in the output sequence to 0.

For example, consider the input sequence `[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0]`. Applying the transformation operations above would result in the output sequence `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0]`.

**Test Output**

Using the provided input sequence `['5', '5', '5', '0', '0', '6', '0']`, the transformation produces the output sequence `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0]`.
