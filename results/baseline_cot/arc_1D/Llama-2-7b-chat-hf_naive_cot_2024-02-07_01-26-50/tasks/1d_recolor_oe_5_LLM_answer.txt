You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9, where 1 represents the background color and 9 represents the object color. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their starting index in the sequence.

The transformation from input to output involves applying a series of logical rules to the input sequence, which are as follows:

1. Move any object that overlaps with another object by at least one pixel to the right.
2. If an object overlaps with another object and they are aligned horizontally, move the smaller object to the right.
3. Scale any object by a factor of 2 in both directions (i.e., horizontal and vertical).
4. Remove any object that is completely contained within another object.
5. Copy any object and paste it after the last object in the sequence.
6. Recolor any object that is touching the border of the sequence to match the background color.

Based on these rules, the output sequence is generated by applying the following steps:

1. Initialize the output sequence with the input sequence.
2. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the logic above.
3. Apply the transformation rules to each object in the input sequence.
4. Update the output sequence with the transformed objects.

Here are the detailed instructions for transforming a new input sequence:

1. Copy the input sequence and create a new empty sequence.
2. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence and apply the transformation rules to determine the new position, size, and color of each object.
3. Add the transformed objects to the new sequence.
4. Return the new sequence as the output.

Finally, here is the JSON representation of the solution:
```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "The input sequence contains 8 objects of size 5x5, arranged in a grid. After applying the transformation rules, the objects are moved, resized, and recolored to produce the output sequence.",
    "Example_2": "The input sequence contains 16 objects of size 7x7, arranged in a grid. After applying the transformation rules, the objects are moved, resized, and recolored to produce the output sequence."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Apply transformation rules to objects in the input sequence to produce the output sequence",
  "instructions": "Copy the input sequence, iterate through each pixel, apply transformation rules to determine new position, size, and color of each object, add transformed objects to new sequence, return new sequence as output.",

    "object_description": "Objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color. Size and position of each object are determined by starting index and ending index, respectively.",
    "transformed_objects": "After applying transformation rules, the objects are moved, resized, and recolored to produce the output sequence.",
    "output": "[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]"
  },
  "test_output": "[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]"
