The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\nStep 1: Move Object 1 to Position 2.\nIn the input sequence, Object 1 has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Since the starting index of Object 1 is less than the starting index of Object 2 (which is 0), we need to move Object 1 to Position 2. To do this, we simply shift the entire Object 1 section to the right by 2 positions.\n\nStep 2: Scale Object 2 by a Factor of 2.\nObject 2 has a starting index of 4 and an ending index of 4. We need to scale it by a factor of 2, so we multiply each value in Object 2 by 2. This will make Object 2 twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 3: Remove Object 3.\nObject 3 has a starting index of 6 and an ending index of 6. Since the ending index of Object 3 is equal to the starting index of Object 3, we can safely remove it from the sequence since there are no more elements to consider.\n\nStep 4: Recolor Object 1.\nObject 1 has a color of 2, and we want to change its color to 7. So, we simply replace each value in Object 1 with a value that is 5 greater than its original value (i.e., 2 + 5 = 7).\n\nStep 5: Move Object 2 to Position 7.\nSince Object 2 has already been scaled by a factor of 2, we don't need to apply any further scaling operations. However, we do need to move Object 2 to Position 7 since its starting index is now greater than the starting index of Object 1. To do this, we simply shift the entire Object 2 section to the right by 5 positions (since there are 5 positions between Object 1 and Object 2).\n\nStep 6: Remove Object 4.\nObject 4 has a starting index of 8 and an ending index of 8. Since the ending index of Object 4 is equal to the starting index of Object 4, we can safely remove it from the sequence since there are no more elements to consider.\n\nStep 7: Scale Object 5 by a Factor of 2.\nObject 5 has a starting index of 10 and an ending index of 10. We need to scale it by a factor of 2, so we multiply each value in Object 5 by 2. This will make Object 5 twice as large as it was originally.\n\nStep 8: Recolor Object 3.\nObject 3 has a color of 2, and we want to change its color to 7. So, we simply replace each value in Object 3 with a value that is 5 greater than its original value (i.e., 2 + 5 = 7).\n\nStep 9: Move Object 6 to Position 9.\nSince Object 6 has already been scaled by a factor of 2, we don't need to apply any further scaling operations. However, we do need to move Object 6 to Position 9 since its starting index is now greater than the starting index of Object 5. To do this, we simply shift the entire Object 6 section to the right by 4 positions (since there are 4 positions between Object 5 and Object 6).\n\nAnd that's it! By applying these steps to the input sequence, we can transform it into the output sequence.\n\nHere's the final transformed sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nOutput: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]"
