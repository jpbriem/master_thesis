The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-8) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are defined as contiguous blocks of the same color, where each block has a non-zero size. The transformation pattern involves applying various operations to the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and removing objects. The output sequence is obtained by applying these operations in a specific way.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is as follows:\n\n1. Move the objects in the input sequence by a fixed amount (either left or right).\n2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by a factor (either multiplying or dividing their size).\n3. Remove some of the objects in the input sequence based on a set of conditions (such as overlap or containment).\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 multiple times, with the number of repetitions determined by a condition (such as the number of objects remaining in the sequence).\n5. End the transformation by copying the last object in the input sequence to the output sequence.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the transformation operations in the following order:\na. Move the current object in the input sequence by a fixed amount (left or right).\nb. Scale the current object in the input sequence by a factor (multiply or divide its size).\nc. Check if the current object overlaps with any other object in the input sequence, and remove it if necessary.\nd. Repeat steps b and c until no more objects remain in the input sequence.\ne. Copy the last object in the input sequence to the output sequence.\n3. End the iteration when the input sequence is exhausted.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere are the detailed instructions for each transformation operation:\n\n* **Move**: Move the current object in the input sequence by a fixed amount (either left or right) by shifting its color value by the specified amount.\n* **Scale**: Scale the current object in the input sequence by a factor (multiply or divide its size) by adjusting its color value accordingly.\n* **Remove**: Check if the current object overlaps with any other object in the input sequence, and remove it if necessary. To do this, compare the color values of the current object with those of its neighbors, and remove the object if they overlap.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nUsing the given input sequence, here is the resulting test output sequence:\n```json\n[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, and the colors are arranged in the same way as the input sequence."
