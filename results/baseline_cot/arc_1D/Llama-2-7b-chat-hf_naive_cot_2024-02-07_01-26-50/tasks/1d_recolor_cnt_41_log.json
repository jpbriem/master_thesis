The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output sequences and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom this example, we can observe that the objects in the input sequence are combined and resized according to some rule. Specifically, each object is either doubled in size or merged with another object. Additionally, there seems to be a rule where if two adjacent objects have the same color, they are merged into a single object.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: `[0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, it appears that the objects in the input sequence are aligned horizontally and their sizes are adjusted accordingly. When two adjacent objects have the same color, they are merged into a single object.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn this example, it seems that the objects in the input sequence are randomly placed and resized. There doesn't appear to be any specific rule governing the placement and scaling of the objects.\n\nNow, let's apply these insights to a new input sequence:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the previous examples, I will make the following transformations:\n\n* Combine adjacent objects of the same color into a single object.\n* Resize the objects according to the following rule: if an object has a size of 4, resize it to a size of 6; otherwise, keep the original size.\n* Align the objects horizontally.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, the resulting output sequence would be:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the transformation action for a new input sequence would be:\n\nTransformation: Copy the input sequence, apply the above transformations, and rearrange the resulting sequence in the correct order.\n\nFinally, regarding the instruction to provide a description of the needed transformation actions, I will do so as follows:\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the input sequence.\n2. Apply the following transformations:\na. Combine adjacent objects of the same color into a single object.\nb. Resize the objects according to the following rule: if an object has a size of 4, resize it to a size of 6; otherwise, keep the original size.\nc. Align the objects horizontally.\n3. Rearrange the resulting sequence in the correct order.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
