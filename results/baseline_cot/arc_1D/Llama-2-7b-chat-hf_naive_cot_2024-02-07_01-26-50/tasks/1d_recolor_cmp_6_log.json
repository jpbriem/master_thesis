            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves manipulating the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the objects seem to be moved, resized, and aligned with each other. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence\n\nFrom the given input sequence, we can identify three objects:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 9, 0]\n* Object 2: [0, 0, 9]\n* Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 9]\n\nStep 2: Describe the transformation actions for each object\n\nFor each object, we need to apply a set of transformation actions to change its properties. Based on the given output sequences, here are the transformation actions I would apply:\n\n* Object 1: Move 2 positions to the right, resize to half the original size, align with Object 2.\n* Object 2: Move 1 position to the left, resize to twice the original size, align with Object 3.\n* Object 3: Remove the last element, move 1 position to the left, resize to the original size.\n\nStep 3: Apply the transformation actions to the input sequence\n\nUsing the transformation actions described above, we can now apply them to the input sequence. Here's how the sequence would look after applying these actions:\n\nInput sequence: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9]\n\nAs you can see, the objects in the input sequence have been transformed according to the specified rules.\n\nOverall pattern:\nThe overall pattern of the transformation appears to be based on moving, resizing, and aligning objects with each other. The specific rules for each object are:\n\n* Move 1-2 positions to the right (or left).\n* Resize by a factor of 2 (or half).\n* Align with another object.\n\nInstructions:\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Apply the transformation actions described above to each object.\n3. Repeat steps 1-2 until no more objects remain.\n\nTransformation:\nCopy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n\nObject description:\nRegarding the test input, there are three objects:\n\n* Object 1: [0, 9, 0]\n* Object 2: [0, 0, 9]\n* Object 3: [0, 0, 0, 9]\n\nEach object has the following properties:\n\n* Size: Original size.\n* Position: Starting position in the sequence.\n* Color: Original color.\n\nTransformed objects:\nAfter applying the transformation actions described above, the objects in the output sequence will have the following properties:\n\n* Size: Half the original size.\n* Position: Aligned with another object.\n* Color: Unchanged.\n\nOutput sequence: Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!"
