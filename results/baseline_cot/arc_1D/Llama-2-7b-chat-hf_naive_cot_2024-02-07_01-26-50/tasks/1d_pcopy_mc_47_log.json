The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the instructions provided, I will try to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output, and then transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.\n\nFirstly, let me analyze the input-output pairs provided:\n\n* Example_1: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 2) arranged in a row. The output sequence also consists of 8 zeros and 2 non-zeros (color 2) arranged in a row, but with the non-zeros shifted one position to the right compared to the input.\n* Example_2: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 4 non-zeros (colors 4 and 9) arranged in a square shape. The output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 4 non-zeros (colors 4 and 9) arranged in a square shape, but with some of the non-zeros shifted one position to the left or top compared to the input.\n* Example_3: The input sequence consists of 8 zeros and 5 non-zeros (colors 1, 3, and 5) arranged in a column. The output sequence consists of 8 zeros and 5 non-zeros (colors 1, 3, and 5) arranged in a column, but with some of the non-zeros shifted one position to the right compared to the input.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the transformation pattern involves shifting or moving the non-zeros in the input sequence to corresponding positions in the output sequence. Additionally, the colors of the non-zeros seem to be preserved during the transformation process.\n\nNow, let's consider a new input sequence [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. To transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Shift the non-zero elements in the input sequence to the corresponding positions in the output sequence. In this case, there is only one non-zero element (color 7), so we simply shift it one position to the right in the output sequence.\n\nStep 2: Preserve the colors of the non-zeros in the output sequence. Since the colors of the non-zeros in the input sequence are consistent throughout, we can simply preserve their colors in the output sequence without any modifications.\n\nStep 3: Repeat Step 1 and Step 2 until no more non-zeros remain in the input sequence. Since there are no more non-zeros in the input sequence after applying Steps 1 and 2, we stop here.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence for the given input sequence is:\n[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
