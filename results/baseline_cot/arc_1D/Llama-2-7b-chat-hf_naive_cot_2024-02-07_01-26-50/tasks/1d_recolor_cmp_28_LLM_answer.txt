You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences are both 1D arrays of integers, where each integer represents a pixel color (0-9) or the background color (0). The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the relations between them include moving, scaling, and overlapping. The noise pixels are represented by random integers between 0 and 9.

To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.
2. Scale the objects by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions.
3. Move the objects towards the center of the sequence by a distance of 2 in both x and y directions.
4. Overlap the objects by shifting them towards each other by a distance of 1 in both x and y directions.
5. Remove any noise pixels.
6. Recolor the output sequence using the original color palette.

Here's the detailed explanation of each step:

1. **Identify the objects**: In the input sequence, there are three objects: Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3. Their positions are as follows:
	* Object_1: [0, 2], [2, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8]
	* Object_2: [0, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8], [8, 10]
	* Object_3: [0, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8], [8, 10]
2. **Scale the objects**: We scale each object by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions. This means that the width and height of each object are doubled.
3. **Move the objects towards the center**: We move each object towards the center of the sequence by a distance of 2 in both x and y directions. This means that the center of each object is now at [1, 1].
4. **Overlap the objects**: We overlap the objects by shifting them towards each other by a distance of 1 in both x and y directions. This means that the edges of each object overlap with the edges of the other objects.
5. **Remove any noise pixels**: We remove any noise pixels (i.e., pixels with a value outside the range [0, 9]) from the sequence.
6. **Recolor the output sequence**: Finally, we recolor the output sequence using the original color palette.

The resulting output sequence is:
```json
[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Note that the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, but the values are different.
