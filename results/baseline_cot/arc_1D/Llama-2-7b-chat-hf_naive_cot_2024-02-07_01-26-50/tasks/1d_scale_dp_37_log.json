The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this problem!\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels into an equivalent output sequence, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (representing different colors) and 0 represents the background color. The input and output sequences may have different lengths, and adjacent pixels of the same color are considered objects.\n\nTo begin with, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:\n\nExample_1:\nInput: `[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0]`\nOutput: `[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0]`\n\nFrom the input sequence, we can see that there are three objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 2, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\nThe output sequence also contains these objects, but with some modifications:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\n* Object 2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 2, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}\n\nIt appears that the transformation pattern involves moving objects around and scaling them up or down. Specifically, object 1 is moved two positions to the right, object 2 is shrunk by half, and object 3 is expanded by a factor of 2.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to the given input sequence:\n\nInput: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence. There are four objects:\n\n* Object 1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}\n* Object 2: {color: 7, start_index: 5, end_index: 6, size: 2}\n* Object 3: {color: 0, start_index: 7, end_index: 7, size: 1}\n* Object 4: {color: 2, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}\n\nStep 2: Apply the transformation rules to each object. Based on the given pattern, we can modify the objects as follows:\n\n* Object 1: Move one position to the right, expand by a factor of 2.\n* Object 2: Shrink by half in both directions.\n* Object 3: Stay at the same position and size.\n* Object 4: Expand by a factor of 2 in both directions.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, we get the output sequence:\n\nOutput: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2]`\n\nTherefore, the transformation pattern involves moving objects around and scaling them up or down. By applying these transformations repeatedly to the input sequence, we can generate the output sequence.\n\nFor the remaining input-output pairs, we can apply similar transformations based on the given pattern. However, keep in mind that the specific rules may vary depending on the actual problem you're trying to solve."
