prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I can help you with this problem! Here's my solution:

**Description**

The input and output sequences share a similar pattern, where each object (represented by a contiguous sequence of identical values) is transformed in a consistent manner. Specifically, the objects are either moved, resized, or rotated, while maintaining their overall shape and position relative to each other.

**Overall Pattern**

The overall pattern of the input and output sequences can be described as follows:

* Each object in the input sequence is transformed according to a specific rule, depending on its size and position.
* The size of an object is increased or decreased by a fixed amount (either +1 or -1).
* The position of an object is shifted horizontally by a fixed amount (either +1 or -1).
* The orientation of an object is rotated by a fixed angle (either +90 or -90 degrees).

**Instructions**

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions.
2. Determine the size and orientation of each object.
3. Apply the appropriate transformation rule to each object, based on its size and position.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each object in the input sequence.
5. Concatenate the transformed objects into a single output sequence.

**Transformation**

Here are the detailed transformation rules for each type of object:

* **Move**: If an object has a size of 1, it is simply moved horizontally by a fixed amount (either +1 or -1). Otherwise, it is moved by a fraction of its size (based on its original position and size).
* **Hollow**: If an object has a size of 1, it is removed from the sequence. Otherwise, it is shrunk by a factor of 0.5 and its center is shifted by a fixed amount (either +1 or -1).
* **Scale**: If an object has a size of 1, it is scaled up or down by a fixed factor (either +1 or -1). Otherwise, it is scaled by a fraction of its size (based on its original position and size).
* **Remove**: If an object has a size of 1, it is removed from the sequence. Otherwise, it is removed by shifting its center by a fixed amount (either +1 or -1).
* **Copy**: If an object has a size of 1, it is copied and pasted at its original position. Otherwise, it is copied and pasted at a new position, shifted by a fixed amount (either +1 or -1).
* **Recolor**: If an object has a size of 1, it is colored differently (either lightened or darkened). Otherwise, it is colored differently based on its original color and a fixed threshold value.

**Test Output**

Using the given input sequence, the following output sequence is obtained by applying the above transformation rules:
```json
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
```
Note that the output sequence may have a different length than the input sequence, depending on the specific transformation rules applied.
