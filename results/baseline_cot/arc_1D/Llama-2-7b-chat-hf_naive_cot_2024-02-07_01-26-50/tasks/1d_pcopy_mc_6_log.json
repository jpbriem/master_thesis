The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence.

Here's my solution:\n\n**Description**\n\nThe input and output sequences are both 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color and the other numbers represent different pixel colors. The objects in the input sequence are designated by adjacent pixels of the same color, and the size of each object is equal to the number of pixels it covers. The positions of the objects are determined by their indices in the sequence.\n\nThe transformation from input to output involves applying a series of logical rules to the input sequence, which are as follows:\n\n1. Move any object one position to the right if there is no object to the left of it.\n2. If an object overlaps with another object to the right, remove the smaller object.\n3. Scale any object by a factor of 2 in either direction (i.e., horizontally or vertically).\n4. Remove any object that is completely covered by another object.\n5. Copy any object and paste it after the last object in the sequence.\n6. Recolor any object to match the color of the object immediately to the left of it, if there is one.\n7. Sort the objects in the sequence based on their positions.\n\nBased on these rules, the output sequence is generated by applying the above transformations to the input sequence.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\nThe overall pattern of the transformation is to rearrange the objects in the sequence based on their positions and sizes, while also scaling and recoloring them as necessary. The final output sequence has the same number of objects as the input sequence, but their positions and sizes may be different.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Iterate through the input sequence, applying the logical rules listed above to each object.\n3. For each object, update its position and size in the output sequence based on the rules applied.\n4. Repeat step 2 until all objects in the input sequence have been processed.\n5. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\n**Transformation**\n\nHere are the specific transformation actions to apply to the input sequence:\n\n* Copy the input sequence and append it to the beginning of the output sequence.\n* For each object in the input sequence, apply the following actions:\n\t+ If the object is completely covered by another object, remove it from the sequence.\n\t+ Otherwise, move the object one position to the right in the sequence.\n\t+ Scale the object by a factor of 2 in either direction.\n\t+ Recolor the object to match the color of the object immediately to the left of it, if there is one.\n\t+ Sort the object based on its position in the sequence.\n\n**Test Output**\n\nUsing the given input sequence, the resulting output sequence would be:\n```json\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the output sequence has the same number of objects as the input sequence, but their positions and sizes may be different."
