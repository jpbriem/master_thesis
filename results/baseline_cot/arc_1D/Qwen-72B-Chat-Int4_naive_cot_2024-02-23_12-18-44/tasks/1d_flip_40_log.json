            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the object consisting of color 6 has been moved one position to the right, pushing the object consisting of color 2 one position to the left.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the last two digits of the input sequence (i.e., 3 and 4) have swapped positions.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the last three digits of the input sequence (i.e., 5, 6, and 6) have been sorted in ascending order.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve swapping/moving/reshuffling the digits at the end of the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the last digit(s) of the input sequence that need to be rearranged according to the given patterns.\n2. Perform the necessary swap/move operation to achieve the desired output arrangement.\n\nFor Example_1, we would identify the last two digits (i.e., 6 and 2), then move the 6 one position to the right and the 2 one position to the left.\nFor Example_2, we would identify the last two digits (i.e., 3 and 4), then simply swap their positions.\nFor Example_3, we would identify the last three digits (i.e., 5, 6, and 6), then sort them in ascending order.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 consists of color 5 and starts at index 3; Object_2 consists of color 4 and starts at index 4.', 'transformed_objects': 'In the output sequence, Object_1 remains unchanged, but Object_2 changes color to 5 and moves one position to the left.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}"
