prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, three consecutive objects of color 3 (at positions 1-6) were moved one position to the right, creating a gap at position 0. An object of color 2 remained unchanged at position 10.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, five consecutive objects of color 3 (at positions 0-5) were moved four positions to the right, creating gaps at positions 0-3. An object of color 2 remained unchanged at position 10.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, six consecutive objects of color 4 (at positions 1-7) were moved two positions to the right, creating gaps at positions 0-1. An object of color 2 was shifted one position to the left, filling the gap at position 10.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that an initial sequence of non-zero elements (objects), followed by zeros (background), is translated some number of positions to the right while preserving relative order and size of the objects. Gaps are introduced at the beginning of the sequence according to the shift amount. Any existing objects after the initial sequence remain unchanged.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify the longest continuous sequence of non-zero elements (objects) at the beginning of the input sequence.
2. Shift this sequence to the right by a count equal to the index of the next non-zero element.
3. Fill the gaps created at the beginning of the sequence with zeros.
4. Keep any remaining objects at their original positions.

For example, given the input [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2]:

1. Identify the longest continuous sequence of non-zero elements: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3].
2. Shift it to the right by the index of the next non-zero element (position 8): [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3].
3. Fill the gaps with zeros: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3].
4. Keep the remaining object at its original position: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2].', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2]', 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 has color 3, starts at index 2, ends at index 7, and has size 6; Object_2 has color 2, starts at index 10, ends at index 10, and has size 1.', 'transformed_objects': 'Object_1 should have the same color but be shifted to the right by three positions, starting at index 5, ending at index 10, and having size 6. Object_2 should stay at the same position.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2])}
