prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9]



Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, two noise pixels (value 0) were added at the beginning and one was removed at the end. Also, an object of color 9 was moved from index 13 to index 12.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, no changes occurred to the input sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, four noise pixels (value 0) were added at the beginning and three were removed at the end. No other changes occurred.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve adding noise pixels at the beginning and removing them at the end, while also potentially moving an existing object around.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Add `n` noise pixels (value 0) at the beginning of the input sequence, where `n` equals the number of noise pixels removed at the end of the input sequence.
2. If there exists an object of color 9 in the input sequence, identify its starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index`). Move this object one position to the left if it's not already at the beginning of the sequence (i.e., if `start_index > 0`). Otherwise, do nothing.
3. Remove `m` noise pixels (value 0) at the end of the input sequence, where `m` equals the number of noise pixels added at the beginning of the input sequence.

Remember to maintain the total length of the sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 (color 2, size 5), located at indices 0 through 4; Object_2 (color 9, size 1), located at indices 12 and 13.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, Object_1 remains unchanged. Object_2 moves one position to the left (from indices 12 and 13 to indices 11 and 12).', 'output': '[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0])}
