            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence has an object made up of seven consecutive 7s starting at index 6. In the output sequence, this object shifts one position to the right, creating eight consecutive 0s before it.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input sequence starts with six consecutive 6s followed by ten consecutive 0s. In the output sequence, these two segments remain unchanged but get swapped places, so there are now six consecutive 6s after the initial segment of ten consecutive 0s.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input sequence contains thirteen consecutive 5s, while the output sequence begins with two consecutive 0s followed by eleven consecutive 5s.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern involves shifting the leftmost non-zero element (i.e., the first object) in the input sequence to the right until it is adjacent to another non-zero element or reaches the end of the sequence. This results in a gap being created at the beginning of the sequence filled with zeros.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the leftmost non-zero element in the input sequence.\n2. Shift this element and any subsequent identical elements one position to the right.\n3. Fill the vacated space at the beginning of the sequence with a zero.\n4. If the shifted element overlaps with another non-zero element, stop shifting; otherwise, repeat from step 1.\n\nFor example, if the input sequence is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0]`, then shift the leftmost `7` and its duplicates one position to the right, filling the vacated space with a zero.
