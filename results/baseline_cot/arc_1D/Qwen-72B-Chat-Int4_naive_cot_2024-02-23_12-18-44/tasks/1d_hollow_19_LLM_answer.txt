prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has an object of color 3 starting at index 0 and ending at index 2 (inclusive). In the output sequence, this object is moved one position to the right.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence has two objects - one of color 0 starting at index 0 and another of color 5 starting at index 4 and ending at index 8 (inclusive). In the output sequence, the object of color 5 is split into two parts separated by one position of color 0.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence has an object of color 3 spanning across indices 0 to 3 (inclusive). In the output sequence, this object is split into two parts separated by two positions of color 0.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input sequence, there exists an object of non-zero color that spans multiple consecutive indices. This object is modified in some way to create the corresponding output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the object(s) of non-zero color in the input sequence.
2. Determine the specific modification to apply to this/these object(s).
   - If the object consists of a single pixel, leave it unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if the object covers indices i to j (inclusive), modify the object according to the following rule:
     - Insert k positions of color 0 at index i+1, where k is equal to the number of consecutive indices covered by the original object minus 1.
3. Create the output sequence by concatenating the modified object(s) and any remaining zero-valued pixels in their respective order.

Note that the specific modifications applied to the object(s) vary depending on the input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there is an object of color 1 starting at index 0 and ending at index 6 (inclusive)', 'transformed_objects': 'The object of color 1 will be split into two parts separated by five positions of color 0.', 'output': '[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]'}, 'test_output': np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])}
