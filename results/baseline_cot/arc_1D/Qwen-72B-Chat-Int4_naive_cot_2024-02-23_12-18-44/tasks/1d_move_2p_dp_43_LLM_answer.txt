prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has an object composed of color 8 starting at index 1 and ending at index 9, along with two separate noise pixels (value 0) located at indices 0 and 11. In the output sequence, the object shifts one position to the right, pushing the noise pixel at index 0 to index 1 and 2, while preserving the other noise pixel at index 11.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains an object made up of color 4 spanning from index 1 to index 11, followed by three noise pixels at indices 12, 13, and 15. In the output sequence, the object expands one position to the left, incorporating the noise pixel at index 0, effectively shifting it inside the object.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence features an object consisting of color 6 arranged from index 1 through index 11, accompanied by two noise pixels situated at indices 0 and 12. The output sequence displays the object growing one position to the left, merging the initial noise pixel at index 0 into the object itself.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The input-output relationship for these examples involves expanding the given object in the input sequence towards the left by one position, absorbing any preceding noise pixel if present.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify the object in the input sequence, including its starting index, ending index, and color value.
2. Locate any noise pixel(s) before the identified object.
3. Shift the entire object one position to the left, incorporating the noise pixel(s) into the object.
4. Maintain the remaining portion of the input sequence after the shifted object, ensuring no changes occur there.
5. Output the modified sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]', 'object_description': 'In the test input, there exists an object composed of color 2 ranging from index 2 to index 11, with two noise pixels at indices 0 and 12.', 'transformed_objects': 'After transformation, the object should expand to include the noise pixel at index 0, altering its starting index to 1 and maintaining its original color value of 2.', 'output': '[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0])}
