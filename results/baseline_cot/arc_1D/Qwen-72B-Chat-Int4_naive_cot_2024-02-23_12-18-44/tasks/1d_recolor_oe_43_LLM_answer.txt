prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, every group of consecutive 1s in the input sequence is replaced with an equivalent number of 8s in the output sequence. The count of consecutive 1s in each group determines the count of 8s in the corresponding group.', 'Example_2': 'Similar to Example_1, here also we see replacement of groups of consecutive 1s with an equivalent number of 5s. The count of consecutive 1s in each group determines the count of 5s in the corresponding group.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, again the groups of consecutive 1s in the input sequence get replaced with an equivalent number of either 8s or 5s depending upon their positions. Specifically, if the group starts at index less than or equal to 6, it gets converted to 8s; otherwise, it becomes 5s.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern observed across these examples is that groups of consecutive 1s in the input sequence are being replaced with an equivalent number of some other value (either 5s or 8s) in the output sequence. The specific value used depends on the starting index of the group of 1s.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence using this pattern:

1. Identify groups of consecutive 1s in the input sequence.
2. Determine the appropriate value to replace them with, based on the starting index of the group:
   - If the starting index is less than or equal to 6, replace with 8s.
   - Otherwise, replace with 5s.
3. Replace the identified groups accordingly in the input sequence to obtain the final output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are two main types of objects in the input sequence: 0s and 1s. The 0s represent the background color while the 1s form several distinct objects of varying sizes.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, there will still be two types of objects: 0s and the transformed version of the original 1s (which could be either 5s or 8s). These transformed versions maintain their relative positions and sizes but change their color according to the determined value.', 'output': '[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0])}
