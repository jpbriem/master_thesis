prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the object composed of color 7 has been moved one position to the right. Color 9 has also been shifted one position to the left.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the object composed of color 1 has been moved two positions to the right. Color 9 remains stationary.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the object composed of color 4 has been moved three positions to the right. Color 9 remains stationary.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern involves moving an object composed of a specific color (in this case, the last non-zero color before color 9) to the right, while shifting color 9 accordingly to maintain the integrity of the original object count. The number of positions the object moves depends on the index of the initial object.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output:

1. Identify the last non-zero color before color 9.
2. Move the identified object to the right by a number of positions equal to its starting index.
3. Shift color 9 to the left accordingly, maintaining the same distance between it and the moved object.
4. Keep other elements in their respective places.
5. Ensure there are no changes to the number of objects or noise pixels.

For the given test case:', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 ({color: 3, start_index: 2, end_index: 4, size: 3}) and Object_2 ({color: 9, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}).', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation rule, Object_1 will be at position 5-7 (inclusive), and Object_2 will remain unchanged.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}
