prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0]



Test case:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, all occurrences of object with color 3 are moved one position to the left.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, two additional noise pixels (value 0) are inserted at the beginning of the sequence before the first occurrence of the object with color 2.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, six additional noise pixels (value 0) are inserted after the last occurrence of the object with color 1.', 'Example_4': 'In this example, all occurrences of object with color 8 are removed.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The transformation pattern involves moving or removing objects based on their color while adding or removing noise pixels. Specifically, if an object has color 3, it will be moved one position to the left; if an object has color 2, two noise pixels will be added before it; if an object has color 1, six noise pixels will be added after it; if an object has color 8, it will be removed entirely.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output using the identified pattern, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.
2. Check each object's color and apply the appropriate action based on the overall pattern.
   - If the object's color is 3, move it one position to the left.
   - If the object's color is 2, add two noise pixels (value 0) before it.
   - If the object's color is 1, add six noise pixels (value 0) after it.
   - If the object's color is 8, remove the entire object.
3. Combine the modified objects and any remaining noise pixels to create the final output sequence.
4. Ensure the correct sequence length for the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0]', 'object_description': 'There is one object in the input sequence: Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 0, end_index: 9, size: 9}', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation pattern, there are no objects in the output sequence.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0])}
