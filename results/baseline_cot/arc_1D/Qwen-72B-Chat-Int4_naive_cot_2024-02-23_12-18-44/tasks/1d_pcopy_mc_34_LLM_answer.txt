prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In this example, the input has two objects of color 5 and one object of color 8. In the output, these objects change positions while maintaining their sizes. Specifically, the second object of color 5 moves to the beginning of the sequence, the third object of color 5 remains at its original position, and the single object of color 8 splits into three equal-sized objects placed after the first two objects.",
        "Example_2": "In this example, there are two objects of color 6 in the input, and one object of color 4 at the end. In the output, the two objects of color 6 merge into one large object, and the single object of color 4 duplicates itself twice to create an equally sized set of three objects."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern involves transforming each individual object in the input sequence according to specific rules depending on the object's color. The main rule appears to duplicate or split the object while preserving its size and changing its relative position in the sequence.",
    "instructions": [
        "Identify the objects in the input sequence.",
        "For each object, determine if it needs to be duplicated/split or merged/combined.",
        "If duplication/splitting is required, divide the object into multiple equal parts and adjust their positions accordingly.",
        "If merging/combinations is necessary, combine adjacent objects of the same color and update their positions.",
        "Create the final output sequence using the modified objects."
    ],
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
        "object_description": "There are four objects in the input sequence: two objects of color 7 (sizes 3), one object of color 3 (size 1), and one object of color 1 (size 1).",
        "transformed_objects": "After applying the transformation rules, we obtain the following objects: two objects of color 7 (sizes 3) remain unchanged; the object of color 3 becomes a group of three objects of the same color; the object of color 1 also duplicates itself twice.",
        "output": "[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
    },
    "test_output": np.array([0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

The test output sequence is returned in numpy array format as specified.
