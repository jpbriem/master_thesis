prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input has an object of color 6 starting at index 1 and ending at index 8. In the output, this object moves one position to the right, pushing the two background pixels at indices 7 and 8 out of the way.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input has an object of color 2 starting at index 0 and ending at index 2. In the output, this object stays in place but grows to the left, taking over three background pixels.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input has an object of color 6 starting at index 0 and ending at index 6. In the output, this object shrinks to the left by one position, creating a gap of three background pixels.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input-output pair, there is a single object present in both the input and output sequences. This object remains the same color but undergoes some change in size and/or position. Specifically, it either expands towards the left, contracts towards the left, or shifts one position to the right while maintaining its original size.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify the object in the input sequence (i.e., the contiguous block of non-zero pixels).
2. Determine whether the object should expand towards the left, contract towards the left, or shift one position to the right while maintaining its original size.
3. Apply the appropriate transformation to the object.
4. Fill any gaps left behind by the object\'s movement with background pixels (value 0).

Remember that the object will always remain the same color throughout the transformation process.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There is a single object of color 2 starting at index 5 and ending at index 7 (inclusive). It has a size of 3.', 'transformed_objects': 'After transformation, the object should still be of color 2 and have a size of 3. However, it should now start at index 4 and end at index 6 (inclusive), indicating that it shifted one position to the left.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0])}
