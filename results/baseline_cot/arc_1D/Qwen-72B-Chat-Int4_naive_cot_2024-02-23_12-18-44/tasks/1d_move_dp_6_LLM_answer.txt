prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, there is an object made up of color 2 located at indices 0 through 8 (inclusive). In the output, this object has moved one index to the right while maintaining its size. Additionally, noise pixels (value 0) were added at the beginning of the sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, there is an object made up of color 5 located at indices 7 through 11 (inclusive). In the output, this object has been scaled down to a single pixel at index 11 while keeping its original color. Additional noise pixels (value 0) were also added at the beginning of the sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, there is an object made up of color 8 located at indices 1 through 9 (inclusive). In the output, this object remains unchanged but additional noise pixels (value 0) were added at the beginning of the sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each example, a sequence of zeros is prepended to the input sequence. If the input contains multiple adjacent elements of the same value (an object), the object will either remain unchanged or shrink to a single element, depending on the specific example.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output:

1. Prepend a sequence of zeros to the input until it reaches a desired length (e.g., 16).
2. Identify any objects in the input sequence (i.e., consecutive elements of the same non-zero value).
3. Depending on the specific example, apply the appropriate transformation to each identified object:
   - Example_1: Move the object one index to the right.
   - Example_2: Shrink the object to a single element.
   - Example_3: Leave the object unchanged.
4. Ensure that the final output sequence matches the desired length.

Finally, create the resulting test output sequence according to these instructions.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]', 'object_description': 'There is an object made up of color 5 located at indices 0 through 10 (inclusive)', 'transformed_objects': 'The object should be shrunk to a single element at index 10, retaining its original color.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]' }, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]) }
