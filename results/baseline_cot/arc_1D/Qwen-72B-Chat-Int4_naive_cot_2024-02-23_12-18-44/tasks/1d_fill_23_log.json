            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, an object (color: 8) has been moved from index 7 to index 1 and scaled up in size.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, two separate objects (color: 2) at indices 1 and 5 have been merged into one large object starting at index 1.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, an object (color: 4) at index 3 has been copied and pasted three times, creating a larger object.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The pattern involves taking an existing object and either moving it to a new location while scaling it up in size, merging multiple smaller objects into a single larger object, or copying an object and repeating it to create a larger object.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output:\n\n1. Identify any objects present in the input sequence.\n2. Determine if there are any duplicate objects or adjacent objects of the same color.\n3. If there are duplicates or adjacents, merge them into a single object.\n4. Look for any gaps in the input sequence where an object could potentially fit.\n5. Choose one of the identified objects to modify according to the following patterns:\n   - Move the object to a new location and scale it up in size.\n   - Merge multiple smaller objects into a single larger object.\n   - Copy an object and repeat it to create a larger object.\n6. Apply the chosen modification to the selected object.\n7. Create the output sequence using the modified object(s).
