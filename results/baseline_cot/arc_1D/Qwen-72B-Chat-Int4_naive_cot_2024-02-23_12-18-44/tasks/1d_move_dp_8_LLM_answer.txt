prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 6]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has an object composed of four consecutive pixels of color 2 starting at index 1 and ending at index 4. In the output sequence, this object is moved two positions to the right, while keeping its original size.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has an object composed of three consecutive pixels of color 8 starting at index 2 and ending at index 4. In the output sequence, this object is scaled down to one pixel in size, located at index 5.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has an object composed of five consecutive pixels of color 8 starting at index 0 and ending at index 4. In the output sequence, this object remains unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve moving objects to the right, scaling them down, or leaving them unchanged depending on their initial position and size.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify any objects in the input sequence.
2. If there is an object consisting of multiple consecutive pixels of the same color starting at index 1, move it two positions to the right while preserving its size.
3. If there is an object consisting of multiple consecutive pixels of the same color starting at index 2 or higher, scale it down to a single pixel located at the next available index after any previously processed objects.
4. Leave any other objects (i.e., those starting at index 0) unchanged.

If no objects meet the criteria for movement or scaling, simply return the input sequence as the output.', 'transformation': {'input': '[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there is an object composed of five consecutive pixels of color 3 starting at index 0 and ending at index 4.', 'transformed_objects': 'In the test output sequence, the object composed of five consecutive pixels of color 3 should remain unchanged.', 'output': '[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]'}, 'test_output': np.array([3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6])}
