prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence has an object made up of seven consecutive 7s starting at index 5. In the output sequence, this object moves one position to the right and the leading zeros are added.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input sequence has an object made up of five consecutive 5s starting at index 2. In the output sequence, this object stays in place but four leading zeros are added.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input sequence has an object made up of twelve consecutive 6s starting at index 0. In the output sequence, two leading zeros are added and the rest of the object remains unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve adding leading zeros to the input sequence while keeping the positions of existing objects intact. The number of leading zeros added depends on the specific example.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify any existing objects in the input sequence.
2. Determine the appropriate number of leading zeros to add based on the example patterns (e.g., Example 1 adds six leading zeros, Example 2 adds four leading zeros).
3. Add the calculated number of leading zeros to the beginning of the input sequence.
4. Keep the positions of existing objects intact and preserve their sizes and colors.
5. Create the final output sequence using the modified input sequence.

Remember to consider edge cases where there may be no objects in the input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There is an object consisting of seven consecutive 1s starting at index 0.', 'transformed_objects': 'The object should remain in its original position and size but with additional leading zeros.', 'output': '[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0])}
