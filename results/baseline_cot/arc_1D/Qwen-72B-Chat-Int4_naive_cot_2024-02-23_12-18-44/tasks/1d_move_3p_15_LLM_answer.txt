prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence consists of four consecutive pixels of color 1 followed by six zeros. In the output sequence, these pixels are shifted two positions to the right while maintaining their order. Thus, the first two zeros become ones.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence contains eight consecutive pixels of color 8 followed by three zeros. Similarly, in the output sequence, these pixels are shifted two positions to the right while preserving their order. Therefore, the first two zeros become eights.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence has five consecutive pixels of color 5 followed by seven zeros. Unlike the previous examples, there's no shift in the output sequence; instead, it remains unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve shifting consecutive non-zero elements (objects) in the input sequence two positions to the right if they're surrounded by at least one zero element before and after them. However, if an object is already at the farthest right position, it doesn't change.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence (consecutive non-zero elements).
2. Check if each object is surrounded by at least one zero element both before and after it.
3. If so, shift the object two positions to the right.
4. Otherwise, keep the object in its original position.
5. Create the output sequence using the modified positions of the objects.', 'transformation': {'input': '[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There is one object of size 5, starting at index 0 and ending at index 4, with color 4.', 'transformed_objects': 'The object stays in its original position since it is already at the farthest right position.', 'output': '[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}
