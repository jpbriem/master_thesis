prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, two groups of adjacent pixels (objects) of color 4 exist in the input sequence separated by zeros. In the output sequence, each group has one zero inserted in the middle.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, there are three groups of adjacent pixels (objects) of color 8 in the input sequence separated by zeros. In the output sequence, the second object disappears and one zero is inserted at the beginning of the third object.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, there are two groups of adjacent pixels (objects) of color 8 in the input sequence separated by zeros. In the output sequence, the first object disappears and one zero is inserted before the second object.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve removing an object of a specific color (in this case, either 4 or 8) and inserting a single zero at a strategic location depending on whether it appears at the beginning or end of the original input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence using the inferred pattern, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.
2. Determine if any of those objects correspond to the target color (either 4 or 8).
3. If no target-color object exists, create an empty output sequence identical to the input sequence.
4. Otherwise, find the index where the target-color object begins.
5. Remove the entire target-color object from the input sequence.
6. Insert a zero at the index where the target-color object began in the original input sequence.
7. Append the modified input sequence after the inserted zero to form the final output sequence.

Remember to consider edge cases when implementing the algorithm.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there is a single object starting at index 2 with color 2 and ending at index 6, having a total size of 5.', 'transformed_objects': 'There will still be a single object in the output sequence but with the same properties - starting at index 2, ending at index 6, having a total size of 5, and color 2. A zero will be added at index 7.', 'output': '[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}
