prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence has multiple consecutive occurrences of the number 5. In the output sequence, these occurrences are moved to the right until they reach the last occurrence of 5 at index 20. All other positions remain unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input sequence contains an object made up of four consecutive occurrences of the number 1 starting at index 24. This object is copied and inserted after the last occurrence of 0 at index 36. All other positions remain unchanged.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input sequence contains an object made up of seven consecutive occurrences of the number 7 starting at index 23. This object is shifted one position to the left, causing the seventh occurrence of 7 to wrap around to the beginning of the sequence. Additionally, a single occurrence of 8 is added at the end of the sequence. All other positions remain unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The common pattern among these input-output pairs is that a specific object (made up of a certain color) in the input sequence is identified and subjected to some transformation. The type of transformation varies across examples, but it always involves modifying the position or quantity of the object while preserving the rest of the sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the object in the input sequence that undergoes transformation. This will typically involve finding a run of identical non-zero elements.
2. Determine what kind of transformation needs to be applied to the object based on the given examples. Possible transformations include moving, copying, scaling, removing, etc.
3. Apply the appropriate transformation to the identified object in the input sequence.
4. Leave all other elements in the input sequence unchanged.
5. Create the output sequence by combining the modified input sequence with any additional changes required by the specific transformation.', 'transformation': {'input': '[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0]', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there is an object composed of 21 consecutive occurrences of the number 4, starting at index 0.', 'transformed_objects': 'The transformed object should consist of two runs of 10 and 11 consecutive occurrences of the number 4, respectively, separated by a single occurrence of 0.', 'output': '[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0])}
