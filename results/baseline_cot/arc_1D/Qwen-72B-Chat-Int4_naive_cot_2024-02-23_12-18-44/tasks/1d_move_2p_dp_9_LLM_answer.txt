prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence contains two separate objects (one at indices 9-18 and one at index 21) and some noise pixels. In the output sequence, the object at indices 9-18 has been moved one position to the left, while the other object remains unchanged. Additionally, there is an extra noise pixel at index 21.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input sequence contains a single large object at indices 7-25 and some noise pixels. In the output sequence, the object remains unchanged but its left boundary has shifted rightwards by nine positions. There are also some additional noise pixels at indices 26-27.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input sequence contains two separate objects (one at indices 4-9 and another at index 12), along with some noise pixels. In the output sequence, both objects remain unchanged but their relative positions have swapped. Specifically, the second object now appears before the first object.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input-output pair, it seems that the objects in the input sequence are being rearranged according to a specific rule. One object is moved leftward while the other moves rightward, swapping places. However, the exact number of positions they shift varies across the examples. Additionally, some noise pixels may appear or disappear in the process.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its expected output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects present in the input sequence.
2. Determine the direction and amount of movement required for each object.
3. Shift the objects accordingly while maintaining their original sizes and shapes.
4. If necessary, add or remove noise pixels to match the desired output configuration.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence. Object 1 consists of ten consecutive pixels starting at index 5, with color 2. Object 2 is made up of a single pixel at index 20, with color 6.', 'transformed_objects': 'Both objects will maintain their original sizes and shapes, but their positions will change. Object 1 will move one position to the left, becoming located at indices 4-13 instead of 5-14. Object 2 will move six positions to the right, ending up at index 26 instead of 20.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6])}
