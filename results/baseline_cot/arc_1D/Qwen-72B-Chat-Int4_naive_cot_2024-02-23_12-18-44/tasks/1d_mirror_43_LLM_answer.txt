prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has an object of color 5 starting at index 3 and ending at index 8 (inclusive). In the output sequence, this object moves one position to the right and the number of noise pixels (value 0) before it increases by three.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence has an object of color 3 starting at index 2 and ending at index 7 (inclusive). In the output sequence, this object remains stationary but the number of noise pixels (value 0) after it increases by two.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence has an object of color 3 starting at index 3 and ending at index 7 (inclusive). In the output sequence, this object splits into two separate objects of the same color, each located at indices 6 and 8 respectively, while maintaining their original sizes. Additionally, the number of noise pixels (value 0) before the second object decreases by one.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern involves transforming the input sequence into the output sequence by moving or splitting objects and changing the positions of noise pixels.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify any objects in the input sequence.
2. If there are multiple objects, determine if they can be split into smaller objects without changing their total count.
3. Move or split the identified objects according to the patterns observed in the given examples.
4. Adjust the positions of noise pixels accordingly.

For example, in the given test case, we have an object of color 2 starting at index 1 and ending at index 4 (inclusive), along with additional noise pixels at other indices.

1. There's only one object in the input sequence.
2. No need to split the object since there's only one.
3. Move the object one position to the right and increase the number of noise pixels before it by three.
4. Update the remaining noise pixels accordingly.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There is one object of color 2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 4 (inclusive)', 'transformed_objects': 'After transformation, the object should be moved one position to the right, becoming [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}
