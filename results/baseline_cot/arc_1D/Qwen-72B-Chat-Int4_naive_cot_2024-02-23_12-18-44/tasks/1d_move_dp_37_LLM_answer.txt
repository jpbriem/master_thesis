prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the object starting at index 1 (color 3) has been moved two positions to the left.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, no changes were made to the objects.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the object starting at index 1 (color 1) has been moved three positions to the left.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The pattern seems to involve moving each non-zero element one position to the left if it exists in the original sequence. However, there are some exceptions where no change occurs. It could also depend on the specific colors involved.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the input sequence.
2. Check if the current element is equal to the next element in the sequence.
3. If they are equal, increment a counter variable.
4. After iterating through the entire sequence, iterate again through the input sequence.
5. If an element is non-zero and its position plus the counter variable is less than the length of the input sequence, replace the element at that position with zero.
6. Otherwise, leave the element unchanged.
7. Append any remaining non-zero elements to the end of the sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 ({color: 7, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 4}) and Object_2 ({color: 5, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 1}).', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the objects should appear as follows: Object_1 ({color: 7, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 4}) and Object_2 ({color: 5, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 1}).', 'output': '[7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0])}
