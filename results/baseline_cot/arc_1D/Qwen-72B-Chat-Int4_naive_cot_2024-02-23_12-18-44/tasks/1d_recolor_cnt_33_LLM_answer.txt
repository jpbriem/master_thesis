prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, each object of color 7 in the input has been replaced with an object one index lower (i.e., 6) and two additional objects of color 1 have been added at the beginning and end of the sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, each object of color 7 in the input has been replaced with an object one index higher (i.e., 8) and three additional objects of color 1 have been added at the beginning and end of the sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, each object of color 7 in the input has been replaced with an object one index lower (i.e., 6), except for one object that remains unchanged (i.e., color 7). Additionally, an object of color 8 has been inserted before the unchanged object.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to replace each object of color 7 in the input with an object one index lower (i.e., 6) if it is surrounded by other objects of color 7, or to replace it with an object one index higher (i.e., 8) otherwise. Additionally, objects of color 1 are inserted at the beginning and end of the sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

  1. Replace each object of color 7 in the input with an object one index lower (i.e., 6) if it is surrounded by other objects of color 7, or with an object one index higher (i.e., 8) otherwise.
  2. Insert objects of color 1 at the beginning and end of the sequence.

For example, given the input sequence `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, apply the above instructions to obtain the output sequence `[0, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are four objects in the input sequence: two objects of color 7 starting at indices 2 and 8, respectively; an object of color 0 starting at index 5; and an object of color 7 starting at index 15.', 'transformed_objects': 'The transformed objects will consist of two objects of color 6 starting at indices 2 and 8, respectively; an object of color 0 starting at index 5; and an object of color 8 starting at index 15. Additionally, there will be objects of color 1 starting at indices 0 and 22.', 'output': '[0, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]' }, 'test_output': np.array([0, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])}
