prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, all the zeros at the beginning and end of the input sequence remain unchanged in the output sequence. However, six additional zeros are inserted between the two groups of sixes.', 'Example_2': 'Similarly, in this example, all the zeros at the beginning and end of the input sequence remain unchanged in the output sequence. But, four additional zeros are inserted between the two groups of fours.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, there are no changes made to the zeros at the beginning and end of the input sequence. However, eight additional zeros are inserted before the group of sixes.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve inserting a number of zeros between the initial and final runs of non-zero elements in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence using the observed pattern:

1. Identify the first occurrence of a non-zero element (call it `start`).
2. Identify the last occurrence of a non-zero element (call it `end`).
3. Insert `end - start + 1` number of zeros between the indices `start` and `end+1`.
4. Leave any remaining elements (zeros) in their original positions.

For example, given `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we would follow these steps:

1. `start = 1`, `end = 5`
2. Insert `(5-1)+1=5` zeros between indices `1` and `6`: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
3. Resultant sequence: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`}, 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence: one object with color 7 starting at index 1 and ending at index 5, and several noise pixels represented by zeros.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation pattern, there will be five objects in the output sequence: two objects with color 7 starting at index 1 and ending at index 5, respectively, and several noise pixels represented by zeros.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}
