prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, there is no change in the number or order of objects. However, all instances of the object with color 3 are shifted four positions to the right.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, there is no change in the number or order of objects. However, two additional objects of color 0 are added at the beginning of the sequence, and one instance of the object with color 7 is removed from the end of the sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, there is no change in the number or order of objects. However, three instances of the object with color 3 are removed from the beginning of the sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each object in the input sequence, if it is not the first occurrence of that object in the sequence, then shift it to the right by a number of positions equal to the index of the previous occurrence of that object. If an object occurs multiple times consecutively, treat them as separate occurrences. Additionally, add or remove noise pixels (color 0) at the beginning or end of the sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output:',

  * Identify the unique colors present in the input sequence and their respective indices of first occurrence.
  * Iterate over each object in the input sequence starting from the second object.
    * Shift the current object to the right by a number of positions equal to the index of the previous occurrence of its color.
  * Check if the resulting sequence has any leading or trailing zeros that were not present in the original input sequence. Add or remove these zeros as necessary to match the desired output format.
  * Return the resulting sequence as the output.
