prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, an object composed of color 7 moves two positions to the right, pushing the object of color 2 one position to the left.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, an object composed of color 4 shrinks to half its original size while maintaining its center position. As a result, it no longer overlaps with the object of color 2.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, an object composed of color 4 grows to double its original size while preserving its center position. It pushes the object of color 2 outwards.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The transformation involves modifying the size of objects depending on their color. Color 7 moves to the right while maintaining its size, whereas color 4 changes size while keeping its center position. If growing, it pushes other objects outwards; if shrinking, it does not affect other objects.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on adjacent pixels of the same color.
2. Determine the target size of each object based on its color according to the given examples:
   - Color 7 remains unchanged.
   - Color 4 doubles (grows) or halves (shrinks) its size.
3. Adjust the position of the objects accordingly:
   - Color 7 shifts two positions to the right.
   - Color 4 maintains its center position but expands/shrinks around it.
4. Ensure there's enough space for the modified objects and adjust any affected objects appropriately.
5. Fill the remaining gaps with zeros.

Remember that this process affects only the non-zero elements (objects) in the sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence:
