prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence contains two groups of adjacent pixels of color 7. In the output sequence, these groups are replaced by smaller versions (with half the number of pixels) at the same positions. Additionally, their colors change to 2 and 3 respectively.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence has three distinct regions of color 7 separated by zeros. In the output sequence, each region is reduced in size by half, and its color changes to 3. There is also an extra zero added at the beginning of the sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, there are four groups of color 7 pixels in the input sequence, one group located before the first zero, another group after it, and two more groups surrounding the second zero. The output sequence reduces the sizes of those groups by half and assigns them new colors: 2, 3, 3, and 2 respectively.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to shrink each group of consecutive pixels of the same color (except 0), reduce their count by half, and assign them new colors. The new colors seem to incrementally increase from left to right.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify continuous segments of non-zero pixels in the input sequence.
2. Replace each segment with a smaller version containing half the number of pixels.
3. Assign new colors to the segments starting from 2 (for the leftmost segment), increasing by 1 for each subsequent segment.
4. Insert any necessary additional zeros to maintain the original structure of the input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence:
