prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, two objects are present in the input sequence - one at index 19 and another at index 26. In the output sequence, the object at index 19 remains unchanged while the object at index 26 has moved one position to the left.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, there are two objects present in the input sequence - one at index 4 and another at index 18. Both these objects remain unchanged in the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, there are two objects present in the input sequence - one at index 0 and another at index 12. In the output sequence, the object at index 0 has been shifted to indices 2 through 9 while the object at index 12 remains unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each pair of input-output sequences, it appears that an existing object (in the form of consecutive repeating numbers) is being modified or moved. Specifically, the object at a particular index seems to be copied over a range of positions starting from the next available position after any existing objects.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the observed pattern, follow these steps:

1. Identify all objects in the input sequence.
2. Iterate through each identified object.
3. Create a new object with the same properties as the original object (i.e., color and size).
4. Insert the new object immediately after the original object's last position.
5. If there is no space available after the original object's last position, insert the new object at the beginning of the sequence.
6. Remove the original object from the sequence.
7. Append any remaining noise pixels (zeros) at the end of the sequence.

After completing these steps, you will obtain the transformed output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence - one at index 5 with color 7 and size 7, another at index 17 with color 3 and size 1, and finally, a noise pixel (zero) at index 26.', 'transformed_objects': 'The transformed output sequence should contain two instances of the object at index 5, with the second instance inserted immediately after the first instance. The object at index 17 and the noise pixel at index 26 should remain unchanged.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}
