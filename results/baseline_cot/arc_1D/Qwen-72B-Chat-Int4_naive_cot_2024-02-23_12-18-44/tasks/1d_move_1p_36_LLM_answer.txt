prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, an object consisting of color 2 has been moved one position to the left.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, an object consisting of color 1 has been moved two positions to the right.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, an object consisting of color 5 has been scaled down by removing the first and last elements.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The pattern involves moving the first occurrence of each non-zero element in the input sequence towards the center of the sequence until it reaches the other side.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify the first occurrence of each non-zero element (objects) in the input sequence.
2. Determine the direction towards the center of the sequence where the object needs to be moved. If the current position of the object is less than half of the total sequence length, move it one position to the left; otherwise, move it one position to the right.
3. Remove any noise pixels (elements with value 0).
4. Apply the determined movement directions to the objects.
5. Create the output sequence using the modified objects and remaining noise pixels.

For example, given the input sequence [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], perform the following operations:

1. Identify the objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 0, end_index: 4, size: 5}]
2. Determine the movement direction: Move Object_1 one position to the left.
3. Remove noise pixels.
4. Apply the movement: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
5. Create the output sequence: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].', 'transformation': {'input': '[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there is one object consisting of color 2 at position 0 with a size of 5.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the object will still consist of color 2 but will be shifted one position to the left, starting at index 1 with a size of 5.', 'output': '[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}
