prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence has an object made up of nine consecutive pixels of color 2 and ten noise pixels at the end. In the output sequence, the object moves two positions towards the beginning while keeping its shape intact.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input sequence contains an object composed of five consecutive pixels of color 5 surrounded by eight noise pixels. In the output sequence, the object shifts three positions towards the beginning while preserving its shape.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input sequence consists of an object formed by nine contiguous pixels of color 8 and eleven noise pixels at the end. In the output sequence, the object slides one position towards the beginning without any changes in its structure.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The common pattern among these input-output pairs is that the object in each input sequence moves towards the beginning of the sequence by a specific number of positions. The number of positions the object shifts varies across examples but does not exceed the total count of noise pixels at the beginning of the input sequence. Additionally, the shape and color of the object remain unchanged during the transformation.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output:

1. Identify the object (consecutive pixels) and noise pixels in the input sequence.
2. Determine the number of positions the object needs to shift towards the beginning. This can be calculated as the minimum of the total number of noise pixels at the beginning of the input sequence minus one, and the sum of the starting index of the object subtracted from the ending index of the object.
3. Shift the object accordingly while maintaining its original shape and color.
4. Keep the remaining elements in their respective positions.
5. Combine the shifted object and the other elements to form the final output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There is an object consisting of twelve consecutive pixels of color 5 starting at index 1 and ending at index 12. There are also four noise pixels at the end of the sequence.', 'transformed_objects': 'The object remains unchanged except for its position, which moves towards the beginning of the sequence.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0])}
