prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence has an object of color 2 starting at index 11 and ending at index 14. In the output sequence, this object is moved two positions to the right.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input sequence has an object of color 5 spanning indices 4 through 18. In the output sequence, the leftmost three instances of this object are removed.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input sequence has an object of color 5 spanning indices 1 through 17. In the output sequence, the rightmost three instances of this object are added.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve removing or adding instances of objects depending on their position relative to the edge of the sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify any objects in the input sequence.
2. Determine if there are any instances of those objects near the edges of the sequence (e.g., within the first few or last few indices).
3. If there are instances near the edge, determine whether they should be removed or added according to the observed patterns in the previous examples.
4. Apply the necessary changes to create the output sequence.

For instance, if you observe an object near the beginning of the sequence and it is being removed in the examples, do the same for your input sequence. Similarly, if an object near the end of the sequence is being extended, add more instances of that object to the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]', 'object_description': 'There is one object in the input sequence, of color 4, starting at index 4 and ending at index 19.', 'transformed_objects': 'The transformed object should still have color 4 but should span indices 4 through 16 (excluding the previously existing instances at the ends).', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]' }, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]) }
