prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence contains an object of color 3 (size 5) and another object of color 9 (size 1). In the output sequence, these two objects remain unchanged, but they are shifted to the left by 2 positions. All other positions are filled with the background color 0.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input sequence contains an object of color 7 (size 9) and another object of color 9 (size 1). In the output sequence, the object of color 7 is reduced in size by 2 positions, while the object of color 9 remains unchanged. Additionally, there are 2 extra background color 0 positions at the beginning of the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input sequence contains an object of color 3 (size 5), followed by 2 background color 0 positions, and then another object of color 9 (size 1). In the output sequence, both objects remain unchanged, but the entire sequence is shifted to the right by 2 positions. There are no changes to any other positions.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve shifting objects horizontally and/or changing their sizes. Specifically, the first object is shifted to the left by 2 positions if it appears before the second object, otherwise it remains unchanged. If there are additional background color 0 positions between the objects, the entire sequence is shifted to the right by 2 positions. Also, the size of the first object may be reduced by 2 positions if it has enough space to do so without overlapping with the second object.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify the two objects in the input sequence, including their colors, starting indices, and sizes.
2. Determine whether the first object needs to be shifted to the left by 2 positions. This happens when the first object comes before the second object and there are no additional background color 0 positions between them.
3. If the first object can be safely reduced in size by 2 positions without overlapping with the second object, do so.
4. Shift the entire sequence to the right by 2 positions if there are additional background color 0 positions between the objects.
5. Create the resulting output sequence using the modified objects and the original background color 0 positions.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there are two objects present: one of color 1 (size 8) starting at index 1 and another of color 9 (size 1) starting at index 11.', 'transformed_objects': 'In the transformed output, the object of color 1 will be reduced in size by 2 positions to become size 6, and it will also be shifted to the left by 2 positions.
