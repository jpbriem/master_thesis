prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, two objects are present - one of color 4 at the beginning of the sequence and another of color 9 towards the end. In the output, the object of color 4 has been removed, and the positions of other elements remain unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, there is an object of color 7 located at the start of the sequence followed by some noise pixels (0) and then an object of color 9 towards the end. In the output, the object of color 7 gets shifted to the right side while preserving its shape and size, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, we have an object of color 2 placed near the start of the sequence surrounded by noise pixels. An object of color 9 appears later in the sequence. The output shows that the object of color 2 remains intact but shifts to the right after the object of color 9, while the remaining elements stay unmodified.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve shifting the first non-background object found in the input sequence to the right side of the output sequence while keeping its original shape and size. Other objects in the input sequence retain their identity in the output sequence, and noise pixels are preserved.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify the first non-background object in the input sequence.
2. Shift this object to the right side of the output sequence while maintaining its shape and size.
3. Keep all other objects in the input sequence as they are in the output sequence.
4. Preserve any noise pixels (background color 0).
