prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence has an object composed of six consecutive pixels of color 6 at positions 1 through 7, surrounded by background pixels (value 0). In the output sequence, the object moves two positions towards the left, effectively shifting it from indices 1 through 7 to indices -1 through 5.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input sequence contains an object composed of three consecutive pixels of color 2 at positions 1 through 3, followed by nine background pixels. The output sequence shifts the object one position to the right, moving it from indices 1 through 3 to indices 2 through 4.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input sequence consists of an object made up of six consecutive pixels of color 6 at positions 1 through 6, followed by six background pixels. The output sequence shifts the entire object four positions to the right, changing its position range from 1 through 6 to 5 through 10.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The input-output relationship involves shifting each object present in the input sequence to the right by a number of positions equal to half the width of the object.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output:

1. Identify all objects in the input sequence.
2. Determine the width of each identified object.
3. Shift each object to the right by half its width.
4. Ensure that shifted objects do not exceed the total sequence length. If they do, truncate them accordingly.
5. Combine the shifted objects with any remaining background pixels to create the final output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There is one object in the input sequence composed of three consecutive pixels of color 2 at positions 6 through 8, surrounded by background pixels.', 'transformed_objects': 'The object should shift one position to the right, becoming positioned at indices 7 through 9.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0])}
