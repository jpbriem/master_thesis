prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, two adjacent objects of color 2 were present in the input sequence at positions 1 to 2 and 5 to 6. In the output sequence, these two objects merged together forming one object starting from index 2 till index 5.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, three adjacent objects of color 8 were present in the input sequence at positions 2 to 4. In the output sequence, they remained unchanged.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, five adjacent objects of color 8 were present in the input sequence at positions 0 to 4. In the output sequence, an additional object of color 8 was added at the beginning.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Given an input sequence where each element can take integer values ranging from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and 0 denoting the background color, the output sequence is obtained by merging any two adjacent objects of the same color if there exists a run of zeros between them.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the input sequence.
2. Check if there exist any two adjacent objects of the same color separated by a run of zeros.
3. If so, merge those two objects together by shifting their combined indices towards the leftmost side until no more runs of zeros separate them.
4. Otherwise, keep the objects as they are.
5. Continue iterating until the entire input sequence has been processed.', 'transformation': {'input': [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'Regarding the given test input, it contains four adjacent objects of color 3:', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the required transformation, the objects will appear as follows:', 'output': [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0])}
