            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the object of color 7 at positions 2 and 5 has been duplicated to create three consecutive objects of the same color.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the object of color 6 at positions 4 and 7 has been duplicated to create three consecutive objects of the same color.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, two separate objects of color 7 (at positions 3-4 and 6-7) have been merged together to form one large object spanning positions 3-8.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The input-output pattern involves duplicating an existing object of a given color to create multiple consecutive instances of that object, or merging two separate objects of the same color into one larger object.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n1.
