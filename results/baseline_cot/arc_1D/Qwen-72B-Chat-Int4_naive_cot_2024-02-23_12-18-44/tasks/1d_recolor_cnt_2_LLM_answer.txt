prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, each occurrence of object 9 (with size >= 2) is replaced by a smaller version of itself. Specifically, it moves one index to the left and changes its size by subtracting 5.', 'Example_2': 'Similar to Example 1, here we also see the replacement of object 9 (with size >= 2). It moves two indices to the left and reduces its size by subtracting 6.', 'Example_3': 'Again, the same rule applies where every large instance of object 9 gets downscaled. In this particular case, it shifts three positions to the left and shrinks in size by subtracting 8.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For any consecutive sequence of at least two 9s, replace them with a smaller sequence of 9s shifted towards the beginning of the original sequence by an amount equal to half its original size, while reducing the size by subtracting half its original size rounded down.', 'instructions': 'First identify instances of object 9 with sizes greater than or equal to 2. Next, calculate the shift required by dividing the original size of the object by 2 (rounded down) and moving the object to the left accordingly. Finally, reduce the size of the object by subtracting half its original size rounded down.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are four instances of object 9 in the input sequence. One starts at index 2, another at index 4, followed by one more at index 8 and the last one at index 11.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation pattern, there will be two modified versions of object 9 remaining. They will start at index 1 and index 5 respectively, both having a size of 2.', 'output': '[0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0])}
