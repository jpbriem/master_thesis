prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence has three consecutive objects of color 1 surrounded by background (value 0). In the output sequence, these objects are moved two positions to the right while keeping their sizes intact.', 'Example_2': 'Here, the input sequence contains an object of color 5 spanning across seven positions and flanked by background. The output sequence retains this object but shifts it one position to the left.', 'Example_3': 'For this instance, the input sequence comprises a single large object of color 4 extending over eight positions and bordered by background. In the output sequence, this object remains unchanged except for being shifted four positions to the right.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The common pattern among these examples is that the objects in the input sequence get moved horizontally towards the right-hand side in the output sequence without any change in size. The number of positions they shift depends on the total number of zeros before them in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.
2. Determine the count of leading zeros in the input sequence.
3. Shift each identified object by a number of positions equal to the count of leading zeros.
4. Retain the relative order and sizes of the objects in the output sequence.
5. Fill the remaining positions in the output sequence with zeros.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 (color: 6, start_index: 2, end_index: 7, size: 6) and Object_2 (color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 12, size: 5)', 'transformed_objects': 'In the output sequence, Object_1 will remain at the same position and size (start_index: 2, end_index: 7), whereas Object_2 will be shifted six positions to the right (start_index: 8, end_index: 13).
