prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, two adjacent objects of color 2 are present in the input sequence. In the output sequence, these objects are moved one position towards the left while preserving their sizes.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, there are two adjacent objects of color 6 in the input sequence. These objects remain unchanged in terms of color but are moved three positions towards the right in the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, an object of color 6 is present at the beginning of the input sequence. This object remains unchanged in terms of color but is shifted five positions towards the right in the output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern involves shifting objects in the input sequence towards the right by a fixed number of positions while preserving their sizes and colors.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using the observed pattern, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects (consecutive occurrences of the same non-zero value) in the input sequence.
2. Shift each identified object towards the right by four positions while maintaining its original size and color.
3. Replace any remaining noise pixels (non-zero values outside the shifted objects) with zeros.
4. Add two additional zeros at the end of the sequence if they were originally present before the first object.', 'transformation': {'input': '[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There is one large object of color 3 starting at index 0 and ending at index 8. There is also some noise in the form of two consecutive zeros after the object.', 'transformed_objects': 'The object of color 3 should be shifted four positions to the right, resulting in it being located at indices 4 to 11. The noise pixels should be replaced with zeros.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0])}
