prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, an object composed of three consecutive 4s is present at the end of the input sequence. In the output sequence, this object has been extended by repeating it seven times.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, there is an object made up of five consecutive 5s in the middle of the input sequence. In the output sequence, this object has been extended by repeating it eight times.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, an object consisting of nine consecutive 7s appears towards the beginning of the input sequence. In the output sequence, this object has been extended by repeating it ten times.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that each object in the input sequence (except for noise pixels) is repeated a number of times equal to one more than its original size. The repetition starts immediately after the last occurrence of the object in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To perform the transformation, identify all objects in the input sequence (excluding noise pixels). For each object, determine its size and repeat it once more than its original size starting from the next available position in the output sequence. Finally, fill any remaining positions in the output sequence with zeros.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], 'object_description': [{'size': 7, 'position': 6, 'color': 7}, {'size': 1, 'position': 22, 'color': 8}], 'transformed_objects': [{'size': 8, 'position': 6, 'color': 7}, {'size': 2, 'position': 22, 'color': 8}], 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0])}
