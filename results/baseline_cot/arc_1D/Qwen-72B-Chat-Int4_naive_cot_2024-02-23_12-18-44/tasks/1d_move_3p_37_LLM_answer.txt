prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the object composed of color 3 has moved one position to the right.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the object composed of color 6 has also moved one position to the right.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the object composed of color 1 has moved four positions to the right.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The input-output relationship is that each object moves one position to the right while maintaining its shape.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.
2. Move each object one position to the right while preserving its shape.
3. Ensure that any leading zeros remain at the beginning of the sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There is an object composed of color 7 starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.', 'transformed_objects': 'After moving the object one position to the right, it starts at index 1 and ends at index 4.', 'output': [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0])}
