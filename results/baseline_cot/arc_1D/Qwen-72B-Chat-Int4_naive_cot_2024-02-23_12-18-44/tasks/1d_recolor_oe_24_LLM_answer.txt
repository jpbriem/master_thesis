prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, each group of consecutive ones (objects) in the input sequence has been replaced with the number six (6), indicating a change in value.', 'Example_2': 'Similar to Example 1, every group of consecutive ones (objects) in the input sequence is replaced with the number six (6). Additionally, there is no change in object positions.', 'Example_3': 'As before, groups of consecutive ones (objects) in the input sequence have been replaced with a new value, seven (7) in this case. Furthermore, two separate objects remain at their original positions but have had their values modified.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern observed across these examples involves replacing any group of consecutive ones (objects) in the input sequence with a new integer value, either six (6) or seven (7), depending on the specific example. There is no movement or modification of object positions.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its expected output:

1. Identify all groups of consecutive ones (objects).
2. Replace each identified group of ones with the appropriate replacement value, either six (6) or seven (7), according to the specific example being followed.
3. Maintain the same order and positioning of objects in the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence. The first object starts at index 3 and ends at index 5, containing one element. The second object starts at index 6 and ends at index 8, containing three elements. The third object starts at index 10 and ends at index 10, containing one element.', 'transformed_objects': 'In the transformed output sequence, the first object remains unchanged, while the second object will be replaced with the value six (6), and the third object will also be replaced with the value six (6).
