prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, all occurrences of object 2 are removed.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, no changes are made to the input sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, all occurrences of object 3 are moved one position to the right.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve removing or moving specific objects depending on their type.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify any objects that need to be removed or moved according to the pattern observed in the given examples (e.g., if an object appears multiple times, check if it needs to be entirely removed or shifted).
2. Remove the identified objects from the input sequence.
3. If necessary, shift other objects accordingly to maintain the correct order.
4. Create the final output sequence using the modified input sequence.

For example, in the provided test case, we would identify that object 6 at index 20 needs to be moved one position to the left. We then remove it from the input sequence and shift all subsequent elements one position to the left. Finally, we create the output sequence using the updated input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence: Object_1 (color: 5, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 3), Object_2 (color: 4, start_index: 9, end_index: 10, size: 1), and Object_3 (color: 9, start_index: 11, end_index: 11, size: 1).', 'transformed_objects': 'Object_1 remains unchanged.
