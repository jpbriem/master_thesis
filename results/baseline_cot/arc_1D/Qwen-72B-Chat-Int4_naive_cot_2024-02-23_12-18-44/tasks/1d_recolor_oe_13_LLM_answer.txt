prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In this example, each occurrence of the number 6 in the input sequence has been replaced by the number 9 in the output sequence. Additionally, every fourth occurrence of the number 6 (counting from the left) has been reduced to half its original size.",
        "Example_2": "Similar to Example 1, each occurrence of the number 6 in the input sequence has been replaced by the number 4 in the output sequence. However, in this case, every third occurrence of the number 6 (counting from the left) has had two additional instances appended to it."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "For both examples, there's a replacement rule where every occurrence of the number 6 in the input is replaced by another number in the output (e.g., 9 or 4). Furthermore, there's an exception to this general rule - some occurrences of the number 6 are modified differently based on their positions relative to other numbers in the input sequence.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify all occurrences of the number 6 in the input sequence.
2. Replace each occurrence of the number 6 with another predetermined number (e.g., 9 or 4).
3. Modify specific occurrences of the number 6 according to their positions in the input sequence.

For example, if we want to replace 6s with 9s, modify every fourth occurrence starting from the left by reducing it to half its original size. If we're replacing 6s with 4s, append two more instances of the number 4 to every third occurrence of the number 6 counting from the left.",
