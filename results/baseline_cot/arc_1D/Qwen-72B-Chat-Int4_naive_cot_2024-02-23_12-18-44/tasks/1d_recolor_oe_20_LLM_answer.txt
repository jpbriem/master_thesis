prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, each group of consecutive 9s in the input has been replaced with a smaller number (either 3 or 6) in the output. The number used depends on whether the group of 9s is odd-numbered or even-numbered when counting from the left.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, each group of consecutive 9s in the input has also been replaced with a smaller number (either 3 or 6). However, unlike Example 1, the number used does not depend on the location of the group but rather on the parity of the count of 9s in the group. If there are an even number of 9s, they are replaced with 3; if there are an odd number, they are replaced with 6.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, each group of consecutive 9s in the input has been replaced with either 3 or 6 depending on whether the group is separated from another group of 9s by at least one non-9 value. Specifically, groups of 9s separated by at least one non-9 value are replaced with 6, while those that are adjacent to other groups of 9s are replaced with 3.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve replacing each group of consecutive 9s in the input with some smaller number. This replacement may depend on factors such as the location of the group, the count of 9s in the group, or the presence of other groups nearby.', 'instructions': 'To apply this transformation to a new input, follow these steps:

  1. Identify all groups of consecutive 9s in the input.
  2. Determine which rule applies to each group based on its location, count, or adjacency to other groups.
  3. Replace each group with the appropriate smaller number according to the applicable rule.'}, 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence: two of them have the color 9 and are located at positions 1 through 5 and 8 through 17, respectively; the third object has the color 0 and is located at positions 6, 7, 18, 19, and 20.', 'transformed_objects': 'The transformed objects will still have the colors 9 and 0, but their sizes and locations may change depending on the applied rule.', 'output': '[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]'}, 'test_output': array([0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9,
       9, 9])}
