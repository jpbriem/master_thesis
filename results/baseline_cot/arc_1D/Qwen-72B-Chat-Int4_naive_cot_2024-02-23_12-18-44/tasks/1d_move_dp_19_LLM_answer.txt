prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, the input sequence has three consecutive objects of color 1 (at indices 3-5), surrounded by background color 0. In the output sequence, these three objects are reduced to two objects of color 1.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the input sequence consists of an object of color 5 (at indices 1-8) and another object of color 3 at index 11. The output sequence maintains both objects but adds four additional elements of color 5 before the existing ones.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, the input sequence contains one large object of color 4 (at indices 0-7) and another object of color 3 at index 11. In the output sequence, the original object of color 4 is split into five smaller objects of the same color, while maintaining the object of color 3.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The common pattern among the given input-output pairs is that the number of objects of each color increases by one in the output compared to the input. However, the total number of non-background elements remains constant across inputs and outputs. Additionally, there may be changes in the positioning of some objects.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its expected output, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their unique colors (excluding background color 0).
2. Add an extra element of the same color to each identified object.
3. If adding the extra element causes the object to exceed the maximum allowed size (i.e., seven consecutive elements), split it into multiple smaller objects of the same color.
4. Rearrange the objects if necessary to maintain the overall structure of the input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 (color 6, positions 2-5) and Object_2 (color 3, position 11).', 'transformed_objects': 'In the transformed output, Object_1 will consist of six elements of color 6 (positions 2-7), and Object_2 will remain unchanged.', 'output': '[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]'}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0])}
