prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, two objects (colored 2) were present in the input sequence at indices 5 through 9 and one object (colored 9) was present at index 10. In the output sequence, these objects were rearranged: the single object (colored 9) moved to index 1, while the two objects (colored 2) remained in their original positions but shifted right by one index.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, there were four objects in the input sequence: an empty space at index 0, an object colored 4 at indices 5 through 9, another empty space at index 10, and finally an object colored 9 at index 11. In the output sequence, the objects were rearranged: the single object (colored 9) moved to index 0, while the object colored 4 remained in its original positions but shifted left by three indexes. An additional empty space was added at the end of the sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, there were five objects in the input sequence: four empty spaces at indices 0 through 3, a single object colored 1 at indices 4 through 8, and then seven more empty spaces at indices 9 through 15. In the output sequence, the objects were rearranged: the single object (colored 1) moved to index 10, while the eight empty spaces remained in their original positions but shifted left by nine indexes.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern across all input-output pairs involves moving a single object (always colored 9) to the beginning of the sequence and shifting other objects accordingly. Specifically, if there are n non-empty spaces before the object colored 9 in the input sequence, it moves to index n in the output sequence. Additionally, if there are m objects of some other color after the object colored 9 in the input sequence, they shift right by m+1 indexes. Finally, an extra empty space is inserted at the end of the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence according to the observed pattern, follow these steps:

1. Identify the location of the object colored 9 in the input sequence.
2. Shift all objects occurring after the object colored 9 to the right by one more than the number of objects immediately following the object colored 9.
3. Move the object colored 9 to the front of the sequence, replacing any existing element at index 0.
4. Add an empty space at the end of the sequence.

If you encounter any issues during this process, double-check that the input and output sequences adhere to the specified constraints and properties.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are six objects in the input sequence: four empty spaces at indices 0 through 3, an object colored 6 at indices 4 through 8, and then five more empty spaces at indices 9 through 13. There is also an object colored 9 located at index 14.', 'transformed_objects': 'The object description remains unchanged except for the positions of the object colored 9 and the object colored 6:', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}
