prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, every occurrence of the number 7 in the input sequence has been replaced by 9 in the output sequence. Additionally, every pair of consecutive 7s in the input sequence has been replaced by three consecutive 4s in the output sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, every occurrence of the number 7 in the input sequence has been replaced by 9 in the output sequence. Additionally, every group of three consecutive 7s in the input sequence has been replaced by four consecutive 4s in the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, every occurrence of the number 7 in the input sequence has been replaced by 5 in the output sequence. Additionally, every group of three consecutive 7s in the input sequence has been replaced by four consecutive 4s in the output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input sequence, every occurrence of the number 7 is replaced by another number (either 9, 5 or 4 depending on the example) in the output sequence. Furthermore, groups of consecutive 7s in the input sequence are replaced by groups of consecutive numbers in the output sequence, with the length of these groups differing across examples.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence according to this pattern, follow these steps:

1. Replace every occurrence of the number 7 in the input sequence with another number, depending on the example being considered (e.g., replace it with 9 in Example 1).
2. Identify groups of consecutive 7s in the input sequence.
3. Depending on the example, replace each identified group with a different group of consecutive numbers. In Example 1, replace each pair of consecutive 7s with three consecutive 4s; in Example 2, replace each group of three consecutive 7s with four consecutive 4s; in Example 3, replace each group of three consecutive 7s with four consecutive 4s.
4. Leave all other elements in the input sequence unchanged.

By applying these steps, you can generate the appropriate output sequence for any given input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are six objects in the input sequence: two single-color objects of color 7 at positions 2 and 6, one multi-color object consisting of colors 0 and 7 starting at position 8 and ending at position 14, one single-color object of color 7 at position 16, one multi-color object consisting of colors 0 and 7 starting at position 18 and ending at position 22, and one single-color object of color 7 at position 24.', 'transformed_objects': 'The transformed objects will depend on the specific example being applied. However, we can generally expect some or all of the objects containing the number 7 to change their color and/or size.', 'output': '[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]' }, 'test_output': np.array([0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0])}
