prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has two objects - a single 5-pixel long object of color 8, followed by a 4-pixel long object of color 8. The output sequence has the same objects, but the order is swapped, and the second object is shifted by one pixel to the right.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has three objects - a single 1-pixel long object of color 1, followed by a 4-pixel long object of color 8, followed by another 4-pixel long object of color 8. The output sequence has the same objects, but the second object is shifted by one pixel to the left, and the third object is shifted by one pixel to the right.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has two objects - a 5-pixel long object of color 5, followed by a 4-pixel long object of color 4. The output sequence has the same objects, but the second object is shifted by one pixel to the left."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve moving, resizing, and recoloring objects, as well as changing their positions relative to each other. The specific operations seem to depend on the colors and sizes of the objects, as well as their positions in the sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, the following steps can be taken:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their colors and sizes.
2. Determine the desired positions and sizes of the objects in the output sequence.
3. Apply transformations to the objects, such as moving, scaling, and recoloring, to achieve the desired outcome.
4. Concatenate the transformed objects into a single output sequence.

Note that the specific instructions may vary depending on the particular input-output pair being considered.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has four objects - a 4-pixel long object of color 4, followed by a 2-pixel long object of color 2, followed by another 4-pixel long object of color 4, and finally a 4-pixel long object of color 4. The objects are arranged in a specific order, with some overlap between them.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have the same objects, but with different positions and sizes. Specifically, the first object should be moved one pixel to the right, the second object should be shrunk to 1 pixel in length and moved one pixel to the left, the third object should be expanded to 6 pixels in length and moved two pixels to the right, and the fourth object should be moved one pixel to the left.",
