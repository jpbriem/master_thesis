prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects: two red objects (colors 8 and 3) and one blue object (color 2). The red objects are moved to the beginning and end of the sequence, respectively, and their sizes are swapped. The blue object remains unchanged.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects: three red objects (colors 8, 3, and 2) and one blue object (color 7). The red objects are moved to the beginning, middle, and end of the sequence, respectively. The blue object is split into two parts, with the first part being moved to the middle of the sequence and the second part remaining at the end.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has five objects: four red objects (colors 8, 3, 2, and 7) and one blue object (color 5). The red objects are moved to the beginning, middle, and end of the sequence, respectively. The blue object is split into two parts, with the first part being moved to the middle of the sequence and the second part remaining at the end."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to follow a pattern of moving and resizing objects, as well as changing their colors. The pattern also involves splitting blue objects into two parts and moving them to different positions in the output sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, the following steps can be taken:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their colors.
2. Move the objects to their desired positions in the output sequence.
3. Resize the objects to their desired sizes.
4. Change the colors of the objects if necessary.
5. Split blue objects into two parts and move them to their desired positions in the output sequence.",

"object_description": "The input sequence has five objects: four red objects (colors 8, 3, 2, and 7) and one blue object (color 5). The red objects are located at the beginning, middle, and end of the sequence, respectively. The blue object is located in the middle of the sequence.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have the same objects as the input sequence, but with different positions and sizes. The red objects should be moved to the beginning, middle, and end of the sequence, respectively.
