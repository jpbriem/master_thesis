prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0]



Test case:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects: two red objects (colors 3) and one blue object (color 5). The red objects are moved to the beginning of the sequence, and the blue object is unchanged. The output sequence has the same objects as the input sequence, but with different positions.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has three objects: two green objects (color 2) and one red object (color 5). The green objects are removed, and the red object is moved to the beginning of the sequence. The output sequence has one red object (color 5) at the beginning, followed by a single green object (color 2).",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has four objects: three yellow objects (color 1) and one purple object (color 5). The yellow objects are merged into a single object, and the purple object is moved to the end of the sequence. The output sequence has a single yellow object (color 1) followed by a single purple object (color 5).",
"Test_Input": "The input sequence has eight objects: seven black objects (color 8) and one white object (color 0). The black objects are evenly distributed throughout the sequence, while the white object is located at the end. The output sequence should have the same objects as the input sequence, but with different positions."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship involves transforming objects in the input sequence based on their properties, such as color, size, and position. The transformation can include moving, removing, copying, scaling, and recoloring objects. The output sequence reflects the transformed objects' properties and positions.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their colors.
2. Determine the desired position, size, and color of each object in the output sequence.
3. Apply the necessary transformations to the objects in the input sequence to achieve the desired output.
4. Concatenate the transformed objects into a single output sequence.

Note: The specific instructions for each input-output pair may vary depending on the transformation required.",
