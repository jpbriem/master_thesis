prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 2, which are shifted one position to the right in the output sequence, leaving a single zero-valued pixel between them. The object of color 3 remains unchanged.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects of color 4, which are replaced by zeros in the output sequence, maintaining their original positions. A single object of color 3 is appended at the end of the sequence.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has five objects of color 8, which are reduced to four objects in the output sequence, keeping their original positions. Three zeros are inserted between the objects.",
"Test Case": "The input sequence has six objects of color 6, which are transformed into five objects of color 6 in the output sequence, shifting one position to the left."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship exhibits a sliding window approach, where objects are moved, resized, and removed while preserving their original order. Noise pixels are introduced and removed accordingly.",
"instructions": "To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence by their color values.
2. Determine the position, size, and color of each object.
3. Apply transformations to objects based on their properties, such as moving, hollowing, scaling, removing, copying, and recoloring.
4. Insert or remove noise pixels as needed.
5. Update the output sequence by applying the transformations and inserting/removing pixels accordingly.",
"transformation": {
"input": [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence contains six objects of color 6, with positions ranging from 0 to 5 and sizes varying between 1 and 6 pixels.",
"transformed_objects": "The objects in the output sequence should have the same positions and sizes as in the input sequence, but with updated colors and potential changes in shape due to applied transformations.",
"output": [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
"test_output": np.array([6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0])
