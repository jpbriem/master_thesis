prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 4, starting at index 4 and ending at index 11. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 6 at the end, starting at index 12 and ending at index 13.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects, one of color 7 starting at index 8 and ending at index 14, and another of color 7 starting at index 15 and ending at index 21. The output sequence is similar, but with the second object shifted by one index to the right, so it starts at index 16 and ends at index 22."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve applying a series of transformations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and adding noise to the objects. The exact nature of these transformations is not yet clear, but they seem to be deterministic and dependent on the properties of the objects themselves.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output, we need to apply a series of steps, which may include:

1. Identifying the objects in the input sequence and their properties (such as color, size, position).
2. Applying transformations to the objects, such as moving them, resizing them, or adding noise to them.
3. Reordering the objects in the sequence, if necessary.
4. Returning the resulting output sequence.

The specific instructions for each input-output pair will depend on the particular transformation being applied, but the general approach should be similar across all pairs.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has three objects: two objects of color 2, starting at indices 4 and 10, respectively, and one object of color 6 starting at index 12. The objects are all of size 2, except for the third object, which is of size 1.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have the same three objects, but with some modifications:

* The first object should be moved to start at index 5 and end at index 11.
* The second object should be moved to start at index 11 and end at index 17.
* The third object should be added to the end of the sequence, starting at index 18 and ending at index 19.

All objects should maintain their original color and size.",
"output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
}
```

Note that the instruction field provides a high-level description of the transformation process, while the transformation field provides a more detailed description of the specific transformation being applied to the input sequence. The output field contains the resulting output sequence, which can be used to verify the correctness of the transformation.
