prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

<</SYS>>
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, with sizes 3, 3, and 3, and positions 1, 4, and 7. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 3 at position 6, increasing the size of the third object from 3 to 6.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects of color 3, with sizes 3, 3, 3, and 3, and positions 1, 4, 7, and 10. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 3 at position 8, increasing the size of the fourth object from 3 to 6.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has five objects of color 4, with sizes 4, 4, 4, 4, and 4, and positions 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 4 at position 16, increasing the size of the fifth object from 4 to 8."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve copying the input sequence and adding one or more objects of the same color as the existing objects, with updated positions and sizes. The added objects seem to be placed after the last object of the corresponding color in the input sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Copy the input sequence.
2. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their color and position.
3. Determine the largest object of each color in the input sequence.
4. Add a new object of the same color as the largest object, with a position after the last object of the corresponding color.
5. Update the size of the new object to match the size of the largest object.
6. Return the transformed output sequence.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, with sizes 3, 3, and 3, and positions 1, 4, and 7.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have four objects of color 3, with sizes 3, 3, 3, and 6, and positions 1, 4, 7, and 10.",
"output": [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0],
"test_output": np.array([0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0])
}
```
Note that this is just one possible way to represent the input-output relationship and the transformation pattern. The actual format and content may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the task.
