prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

<</SYS>>
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, with the first two objects being adjacent to each other. The output sequence is similar, but with the middle object having been moved to the right, leaving a gap of size 2 between the first two objects.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has five objects of color 5, with four of them being adjacent to each other. The output sequence is similar, but with the fourth object having been removed, leaving a gap of size 1 between the second and fifth objects.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has four objects of color 3, with three of them being adjacent to each other. The output sequence is similar, but with the third object having been removed, leaving a gap of size 1 between the first and fourth objects."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve moving, removing, or copying objects while maintaining their original size and color. The transformations seem to be applied in a specific order, with some transformations affecting the positions of objects, while others change the number of objects.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their color and position.
2. Apply any necessary transformations to the objects, such as moving, removing, or copying them. Ensure that the size and color of each object remain unchanged.
3. Reorder the objects in the output sequence if necessary, maintaining the correct positional relationships between them.
4. Return the resulting output sequence, ensuring it has the same length as the input sequence.",
"transformation": {
"input": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence contains four objects of color 1, with each object being adjacent to the next. The objects are located at indices 1, 2, 4, and 6, respectively.",
"transformed_objects": "After applying the transformation, the objects should remain unchanged in terms of size and color, but their positions should be adjusted. Specifically, the second and third objects should be swapped, and the sixth object should be moved to the seventh position. The resulting output sequence should have the same four objects of color 1, but with a different ordering.",
"output": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"test_output": np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
}

Please note that this is just an initial guess based on the provided examples, and further refinement may be needed to fully capture the underlying pattern.
