prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 4, which is moved to the right and expanded to cover the entire output sequence. The output sequence has a single object of color 8, which is the result of the transformation.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects of colors 1 and 3, respectively. The objects are swapped and the resulting output sequence has a single object of color 3, followed by a single object of color 1.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects of colors 5, 6, and 5, respectively. The objects are rearranged and the resulting output sequence has a single object of color 5, followed by a single object of color 6, followed by a single object of color 5."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to be a sequence of transformations, where each transformation modifies the objects in the input sequence in some way, such as moving, resizing, or recoloring them. The output sequence is the result of applying these transformations to the input sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply a series of transformations to the objects in the input sequence. These transformations may include moving, resizing, recoloring, or removing objects. The specific transformations required will depend on the specific input sequence and the desired output sequence.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has four objects: a red object (color 6), a green object (color 2), a blue object (color 2), and a yellow object (color 2). The red object is located at the beginning of the sequence, followed by the green object, then the blue object, and finally the yellow object. All objects are of size 2, except for the red object, which is of size 6.",
"transformed_objects": "The objects in the output sequence should be modified as follows:

* The red object should be moved to the end of the sequence and reduced in size to 2.
* The green object should be moved to the second position and remain unchanged in size.
* The blue object should be moved to the third position and remain unchanged in size.
* The yellow object should be moved to the fourth position and remain unchanged in size.",
"output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
