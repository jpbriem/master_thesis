prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, which are shifted one position to the right in the output sequence, leaving a single object of color 3 at the beginning. There are also four zero-valued pixels at the end of both sequences.",
"Example_2": "All objects of color 2 in the input sequence are duplicated in the output sequence, resulting in twice the number of objects. The order of the objects remains the same.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence contains a single object of color 1, which is preserved in the output sequence. The remaining pixels are set to zero.",
"Overall Pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve applying operations to objects in the input sequence, such as shifting, duplicating, or preserving them. The output sequence seems to contain the same number of objects as the input sequence, but with potentially different positions and sizes.",
"Instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their color values.
2. Apply the appropriate operation to each object, such as shifting, duplicating, or preserving it.
3. Set any remaining pixels to zero.
4. Return the resulting output sequence."
"Transformation": {
"Input": [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0],
"Object Description": "The input sequence contains four objects of color 8, located consecutively. There are also four zero-valued pixels at the end of the sequence.",
"Transformed Objects": "Apply the operation of shifting the objects one position to the right. This will result in a single object of color 8 at the beginning of the sequence, followed by three objects of color 8 shifted one position to the right from their original positions.",
"Output": [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0],
"Test Output": np.array([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0])
}

Note: The description field provides a summary of the observed patterns and the instructions field outlines the steps required to transform the input sequence into its output sequence. The transformation field focuses on the specific input sequence provided and describes the identified objects, their positions, sizes, and colors. It also includes the resulting output sequence.
