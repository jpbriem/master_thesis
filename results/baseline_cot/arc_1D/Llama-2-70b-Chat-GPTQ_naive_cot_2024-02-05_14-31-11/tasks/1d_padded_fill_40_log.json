The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

There are three objects in the sequence - two objects with value 0 (background color) and one object with value 8 (foreground color). The first object has a size of 5 pixels, starting from the second pixel (index 1), and ending at the sixth pixel (index 5). The second object has a size of 4 pixels, starting from the seventh pixel (index 7), and ending at the tenth pixel (index 10). The third object has a size of 3 pixels, starting from the eleventh pixel (index 11), and ending at the thirteenth pixel (index 13).\n\nThe output sequence should have the same number of pixels as the input sequence, with the same values for each pixel. However, the order of the pixels may change, depending on the specific transformation applied.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\nThe input-output pairs exhibit a pattern where the output sequence is derived from the input sequence by applying a series of transformations. These transformations include moving, scaling, and copying objects, as well as modifying their colors. The exact nature of the transformations varies across input-output pairs, but they generally involve manipulating the position, size, and color of the objects present in the input sequence.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform the test input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.\n2. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color. In this case, there are three objects - two objects with value 0 (background color) and one object with value 8 (foreground color).\n3. Apply the necessary transformations to each object, taking into account its original position, size, and color. For instance, if an object needs to be moved, scaled, or copied, adjust its position, size, and color accordingly.\n4. Add the transformed objects to the output sequence, maintaining their updated positions and sizes.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all objects in the input sequence have been processed.\n6. Return the completed output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nObject Description:\n\n1. Object 1: Color - 0 (background), Start Index - 1, End Index - 5, Size - 5\n2. Object 2: Color - 0 (background), Start Index - 7, End Index - 10, Size - 4\n3. Object 3: Color - 8 (foreground), Start Index - 11, End Index - 13, Size - 3\n\nTransformed Objects:\n\n1. Object 1: Color - 0 (background), Start Index - 1, End Index - 5, Size - 5 (unchanged)\n2. Object 2: Color - 0 (background), Start Index - 7, End Index - 10, Size - 4 (unchanged)\n3. Object 3: Color - 8 (foreground), Start Index - 11, End Index - 13, Size - 3 (unchanged)\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nNote that the output sequence is identical to the input sequence since no modifications were made to the objects' positions, sizes, or colors."
