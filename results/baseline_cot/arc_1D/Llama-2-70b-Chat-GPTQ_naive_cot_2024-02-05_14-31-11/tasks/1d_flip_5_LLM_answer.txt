prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 4, which is moved to the right and scaled up to cover the entire output sequence. The output sequence has a single object of color 3, which is the result of the transformation.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects of colors 1 and 2. The objects are swapped and the resulting output sequence has two objects of colors 1 and 2 in a different order.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has a single object of color 4, which is scaled down to fit inside a smaller object of color 3. The output sequence has a single object of color 3, which contains a smaller object of color 4.",
"Test_case": "The input sequence has a single object of color 7, which is transformed into a sequence of three objects of colors 2, 2, and 2. The output sequence has three objects of colors 2, 2, and 2, with the middle object being slightly larger than the other two."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve transformations such as moving, scaling, and swapping objects, as well as changing their colors. The patterns also suggest that objects can be combined or split apart, and that the output sequence may contain more or fewer objects than the input sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their positions, sizes, and colors.
2. Apply transformations to the objects, such as moving, scaling, or swapping them, based on the input-output relationships observed in the examples.
3. Combine or split apart objects as necessary to create the desired output sequence.
4. Return the resulting output sequence, minding the sequence length!",

"object_description": "The input sequence has a single object of color 7, which spans the entire sequence. There are no noise pixels.",
"transformed_objects": "The object of color 7 should be transformed into three objects of colors 2, 2, and 2, with the middle object being slightly larger than the other two.
