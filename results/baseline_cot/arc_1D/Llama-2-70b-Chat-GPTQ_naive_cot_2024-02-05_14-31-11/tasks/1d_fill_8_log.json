The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 3 starting at index 1 and ending at index 3, overlapping with the original object.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"The input sequence has two objects, one of color 7 starting at index 9 and ending at index 11, and another of color 7 starting at index 14 and ending at index 16.

The goal is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of predefined transformations. The transformations include moving, scaling, copying, and removing objects, as well as adding and removing noise pixels.\n\nThe input sequence contains a single object of color 6, starting at index 1 and ending at index 6. We need to move this object to start at index 3 and end at index 8, and resize it to have a size of 3x1 pixels. Additionally, we need to add noise pixels to the output sequence to ensure that it has the same length as the input sequence.\n\nThe instructions provide a general approach to transforming a new input sequence into its output sequence. First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties, such as color, size, and position. Next, we apply transformations to the objects, such as moving them, resizing them, or copying them to a new location. Finally, we add or remove noise pixels as needed and return the resulting output sequence.\n\nThe overall pattern of the input-output relationships suggests that the specific transformations required will depend on the details of the input sequence and the desired output sequence. Therefore, we need to carefully analyze each input-output pair to determine the appropriate transformations to apply."
