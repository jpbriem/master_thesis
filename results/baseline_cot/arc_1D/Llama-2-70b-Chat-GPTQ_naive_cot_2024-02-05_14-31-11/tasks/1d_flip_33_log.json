The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  {\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"The input sequence has a single object of color 2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 4. The output sequence is similar, but with the object's color changed to 8. The noise pixels (0) surrounding the object remain unchanged.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"The input sequence has two objects - one of color 1 starting at index 5 and another of color 6 starting at index 9. The output sequence is similar, but with the objects swapped, so the color 6 object comes before the color 1 object. Again, the noise pixels remain unchanged.\",\n\"Example_3\": \"The input sequence has three objects - one of color 1 starting at index 1, another of color 2 starting at index 3, and a third of color 2 starting at index 6. The output sequence is similar, but with the objects moved so that the color 1 object comes last. The color 2 objects are also swapped, so the second color 2 object comes before the first color 2 object.\",\n\"Overall Pattern\": \"It appears that the transformation applies to objects in the input sequence, moving, resizing, and altering their color. Noise pixels do not change. It also seems that multiple objects can be transformed simultaneously, and their order can be changed.\"\n\"Instructions\": \"To apply the transformation, first identify the objects in the input sequence. Then, based on the given pattern, decide how each object should be modified.
