[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, which are shifted one position to the right in the output sequence, leaving a single 3-pixel object at the beginning. The remaining objects are unchanged.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects of color 5, which are reduced to three objects in the output sequence, keeping their original positions. The fourth object is removed entirely.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects of color 4, which are shifted two positions to the left in the output sequence, creating a gap of two pixels between them. The remaining objects are unchanged."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve moving, scaling, and removing objects while maintaining their original positions and sizes. There might be additional rules governing these transformations, such as conditions for applying them or restrictions on the allowed combinations.",
"instructions": "To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence by their color and position.
2. Determine the desired changes for each object, such as movement, scaling, or removal, based on the given examples.
3. Apply the changes to the corresponding objects in the output sequence, ensuring they remain within the bounds of the sequence and do not overlap with other objects.
4. Return the final output sequence, minding the sequence length!",
