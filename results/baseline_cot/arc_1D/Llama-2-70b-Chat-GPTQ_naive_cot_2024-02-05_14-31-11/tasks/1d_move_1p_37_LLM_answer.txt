prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, located at positions 1, 3, and 5. The output sequence is similar, but the third object has been moved to position 4, and there is an additional object of color 0 at position 7.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has six objects of color 6, located at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. The output sequence is similar, but the objects have been shifted one position to the right, so the first object is now at position 2, and the last object is now at position 8.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has four objects of color 1, located at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7. The output sequence is similar, but the second and fourth objects have been merged into a single object of color 1 at position 4.",
"Overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve applying a series of transformations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and merging objects. The specific transformations used depend on the input sequence itself, and the output sequence represents the result of applying those transformations."
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (color, size, position).
2. Apply the necessary transformations to the objects, such as moving them to a new position, resizing them, or merging them with other objects.
3. Create the output sequence by concatenating the transformed objects in the correct order.
4. Return the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format, minding the sequence length!"
"transformation": {
"input": [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has four objects of color 7, located at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7. There are also four objects of color 0, located at positions 2, 4, 6, and 8.",
"transformed_objects": "The objects in the output sequence should be transformed as follows:
* The first object should be moved to position 2.
* The second object should be resized to twice its original size and moved to position 4.
* The third object should be merged with the fourth object, creating a single object of color 7 at position 6.
* The fifth object should be moved to position 8.",
"output": [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"test_output": np.array([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0])
}

Please note that this is just an example response, and you may need to adjust it according to the actual input and output sequences you are working with.
