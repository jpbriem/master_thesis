prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 1, which is transformed into two objects of color 0 and 1, respectively. The output sequence has a single object of color 0, followed by three objects of color 1.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has a single object of color 7, which is transformed into four objects of color 0 and 7, respectively. The output sequence has a single object of color 0, followed by three objects of color 7.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has a single object of color 2, which is transformed into three objects of color 0 and 2, respectively. The output sequence has a single object of color 0, followed by three objects of color 2."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve transforming each object in the input sequence into multiple objects in the output sequence, with the color of the objects being altered. The number of objects in the output sequence seems to be equal to the number of objects in the input sequence, plus an additional object at the beginning and end of the sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the output sequence with a single object of color 0 at the beginning and end of the sequence.
2. Iterate through each object in the input sequence.
3. If the current object's color matches the color of the previous object in the output sequence, append a new object of the same color to the output sequence. Otherwise, insert a new object of color 0 before appending a new object of the current color.
4. Repeat step 3 until the end of the input sequence is reached.
5. Return the resulting test output sequence.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has a single object of color 7, which spans the entire sequence.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have four objects of color 0 and 7, with the first and last objects being color 0, and the middle two objects being color 7.",
"output": [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],
"test_output": np.array([0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0])
