prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

<</SYS>>
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects: two red objects (colors 6 and 2) and one blue object (color 2). The output sequence moves the blue object to the beginning of the sequence, merges the two red objects, and removes the background color (0) from the end of the sequence.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects: three green objects (color 4) and one yellow object (color 3). The output sequence moves the yellow object to the beginning of the sequence, scales the green objects to twice their original size, and changes the color of the third green object to match the color of the yellow object.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects: one purple object (color 5), one blue object (color 6), and one red object (color 4). The output sequence moves the blue object to the beginning of the sequence, scales the purple object to twice its original size, and changes the color of the red object to match the color of the blue object."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve transforming objects in various ways, including moving, scaling, changing color, and removing or adding objects. The specific transformation depends on the objects present in the input sequence and their positions relative to each other.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).
2. Apply the appropriate transformation to each object based on its properties and the overall pattern.
3. Combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence, ensuring that the order and spacing of the objects matches the input sequence.
4. Return the resulting output sequence.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has three objects: one blue object (color 5), one red object (color 4), and one green object (color 4). The blue object is located at the beginning of the sequence, followed by the red object, and then the green object.",
"transformed_objects": "The blue object should be moved to the end of the sequence, the red object should be scaled up to twice its original size, and the green object should be removed.",
"output": [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"test_output": np.array([0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
}

Note: The input sequence has been modified slightly to better fit the pattern observed in the example inputs.
