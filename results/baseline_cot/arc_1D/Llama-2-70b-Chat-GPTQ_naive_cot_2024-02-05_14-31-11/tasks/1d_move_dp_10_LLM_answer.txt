prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has two objects of color 6, one starting at index 3 and ending at index 5, and another starting at index 7 and ending at index 10. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 6 starting at index 11 and ending at index 12. Additionally, there is a noise pixel (value 0) at index 1.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has three objects of color 4, each starting and ending at indices 6, 9, and 12, respectively. The output sequence is similar, but with the objects shifted to start at indices 7, 10, and 13, respectively.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has four objects of color 2, each starting and ending at indices 3, 6, 9, and 12, respectively. The output sequence is similar, but with the objects shifted to start at indices 4, 7, 10, and 13, respectively.",
"Test_case": "The input sequence has three objects of color 8, each starting and ending at indices 2, 5, and 8, respectively. There are also three noise pixels (values 0) at indices 0, 1, and 9. The output sequence should have the same objects as the input sequence, but with the noise pixels removed."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve applying a series of transformations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and removing objects, as well as adding and removing noise pixels. The specific transformations used seem to depend on the positions and colors of the objects in the input sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, the following steps can be taken:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (such as color, size, position).
2. Apply transformations to the objects, such as moving them to a new position, scaling them up or down, or removing them entirely.
3. Add or remove noise pixels as necessary.
4. Return the resulting output sequence.",

"input": [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
"object_description": "The input sequence has three objects of color 8, each starting and ending at indices 2, 5, and 8, respectively. There are also three noise pixels (values 0) at indices 0, 1, and 9.",
"transformed_objects": "The objects in the output sequence should be the same as those in the input sequence, but without the noise pixels. The objects should be moved to start at indices 4, 7, and 10, respectively, and should be scaled up by a factor of 2.",
