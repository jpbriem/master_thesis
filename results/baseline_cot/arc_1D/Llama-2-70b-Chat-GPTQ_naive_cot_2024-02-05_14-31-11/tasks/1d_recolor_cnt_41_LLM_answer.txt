prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 4, each with a size of 2 pixels. The output sequence has three objects of color 6, each with a size of 3 pixels, shifted to the right by one pixel. There is also an additional object of color 9, with a size of 1 pixel, located at the second position.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects of color 4, each with a size of 2 pixels. The output sequence has four objects of color 6, each with a size of 3 pixels, shifted to the right by one pixel. There is also an additional object of color 9, with a size of 1 pixel, located at the third position."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve transforming objects of color 4 into objects of color 6, with an increase in size from 2 pixels to 3 pixels. The position of the objects remains the same, but there may be some shifting involved. Additionally, there seems to be a new object of color 9 introduced in the output sequence, located at a specific position.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color and size.
2. For each object, calculate its new size and position in the output sequence based on the patterns observed in the examples.
3. Create a new output sequence with the transformed objects, taking care to maintain the correct position and size for each object.
4. Add any new objects of color 9 that need to be introduced in the output sequence, according to the patterns observed in the examples.",
