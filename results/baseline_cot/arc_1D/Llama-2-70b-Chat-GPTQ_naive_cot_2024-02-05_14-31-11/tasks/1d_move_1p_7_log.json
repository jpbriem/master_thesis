The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  {\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"The input sequence has three objects of color 3, located at positions 1, 3, and 5. The output sequence is similar, but the objects have moved to positions 2, 4, and 6, respectively.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"The input sequence has two objects of color 2, located at positions 1 and 3. The output sequence is similar, but the objects have been duplicated and moved to positions 2 and 4, respectively.\",\n\"Example_3\": \"The input sequence has three objects of color 3, located at positions 1, 3, and 5. The output sequence is similar, but the objects have been scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, resulting in larger objects at the same positions.\",\n\"Overall_Pattern\": \"The input-output relationship appears to involve moving, scaling, and copying objects, possibly based on certain conditions or rules. The specific actions required to transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence seem to vary depending on the given input.\",\n\"Instructions\": \"To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, one needs to carefully examine the input sequence, identify the individual objects, their sizes, positions, and colors, and then apply the appropriate transformation actions to each object, such as moving, scaling, copying, or removing, while also taking into account any conditions or rules that may apply.\",\n\"Transformation\": {\n\"Input\": \"Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\",\n\"Object Description\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n\"Transformed Objects\": \"Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color.\",\n\"Output\": \"Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\"\n},\n\"Test Output\": \"Return the created test output sequence in NumPy array format. Mind the sequence length!\"\n}\n\nFor the test input sequence [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], the desired output sequence could be [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], which can be achieved by applying the following transformation actions:\n\n1. Move the first object of color 4 from position 1 to position 2.\n2. Copy the second object of color 4 from position 3 to position 4.\n3. Scale the third object of color 4 from position 5 to twice its original size, resulting in a new position of 6.\n4. Remove the fourth object of color 4 at position 7, as it is entirely contained within the scaled object at position 6.\n\nTherefore, the final transformed objects description would be:\n\n* Object 1: Color 4, start index 2, end index 2, size 1.\n* Object 2: Color 4, start index 4, end index 4, size 1.\n* Object 3: Color 4, start index 6, end index 7, size 2.\n\nAnd the resulting test output sequence in NumPy array format would be:\n\n[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]"
