prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

<</SYS>>
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, located at positions 1, 3, and 5. The output sequence has the same objects, but with a different position: object 1 is now at position 2, object 2 is now at position 4, and object 3 is now at position 6. Additionally, there are three noise pixels (0) at positions 0, 2, and 7 in the input sequence, which are removed in the output sequence.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects of color 2, located at positions 1 and 3. The output sequence has the same objects, but with a different position: object 1 is now at position 2, and object 2 is now at position 5. Additionally, there is one noise pixel (0) at position 4 in the input sequence, which is removed in the output sequence.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, located at positions 1, 3, and 5. The output sequence has the same objects, but with a different position: object 1 is now at position 2, object 2 is now at position 4, and object 3 is now at position 6. Additionally, there are three noise pixels (0) at positions 0, 2, and 7 in the input sequence, which are removed in the output sequence."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to follow a pattern of moving objects to the next position, removing noise pixels, and scaling objects up or down. The pattern also involves copying parts of the input sequence and reversing them.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Move each object to the next position. If an object reaches the end of the sequence, wrap it around to the beginning.
2. Remove any noise pixels (0) from the sequence.
3. Scale each object up or down by a factor of 2.
4. Reverse the order of every other object.
5. Copy parts of the input sequence and reverse them.
6. Concatenate all the modified objects and remaining noise pixels to form the output sequence.",
"transformation": {
"input": [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has four objects of color 4, located at positions 1, 2, 3, and 6. There are also three noise pixels (0) at positions 0, 5, and 7.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have the same four objects of color 4, but with a different position: object 1 should be at position 2, object 2 should be at position 4, object 3 should be at position 6, and object 4 should be at position 8. There should be no noise pixels in the output sequence.",
"output": [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0],
"test_output": np.array([0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0])
}

Note: The description field provides a detailed explanation of the transformation pattern observed in the input-output pairs. The overall_pattern field summarizes the transformation pattern and provides a high-level overview of the instructions to generate the output sequence. The instructions field provides step-by-step instructions to transform a new input sequence into its output sequence. The transformation field contains the actual input sequence, the description of the objects in the input sequence, and the transformed objects in the output sequence. Finally, the test_output field contains the expected output sequence for the given input sequence.
