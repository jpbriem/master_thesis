prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Description:

The input sequence consists of 16 pixels, with values ranging from 0 to 7. There are three objects in the sequence - two objects with value 7 and one object with value 0. The first object with value 7 starts at index 3 and ends at index 5, the second object with value 7 starts at index 9 and ends at index 11, and the third object with value 0 starts at index 0 and ends at index 2.

The output sequence is similar to the input sequence, but with some modifications. The first object with value 7 has been moved to start at index 0 and end at index 2, overlapping with the third object with value 0. The second object with value 7 has been moved to start at index 8 and end at index 10, no longer overlapping with the first object. The third object with value 0 has been removed.

Overall Pattern:

The input-output relationship can be described as follows:

* Objects in the input sequence are either moved or removed in the output sequence.
* The order of objects in the input sequence may be preserved or reversed in the output sequence.
* Objects in the input sequence may overlap with each other, and the output sequence may contain fewer or more objects than the input sequence.

Instructions:

To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence by their color values.
2. Determine the starting and ending indices of each object.
3. Decide whether to move, remove, or copy each object.
4. Update the positions of objects according to the decided actions.
5. Create the resulting output sequence.
