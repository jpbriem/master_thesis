            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  {\n\"description\": {\n\"Example_1\": \"The input sequence has three objects: two red objects (colors 2) and one blue object (color 3). The output sequence is the same as the input sequence, but with an additional red object at the end.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"The input sequence has two objects: one red object (color 4) and one green object (color 0). The output sequence is the same as the input sequence, but with the red object duplicated and moved to the end.\",\n\"Example_3\": \"The input sequence has two objects: one yellow object (color 7) and one red object (color 0). The output sequence is the same as the input sequence, but with the yellow object duplicated and moved to the end.\",\n\"Test Case\": \"The input sequence has four objects: three red objects (colors 3) and one blue object (color 0). The output sequence should have four objects: three red objects and one blue object, with the blue object moved to the end.\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"The input-output relationship appears to involve manipulating objects in the input sequence, specifically moving, copying, and scaling them. The output sequence seems to maintain the same number of objects as the input sequence, but with potentially different positions, sizes, and colors.\",\n\"instructions\": \"To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their color.\n2. Determine the desired changes to each object, such as moving, copying, or scaling.\n3. Apply the changes to the objects in the input sequence to create the output sequence.\n4. Return the resulting output sequence.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n\"object_description\": \"The input sequence has four objects: three red objects (colors 3) and one blue object (color 0). The red objects are located at indices 1, 3, and 6, while the blue object is located at index 8.\",\n\"transformed_objects\": \"The output sequence should have four objects: three red objects and one blue object, with the blue object moved to the end. The red objects should remain unchanged, while the blue object should be copied and pasted at the end of the sequence.\",\n\"output\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n\"test_output\": np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0])\n}\n```\nNote that the provided input-output pairs demonstrate the movement, copying, and scaling of objects, which suggests that the task involves manipulating objects in the input sequence to produce the output sequence. The instructions offer a general approach to transforming a new input sequence into its output sequence, while the transformation section provides specific information about the test input and output sequences."
