prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has two objects of color 2 and 4, respectively. The output sequence moves the object of color 4 to the beginning of the sequence and scales it up to twice its original size. It also removes the last three zeros from the input sequence.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has three objects of colors 4, 7, and 0. The output sequence moves the object of color 7 to the beginning of the sequence and scales it up to thrice its original size. It also removes the last four zeros from the input sequence.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has four objects of colors 5, 7, 7, and 0. The output sequence moves the object of color 7 to the beginning of the sequence and scales it up to thrice its original size. It also removes the last five zeros from the input sequence."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship shows a pattern of moving objects to the beginning of the sequence and scaling them up, while removing some trailing zeros from the input sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their color values.
2. Move each object to the beginning of the sequence, maintaining their relative positions.
3. Scale each object up to a larger size, using a factor of 2 or 3, depending on the object's color.
4. Remove any trailing zeros from the input sequence.
",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has one object of color 2 and one object of color 1. The object of color 2 spans four positions, starting from the fifth index, and has a size of 2. The object of color 1 starts at the seventh index and has a size of 1.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have two objects: an object of color 2 that spans six positions, starting from the second index, and has a size of 4; and an object of color 1 that starts at the eighth index and has a size of 2.",
"output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0],
"test_output": np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0])
}

Please note that this is just an example response, and you may need to adjust it according to the specific requirements of the task you're working on.
