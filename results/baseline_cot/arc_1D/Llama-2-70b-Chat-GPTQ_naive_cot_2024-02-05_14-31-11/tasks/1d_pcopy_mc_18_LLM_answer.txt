prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 9, separated by two noise pixels (color 0) and followed by another object of color 8. The output sequence is similar, but the last object has been transformed into three consecutive objects of color 8, separated by two noise pixels.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects of color 8, separated by three noise pixels (color 0), followed by an object of color 9. The output sequence is similar, but the last object has been transformed into four consecutive objects of color 9, separated by three noise pixels."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve transforming objects of certain colors (e.g., 8 and 9) into other objects of the same or different colors, possibly scaling them up or down, and moving them around. Noise pixels (color 0) seem to play a role in separating objects.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their color and location.
2. Determine the desired transformation for each object, such as moving, scaling, or changing color.
3. Apply the transformations to the objects while maintaining their original positions relative to each other.
4. Add noise pixels as needed to separate objects or create space between them.
5. Output the resulting sequence, minding the sequence length!",

"input": [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence contains five objects: three objects of color 8, one object of color 5, and one noise pixel (color 0). The objects are arranged in a specific order, with some spaces between them.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have the same objects as the input sequence, but with some changes:

* The first three objects of color 8 should be transformed into three consecutive objects of color 8, separated by two noise pixels.
* The fourth object of color 5 should remain unchanged.
* The last object of color 8 should be transformed into three consecutive objects of color 8, separated by two noise pixels.",
