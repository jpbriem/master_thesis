prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 4, starting at index 4 and ending at index 8. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 3, starting at index 12 and ending at index 13.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects, one of color 7, starting at index 7 and ending at index 13, and another of color 3, starting at index 16 and ending at index 17. The output sequence is similar, but with the objects shifted by one index, so the color 7 object starts at index 6 and ends at index 12, and the color 3 object starts at index 15 and ends at index 16."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve applying a series of transformations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and adding noise. The specific transformations used seem to depend on the position and color of the objects in the input sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output, we need to apply the following steps:

1. Move the objects in the input sequence by some fixed amount (e.g., 1 or 2 indices).
2. Scale the objects in the input sequence by some factor (e.g., double or triple their size).
3. Add noise pixels to the input sequence, possibly with a probability that depends on the object's color.
4. Output the resulting sequence, possibly after trimming off excess pixels from the beginning or end.",

"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence contains three objects: a single object of color 4, starting at index 4 and ending at index 8, and two objects of color 3, starting at index 12 and ending at index 13, and another of color 7, starting at index 16 and ending at index 17.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have the same objects as the input sequence, but with some modifications:

* The color 4 object should be moved by 2 indices, so it starts at index 6 and ends at index 10.
* The color 3 object should be scaled up by a factor of 2, so it becomes twice as large.
* The color 7 object should be moved by 1 index, so it starts at index 15 and ends at index 18.",
