prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 3, starting at index 2 and ending at index 6, with a size of 4. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 4 starting at index 10 and ending at index 11, with a size of 1.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has a single object of color 5, starting at index 2 and ending at index 9, with a size of 7. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 4 starting at index 10 and ending at index 11, with a size of 1."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve copying the input sequence and adding a new object of color 4 at the end, possibly with a fixed position and size.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Copy the input sequence.
2. Add a new object of color 4 at the end of the sequence, with a fixed position and size (e.g., starting at index 10 and ending at index 11, with a size of 1).",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has a single object of color 8, starting at index 2 and ending at index 11, with a size of 9.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have two objects: the original object of color 8, and a new object of color 4 starting at index 10 and ending at index 11, with a size of 1.",
"output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]

"test_output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]
}

Note: The description field provides a brief summary of the transformation pattern observed in the input-output pairs, while the instructions field outlines the specific steps required to transform a new input sequence into its output sequence. The transformation field contains the actual input and output sequences, along with a detailed description of the objects in the input sequence and how they should be transformed in the output sequence. Finally, the test output field contains the expected output sequence for the given input sequence.
