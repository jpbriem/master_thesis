prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 2, which is transformed into a new object of the same color and size but shifted to the right. The output sequence has a single object of color 2, starting from index 1 and ending at index 8, with a size of 7.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects of color 1 and 2, respectively. The first object (color 1) is transformed into a new object of the same color and size but shifted to the right, while the second object (color 2) remains unchanged. The output sequence has two objects: the first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 4, with a size of 4; the second object starts at index 6 and ends at index 9, with a size of 4.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has a single object of color 5, which is transformed into three new objects of the same color but different sizes. The first new object starts at index 1 and ends at index 4, with a size of 4; the second new object starts at index 6 and ends at index 9, with a size of 4; the third new object starts at index 10 and ends at index 13, with a size of 4. The output sequence has three objects: the first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 4, with a size of 4; the second object starts at index 6 and ends at index 9, with a size of 4; the third object starts at index 10 and ends at index 13, with a size of 4."
},
"overall_pattern": "The transformation pattern involves moving, resizing, and copying objects, as well as creating new objects from existing ones. The goal is to create an output sequence that contains the same number of objects as the input sequence, but with potentially different positions, sizes, and colors.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (color, position, size).
2. Apply the necessary transformations to each object, such as moving, resizing, or copying it.
3. Create new objects if necessary, taking into account their position, size, and color.
4. Assemble the transformed objects into the final output sequence, ensuring that they do not overlap or violate any constraints.
