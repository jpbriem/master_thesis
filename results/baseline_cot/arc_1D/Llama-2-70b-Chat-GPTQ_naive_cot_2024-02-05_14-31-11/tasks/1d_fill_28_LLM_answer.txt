prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects: two zero-pixel objects and one five-pixel object. The output sequence has the same objects, but the five-pixel object has been moved to the right and expanded to cover the entire sequence.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has three objects: a three-pixel object, followed by two zero-pixel objects. The output sequence has the same objects, but the three-pixel object has been duplicated and moved to the right.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has two objects: a six-pixel object, followed by a zero-pixel object. The output sequence has the same objects, but the six-pixel object has been expanded to cover the entire sequence.",
"Test_case": "The input sequence has four objects: three zero-pixel objects and a seven-pixel object. The output sequence should have the same objects, but the seven-pixel object should be moved to the right and expanded to cover the entire sequence."
},
"overall_pattern": "The transformation pattern involves moving, scaling, and copying objects, as well as changing their color. The goal is to create a new sequence where the objects are modified in a specific way, while maintaining their original positions and sizes.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their properties (size, position, color).
2. Apply the necessary transformations to each object, such as moving, scaling, copying, or changing color.
3. Combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence, ensuring that they maintain their original positions and sizes.
4. Return the resulting output sequence.",
"transformation": {
"input": [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has four objects: three zero-pixel objects and a seven-pixel object. The seven-pixel object is located at the beginning of the sequence and spans the first seven positions.",
"transformed_objects": "The seven-pixel object should be moved to the right and expanded to cover the entire sequence. The remaining objects should remain unchanged.",
"output": [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
"test_output": np.array([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7])
