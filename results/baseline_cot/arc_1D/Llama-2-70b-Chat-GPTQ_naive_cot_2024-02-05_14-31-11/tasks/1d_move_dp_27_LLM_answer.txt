prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 1, which is shifted to the left by one pixel in the output sequence.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has three objects of color 7, which are shifted to the right by two pixels in the output sequence, and the last object is resized to fit the remaining space.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects of color 2, which are merged into a single object in the output sequence, and moved to the right by one pixel.",
"Overall_Pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve shifting and resizing objects, possibly based on their color. There may also be some logic involving the number of objects and their positions."
},
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color.
2. Determine the position and size of each object.
3. Apply transformations to the objects, such as shifting, scaling, and merging, based on their color and position.
4. Create the output sequence by applying the transformations to the objects in the correct order.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
"object_description": "The input sequence has four objects: three objects of color 7 and one object of color 9. The objects are located at positions 1, 3, and 6, respectively. The sizes of the objects are 3, 3, and 1, respectively.",
"transformed_objects": "The objects in the output sequence should be transformed as follows:
* The first object (color 7) should be shifted to the right by 2 pixels and resized to fit the remaining space.
* The second object (color 7) should be shifted to the right by 2 pixels and resized to fit the remaining space.
* The third object (color 7) should be shifted to the right by 2 pixels and resized to fit the remaining space.
* The fourth object (color 9) should be shifted to the right by 1 pixel and resized to fit the remaining space.",
"output": [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9],
"test_output": np.array([0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9])
