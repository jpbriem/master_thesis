prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects: two zero-pixel objects of size 1 each, and one six-pixel object of color 6. The output sequence is similar, but the six-pixel object has been moved to the right and overlaps with the last four-pixel object, which has been extended to the left.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects: three eight-pixel objects of color 8 and one seven-pixel object of color 7. The output sequence is similar, but the seven-pixel object has been moved to the left and overlaps with the second eight-pixel object, which has been extended to the right.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects: a three-pixel object of color 3, a four-pixel object of color 4, and a zero-pixel object of size 1. The output sequence is similar, but the four-pixel object has been moved to the right and overlaps with the three-pixel object, which has been extended to the left."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve moving and resizing objects while maintaining their original colors. The goal seems to be to optimize the placement and size of objects to minimize empty space and maximize the number of objects that can fit in the given sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their size, position, and color.
2. Move the objects around to optimize their placement and reduce empty space.
3. Resize the objects to fit them snugly next to each other and eliminate any remaining empty space.
4. Return the resulting transformed sequence as the output.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has five objects: four zero-pixel objects of size 1 each and one five-pixel object of color 5. The five-pixel object is located at the fifth position and has a size of 5.",
"transformed_objects": "The five-pixel object should be moved to the third position and resized to fit snugly next to the surrounding zero-pixel objects. The resulting sequence should have no empty space and consist of five objects: four zero-pixel objects of size 1 each and one five-pixel object of color 5 located at the third position.",
