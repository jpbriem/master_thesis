prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 8, which are shifted by one pixel to the right in the output sequence.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects of color 2, which are separated by a single pixel of color 0. The output sequence has the same objects, but the second object is shifted by one pixel to the left.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects of color 4, which are shifted by one pixel to the right in the output sequence."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to be a simple transformation where objects are shifted by a single pixel in either the horizontal or vertical direction.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their color.
2. Determine the position and size of each object.
3. Shift each object by a single pixel in the appropriate direction (horizontally or vertically) based on the object's position and size.
4. Create the output sequence by combining the shifted objects.
5. Return the resulting output sequence.",
