The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

The red objects are moved to the right, so the output sequence has two red objects at the end.\",\n\"Example_2\": \"The input sequence has four objects: three green (color 8) objects and one blue (color 4) object. The green objects are duplicated and moved to the beginning and end of the sequence, while the blue object remains unchanged.\",\n\"Example_3\": \"The input sequence has four objects: four green (color 8) objects. All objects are moved to the beginning of the sequence.\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"The input-output relationship shows a pattern of moving and copying objects, as well as changing their color. The order of the objects in the output sequence is not necessarily the same as in the input sequence.\",\n\"instructions\": \"To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their color.\n2. Move each object to its desired position in the output sequence.\n3. Duplicate each object if necessary.\n4.
