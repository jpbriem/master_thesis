prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 9, which is transformed into two objects of color 9 and 3, respectively. The output sequence has the same objects as the input sequence, but with a differently colored background (0 instead of 9).",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, 8, and 2, respectively. The objects are rearranged in the output sequence, with the object of color 3 being duplicated and moved to the beginning and end of the sequence. The object of color 8 is removed, and the object of color 2 is replaced with an object of color 3.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has four objects of color 7, 4, 7, and 7, respectively. The objects are rearranged in the output sequence, with the objects of color 7 being moved to the beginning and end of the sequence, and the object of color 4 being replaced with an object of color 7."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to follow a pattern of object manipulation, where objects are moved, copied, or modified in some way. The output sequence seems to always have the same number of objects as the input sequence, but with potentially different colors or positions.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, one needs to carefully examine the input sequence, identify the individual objects, and apply the necessary transformations to each object. The transformations may include moving, copying, scaling, removing, or recoloring objects. Additionally, the output sequence may have a different background color than the input sequence.",

"object_description": "The input sequence has 13 objects of colors 0, 1, 9, and 7, respectively. The objects range in size from 1 to 4 pixels, and their positions vary across the sequence.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have the same 13 objects as the input sequence, but with potentially different colors or positions. Specifically, the objects of color 0 should be replaced with objects of color 9, and the objects of color 7 should be moved to the beginning and end of the sequence.",
