prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has two objects of color 3, one starting at index 3 and ending at index 6, and another starting at index 9 and ending at index 12. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 2 starting at index 10 and ending at index 11.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has three objects of color 5, one starting at index 3 and ending at index 9, another starting at index 10 and ending at index 16, and a third starting at index 17 and ending at index 23. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 2 starting at index 14 and ending at index 15."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve applying a series of transformations to the input sequence, including moving, scaling, and adding objects. The specific transformations used seem to depend on the positions and colors of the objects in the input sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output, the following steps could be taken:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (color, position, size).
2. Apply transformations to the objects, such as moving them to new positions, scaling them up or down, or changing their color.
3. Add new objects to the sequence if necessary.
4. Remove objects that are no longer present in the output sequence.
5. Repeat the above steps until the desired output sequence is obtained.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has four objects: two objects of color 0, one starting at index 0 and ending at index 2, and another starting at index 8 and ending at index 10; an object of color 8, starting at index 6 and ending at index 12; and an object of color 2, starting at index 18 and ending at index 19.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have the same objects as the input sequence, but with some changes in position and size. Specifically, the first object of color 0 should be moved to start at index 3 and end at index 5, the second object of color 0 should be moved to start at index 11 and end at index 13, the object of color 8 should be scaled up to twice its original size, and the object of color 2 should be removed.",
"output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0]
}
```

Note: The description field provides a brief summary of the transformation pattern observed in the input-output pairs, while the instructions field outlines the steps required to transform a new input sequence into its output. The transformation field contains the actual input sequence and its corresponding output sequence, along with descriptions of the objects in both sequences and how they should be transformed.
