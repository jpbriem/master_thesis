prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Description:

The input sequence consists of 18 pixels, with values ranging from 0 to 6, representing different colors. There are three objects in the sequence - two objects with color 6 and one object with color 0. The first object with color 6 has a size of 5 pixels (from index 1 to 5), the second object with color 6 has a size of 4 pixels (from index 9 to 12), and the third object with color 0 has a size of 7 pixels (from index 13 to 19).

The output sequence is similar to the input sequence, but with some modifications. The first object with color 6 has been moved to the beginning of the sequence (index 0) and has been resized to 6 pixels (from index 0 to 5). The second object with color 6 has been moved to the end of the sequence (index 12) and has been resized to 4 pixels (from index 9 to 12). The third object with color 0 has been removed from the sequence.

Overall Pattern:

The input-output relationship can be described as follows:

* Objects are either moved or resized or both.
* Objects can be merged, split or remain unchanged.
* Noise pixels may be added or removed.
* Arithmetic operations may be performed on objects, such as counting, sorting, etc.
* Conditional rules may be applied to objects.

Instructions:

To transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Move the first object with color 6 to the beginning of the sequence.
2. Resize the first object with color 6 to 6 pixels.
3. Move the second object with color 6 to the end of the sequence.
4. Resize the second object with color 6 to 4 pixels.
5. Remove the third object with color 0 from the sequence.
