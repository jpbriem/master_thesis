prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 3, starting at index 11 and ending at index 14. The output sequence has the same object, but shifted to the right by 4 positions, so it starts at index 15 and ends at index 18.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects, one of color 5 starting at index 6 and ending at index 12, and another of color 7 starting at index 13 and ending at index 19. The output sequence has the same objects, but the order is swapped, so the object of color 5 comes first, followed by the object of color 7. Additionally, the object of color 5 is shifted to the right by 4 positions, so it starts at index 10 and ends at index 16, while the object of color 7 starts at index 17 and ends at index 23.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects, one of color 1 starting at index 9 and ending at index 12, one of color 4 starting at index 10 and ending at index 18, and one of color 4 starting at index 19 and ending at index 23. The output sequence has the same objects, but the order is altered, so the object of color 1 comes first, followed by the objects of color 4. Additionally, the object of color 1 is shifted to the left by 4 positions, so it starts at index 5 and ends at index 8, while the objects of color 4 start at indices 6 and 14 and end at indices 10 and 18, respectively."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve moving or shifting objects in the sequence, sometimes swapping their order, and possibly changing their size. The changes seem to be governed by simple arithmetic operations, such as adding or subtracting fixed numbers of positions to the start and end indices of objects.",
"instructions": "To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence, including their color, start index, end index, and size (number of pixels).
2. Apply any necessary moves or shifts to the objects, either individually or collectively, using basic arithmetic operations.
3. Update the start and end indices of the objects accordingly.
4. Return the resulting output sequence, minding the sequence length!",

"object_description": "The input sequence contains four objects: one of color 7 starting at index 11 and ending at index 14, one of color 5 starting at index 13 and ending at index 19, and two of color 5 starting at indices 6 and 10 and ending at indices 12 and 16, respectively.",
"transformed_objects": "The objects in the output sequence should be modified as follows:
* The object of color 7 should be shifted to the right by 4 positions, so it starts at index 15 and ends at index 18.
* The first object of color 5 should be shifted to the right by 4 positions, so it starts at index 10 and ends at index 16.
* The second object of color 5 should be moved to the beginning of the sequence, so it starts at index 6 and ends at index 12.
* The third object of color 5 should be removed entirely.",
