The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

The output sequence moves the yellow object to the third position, overlapping with the green objects, which are scaled up to cover the entire output sequence.\",\n\"Example_3\": \"The input sequence has three objects: two yellow (2) and one red (7). The output sequence moves the red object to the last position, leaving the yellow objects unchanged.\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"The input-output relationship shows a pattern of moving, scaling, and copying objects while maintaining their original positions and sizes. The output sequence seems to be derived from the input sequence by applying a series of transformations that prioritize preserving the original objects' properties.\",\n\"instructions\": \"To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their colors.\n2. Determine the position and size of each object.\n3. Apply transformations to the objects, such as moving, scaling, or copying them, while maintaining their original properties.\n4. Overlap or contain objects in the output sequence, ensuring that their positions and sizes are consistent with the input sequence.\n5. Return the resulting output sequence, which should have the same length as the input sequence.\",\n\"transformation\": {\n\"input\": [0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n\"object_description\": \"The input sequence has four objects: three blue (4) and one red (6).
