[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]



Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, with sizes 3, 3, and 3, and one object of color 2 with size 2. The output sequence adds an additional object of color 3 with size 3 at the beginning, and removes the last object of color 2.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has six objects of color 6, with sizes 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, and 6, and two objects of color 2 with sizes 2 and 2. The output sequence adds an additional object of color 6 with size 6 at the beginning and end, and changes all objects of color 2 to color 6.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has four objects of color 1, with sizes 1, 1, 1, and 1, and one object of color 2 with size 2. The output sequence adds an additional object of color 1 with size 1 at the beginning, and changes all objects of color 1 to color 2."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to follow a pattern of adding or removing objects, scaling objects up or down, and changing colors. The specific transformation depends on the input sequence and may involve multiple steps.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, the following steps can be taken:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).
2. Determine the desired transformation(s) based on the input sequence and the overall pattern.
3. Apply the transformation(s) to the objects in the input sequence, maintaining their original position and order.
4. Return the resulting output sequence, ensuring it has the correct length.",

"input": [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
"object_description": "The input sequence has four objects of color 7, with sizes 7, 7, 7, and 7, and one object of color 2 with size 2. ",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have five objects of color 7, with sizes 7, 7, 7, 7, and 7, and one object of color 2 with size 2, shifted to the right by three positions.",
