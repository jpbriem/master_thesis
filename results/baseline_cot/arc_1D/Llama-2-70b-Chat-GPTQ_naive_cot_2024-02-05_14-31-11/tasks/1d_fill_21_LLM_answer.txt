prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects: two objects of color 0 (background) and one object of color 3. The output sequence is similar, but the middle object of color 0 has been replaced by an object of color 3.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects: three objects of color 0 (background) and one object of color 3. The output sequence is similar, but the last three objects of color 0 have been replaced by objects of color 3.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has two objects: one object of color 7 and one object of color 0 (background). The output sequence is similar, but the object of color 7 has been duplicated and moved to the end of the sequence."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve copying the input sequence and modifying it by replacing certain objects with new objects of the same color, while maintaining the original order and positions of the objects. The modifications seem to be determined by the colors of the objects and their positions relative to each other.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Copy the input sequence.
2. Identify the objects in the sequence and determine their colors, sizes, and positions.
3. Apply the following transformations to the objects, depending on their colors and positions:
	* If an object is entirely contained within another object of the same color, replace it with an object of the same color and size.
	* If an object is partially contained within another object of the same color, shrink the containing object to exclude the overlapping part.
	* If an object is not contained within any other object, leave it unchanged.
4. Return the resulting transformed sequence as the output sequence.",
"transformation": {
"input": [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence contains two objects: one object of color 7 and one object of color 0 (background). The object of color 7 has a size of 1 and is located at index 1, while the object of color 0 has a size of 8 and is located at indices 2-9.",
"transformed_objects": "The objects in the output sequence should be modified as follows:

* The object of color 7 should be duplicated and moved to the end of the sequence, resulting in two identical objects of color 7 at indices 1 and 10.
* The object of color 0 should be shrunk to exclude the overlapping part with the object of color 7, resulting in a smaller object of color 0 at indices 2-5.",
