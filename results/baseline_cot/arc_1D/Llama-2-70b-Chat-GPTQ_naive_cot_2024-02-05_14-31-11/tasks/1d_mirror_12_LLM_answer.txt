[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, located at positions 1, 5, and 9. The output sequence has the same objects, but with a different position and size. Object 1 has been moved to position 6, object 2 has been resized from 3 to 6, and object 3 has been removed. There are also some noise pixels (color 0) added to the output sequence.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects of color 2, located at positions 1, 5, 9, and 10. The output sequence has the same objects, but with a different position and size. Object 1 has been moved to position 7, object 2 has been resized from 2 to 4, object 3 has been resized from 2 to 3, and object 4 has been removed. There are also some noise pixels (color 0) added to the output sequence."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve moving and resizing objects, as well as adding and removing noise pixels. It seems that objects can be copied, hollowed, scaled, and removed, and their positions and sizes can be adjusted. Additionally, there may be conditions that determine which transformations are applied to each object.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (position, size, color).
2. Apply transformations to the objects based on the given instructions (e.g., move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor).
3. Add noise pixels to the output sequence if necessary.
4. Return the resulting output sequence.

Note: The specific instructions for each transformation are not yet clear, so further analysis is needed to determine the exact rules governing this task.",
"transformation": {
"input": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence contains five objects of color 1, located at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. They all have a size of 1.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have the same five objects, but with potentially different positions and sizes. Object 1 should be moved to position 6, object 2 should be resized from 1 to 2, object 3 should be resized from 1 to 3, object 4 should be resized from 1 to 4, and object 5 should be removed.",
