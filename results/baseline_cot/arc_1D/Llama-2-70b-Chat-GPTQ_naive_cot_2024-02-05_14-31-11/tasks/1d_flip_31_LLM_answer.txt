prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 5, starting at index 11 and ending at index 14. The output sequence has the same object, but shifted to the right by 3 positions, so it starts at index 14 and ends at index 17.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects, one of color 4 starting at index 5 and ending at index 9, and another of color 8 starting at index 10 and ending at index 16. The output sequence has the same objects, but the order is swapped, so the color 8 object comes first, followed by the color 4 object.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects, one of color 7 starting at index 11 and ending at index 14, another of color 8 starting at index 15 and ending at index 18, and a third of color 7 again starting at index 19 and ending at index 22. The output sequence has the same objects, but the color 7 objects are moved to the beginning and end of the sequence, respectively, while the color 8 object remains unchanged."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve moving, resizing, and recoloring objects, as well as shuffling their order. The specific actions taken seem to depend on the colors and positions of the objects in the input sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, we need to apply a series of operations based on the objects present in the input sequence. First, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their properties, such as color, size, and position. Then, we can apply the necessary transformations to each object, such as moving it to a different position, changing its color, or resizing it. Finally, we need to combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence, possibly with some additional noise pixels added to fill out the sequence.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has a single object of color 6, starting at index 11 and ending at index 14.",
"transformed_objects": "The object should be moved to start at index 14 and end at index 17, and its color should be changed to 7.",
"output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
