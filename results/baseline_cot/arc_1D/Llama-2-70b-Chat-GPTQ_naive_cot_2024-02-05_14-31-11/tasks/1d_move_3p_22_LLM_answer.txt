prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, which are shifted to the right in the output sequence, leaving a gap of zero-valued pixels in between. The object on the left remains unchanged.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has nine objects of color 7, which are separated by single zero-valued pixels. In the output sequence, these objects are moved to the right, so that they are aligned at the right edge of the image, leaving a large area of zero-valued pixels on the left.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has four objects of color 3, which are reduced to a single object of the same color in the output sequence, by merging the original objects. Additionally, there are now three zero-valued pixels between the objects, whereas there were four in the input sequence."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship can be described as a combination of object manipulation and noise addition. Objects are transformed by moving, scaling, and merging, while noise pixels are added to create gaps or fill empty spaces. The output sequence always starts and ends with zero-valued pixels, indicating the background color.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence by their color and position.
2. Apply transformations to the objects, such as moving, scaling, or merging, based on the desired output.
3. Add noise pixels to create gaps or fill empty spaces, ensuring that the output sequence starts and ends with zero-valued pixels.
4. Return the resulting output sequence, minding the sequence length!"
,"transformation": {
"input": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence contains five objects of color 1, located consecutively. Their sizes and positions are identical.",
"transformed_objects": "After transformation, these objects should be merged into a single object of the same color, starting from the leftmost position and ending at the rightmost position of the current objects. There should be three zero-valued pixels between the merged object and the background color at the beginning and end of the sequence.",
