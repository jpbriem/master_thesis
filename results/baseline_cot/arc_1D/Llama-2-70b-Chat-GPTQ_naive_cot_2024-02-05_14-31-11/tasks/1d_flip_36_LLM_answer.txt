prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 8, which is moved to the second position and expanded to cover the entire output sequence. The remaining pixels are set to zero.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has two objects of colors 5 and 8. The objects are swapped and the color 5 object is scaled up to cover the entire output sequence. The remaining pixels are set to zero.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has three objects of colors 5, 6, and 0. The objects are rearranged and combined, with the color 5 object being removed and the color 6 object being duplicated. The remaining pixels are set to zero."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve manipulating objects in the input sequence, such as moving, scaling, and combining them, while setting the remaining pixels to zero. The specific actions taken depend on the colors and positions of the objects in the input sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their colors and positions.
2. Apply the necessary transformations to the objects, such as moving, scaling, or combining them.
3. Set the remaining pixels to zero.
4. Return the resulting output sequence.",

"transformed_objects": "The objects in the output sequence should be transformed as follows:

* The color 2 object should be moved to position 2 and expanded to cover the entire output sequence.
* The color 5 objects should be combined into a single object covering positions 3-7.
