prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has a single object of color 1, which is transformed into two objects of color 1 and 9, respectively. The output sequence has the same single object of color 1.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has three objects of color 1, 4, and 1, respectively. The objects are rearranged in the output sequence, with the color 1 object becoming the second object, followed by the color 4 object, and then the color 1 object again. The output sequence also includes an additional object of color 9 at the end.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has a single object of color 4, which is transformed into four objects of color 4, 2, 4, and 5, respectively. The output sequence includes an additional object of color 1 at the beginning and end, and the objects are rearranged such that the color 4 objects are together, followed by the color 2 object, then the color 4 object again, and finally the color 5 object."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve transforming a single object or multiple objects into a different number of objects, possibly with different colors, positions, and sizes. The transformed objects may also be rearranged in the output sequence.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their color, position, and size.
2. Determine the desired transformation for each object, such as moving, resizing, or changing color.
3. Apply the transformations to the objects in the input sequence to create the output sequence.
4. Rearrange the objects in the output sequence if necessary, such as grouping similar colored objects together or placing them in a specific order.
5. Return the resulting output sequence, ensuring it has the correct length."
