prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 3, located at positions 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12. The output sequence adds an additional object of color 8, located at positions 13-15, and scales the existing objects upwards by 2 units each, so they now cover 3 units each. The background color (0) remains unchanged.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects of color 3, located at positions 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, and 13-15. The output sequence changes the color of the second and fourth objects to 8, shifts their starting positions by -2 units, and scales them downwards by a factor of 2. The remaining two objects remain unchanged.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has five objects of color 3, located at positions 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, and 16-18. The output sequence moves the third object by +2 units, scales it upwards by a factor of 2, and changes its color to 8. It also removes the last object (position 18).",
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship shows a consistent pattern of adding, removing, scaling, and changing colors of objects. The added objects always have a color of 8, while the existing objects are either scaled up or removed. The starting positions of the objects can also be shifted by a fixed amount.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by their color and position.
2. Check if there are any objects that need to be added, removed, scaled, or recolored.
3. Perform the necessary operations on the objects, maintaining their original position and size.
4. Return the resulting output sequence, ensuring it has the same length as the input sequence.",

"input": [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence contains three objects of color 3, located at positions 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12. They have a size of 3 units each.",
"transformed_objects": "The objects should be transformed as follows:

* Object 1: Move 2 units to the right (new position: 6-8), scale up by a factor of 2, and change color to 8.
* Object 2: Remove the entire object (positions 7-9).
* Object 3: Scale up by a factor of 2, and change color to 8.
* Add a new object of color 8 at position 13-15.",
"output": [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0],
