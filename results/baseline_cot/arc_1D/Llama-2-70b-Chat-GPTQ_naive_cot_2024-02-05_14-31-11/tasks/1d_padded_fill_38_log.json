The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

The task is to transform the input sequence into an output sequence using a set of predefined rules.\n\nThe rules for this task are as follows:\n\n1. Move: If there are two adjacent pixels of the same color, move the second pixel to the end of the sequence.\n2. Hollow: If there are three adjacent pixels of the same color, remove the middle pixel.\n3. Scale: If there are four adjacent pixels of the same color, replace them with three pixels of the same color.\n4. Remove: If there are five adjacent pixels of the same color, remove the last two pixels.\n5. Copy: If there are six adjacent pixels of the same color, copy the first three pixels and append them to the end of the sequence.\n6. Recolor: If there are seven adjacent pixels of the same color, change the color of the first three pixels to a random value between 1 and 9.\n7. Noise pixels: If there are eight adjacent pixels of the same color, add a random noise pixel with a value between 1 and 9 at a random position in the sequence.\n8. Arithmetic operations: Perform arithmetic operations (such as counting, sorting) on the objects in the sequence.\n9. Conditional rules: Apply rules conditionally based on the properties of the objects in the sequence.\n\nThe goal is to apply these rules in a way that transforms the input sequence into the output sequence while maintaining the same number of pixels.\n\nOverall pattern:\nThe overall pattern in the input-output pairs provided is that the output sequence has the same number of pixels as the input sequence, and the pixels are transformed according to the predefined rules. The rules are applied in a specific order to achieve the desired transformation.\n\nInstructions:\nTo transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the output sequence with the same number of pixels as the input sequence.\n2. Apply the predefined rules in the following order: move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor, noise pixels, and arithmetic operations.\n3. Check if any conditions are met, and apply the corresponding rules.\n4. Return the resulting output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nExplanation:\nThe input sequence has 19 pixels, so the output sequence will also have 19 pixels. The rules are applied in the following order:\n\n1. Move: There are no pairs of adjacent pixels of the same color, so no moves are made.\n2. Hollow: There are no sets of three adjacent pixels of the same color, so no holes are created.\n3. Scale: There are no sets of four adjacent pixels of the same color, so no scaling occurs.\n4. Remove: There are no sets of five adjacent pixels of the same color, so nothing is removed.\n5. Copy: There are no sets of six adjacent pixels of the same color, so nothing is copied.\n6. Recolor: There are no sets of seven adjacent pixels of the same color, so no recoloring occurs.\n7. Noise pixels: There are no sets of eight adjacent pixels of the same color, so no noise pixels are added.\n8. Arithmetic operations: None applicable.\n9. Conditional rules: None applicable.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence."
