prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"description": {
"Example_1": "The input sequence has three objects of color 7, separated by two noise pixels (0) each. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 7 at the beginning and end, and the middle object is shifted by one pixel to the right.",
"Example_2": "The input sequence has four objects of color 9, separated by three noise pixels (0) each. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 9 at the beginning and end, and the second and fourth objects are shifted by one pixel to the left and right, respectively.",
"Example_3": "The input sequence has five objects of color 5, separated by four noise pixels (0) each. The output sequence is similar, but with an additional object of color 5 at the beginning and end, and the third object is shifted by one pixel to the right."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to follow a pattern of adding objects at the beginning and end of the sequence, shifting certain objects by one pixel, and removing some noise pixels. The number of objects and their colors remain constant across inputs and outputs.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

1. Add an object of the same color as the first object in the input sequence at the beginning of the output sequence.
2. Shift the second object in the input sequence by one pixel to the right if it is not already at the end of the sequence.
3. Add an object of the same color as the last object in the input sequence at the end of the output sequence.
4. Remove any noise pixels (0) that appear between objects in the input sequence.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for every pair of adjacent objects in the input sequence that have the same color.",
"transformation": {
"input": [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
"object_description": "The input sequence has three objects of color 9, separated by two noise pixels (0) each. The first and last objects are at the edges of the sequence, while the middle object is shifted by one pixel to the right.",
"transformed_objects": "The output sequence should have three objects of color 9, with the first and last objects at the edges of the sequence, and the middle object shifted by one pixel to the left. There should be no noise pixels in the output sequence.",
"output": [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}

Note: The input sequence has a total of nine pixels, so the output sequence should also have nine pixels.
