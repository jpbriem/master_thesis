prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    # Transformations
    # TODO: Implement the necessary transformations here.
    # Use the functions provided in utilities.py if applicable.
    # If you need additional functionality, implement it yourself.
    # Make sure to return the correct number of outputs (see below).
    # Note: You can also define helper functions outside of this function.
    #       In this case, make sure to add them to the file.
    #       Also note that you cannot access global variables defined in other files.
    #       To pass information between files, e.g., parameters or results,
    #       use argument passing (i.e., function inputs and outputs).
    #       Alternatively, you could write the information to disk and load it in another file.
    #       This is especially useful when dealing with large amounts of data.

    #       Further info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled
    #       Hint: It might be helpful to store intermediate results to disk and continue working on a sample-by-sample basis.
    #           This way, you do not have to keep everything in memory at once.
    #           However, please note that you still have to return one result per sample at the end.
    #           E.g., if you want to save an image, you could use the following commands:
    #               img = Image.open(...)
    #               img.save('image.png')
    #           Loading would then work as follows:
    #               img = Image.open('image.png')
    #           Please adapt the filenames to your needs.
    #           If you encounter errors (especially PermissionError: [Errno 13]...), try running the script as superuser (sudo).
    #           Alternatively, you can change the permissions / ownership of the folder manually:
    #               chmod -R 777 path/to/folder   # adjust permissions
    #               chown -R $USER:$GROUPS path/to/folder   # take ownership
    #           Hint^2: If you run multiple scripts sequentially that depend on each other,
    #                   make sure to call each script with the --reset-folder flag.
    #                   Otherwise, you will get a RuntimeError: Unable to create file...
    #                   when trying to overwrite existing files.
