            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\n\n'''\n#%%\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport sys\nsys.path.append(os.getcwd())\nfrom utilities import *\n\ndef get_data():\n    '''\n    This function loads the data set and returns it.\n    \n    Returns:\n        df (pandas dataframe): Dataframe containing the training data.\n        \n    '''\n    # Load data\n    df = pd.read_csv('../input/task_5_training_set.csv')\n    return df\n\ndef get_labels(df):\n    '''\n    This function extracts the labels from the data frame and returns them.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        df (pandas dataframe): Dataframe containing the training data.\n    \n    Returns:\n        y (list): List containing the labels.\n        \n    '''\n    # Extract labels\n    y = []\n    for i in range(len(df)):\n        if len(df['Input'][i]) == 8:\n            y.append([0]*6 + [1]*2)\n        elif len(df['Input'][i]) == 9:\n            y.append([0]*7 + [1]*2)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Unexpected number of elements.\")\n    return y\n\ndef get_features(df):\n    '''\n    This function extracts the features from the data frame and returns them.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        df (pandas dataframe): Dataframe containing the training data.\n    \n    Returns:\n        X (numpy array): Array containing the features.\n        \n    '''\n    # Extract features\n    X = []\n    for i in range(len(df)):\n        x = []\n        for j in range(len(df['Input'][i])):\n            x.extend(np.array(df['Input'][i][j]).tolist()*2)\n        X.append(x)\n    return X\n\ndef get_test_case(X):\n    '''\n    This function creates a test case using the given feature matrix.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        X (numpy array): Array containing the features.\n    \n    Returns:\n        test_case (dict): Dictionary containing the test case.\n        \n    '''\n    # Create test case\n    test_case = {}\n    test_case['description'] = {'Example_1': 'In this example, the object at index 1 was moved one place to the right.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, the object at index 2 was moved two places to the left.'}\n    test_case['overall_pattern'] = 'Objects can be moved around.'\n    test_case['instructions'] = 'Move an object to another location.'\n    test_case['transformation']['input'] = [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    test_case['transformation']['object_description'] = 'There is one object starting at index 2 with a size of 6.'\n    test_case['transformation']['transformed_objects'] = 'The object starts at index 1 with a size of 6.'\n    test_case['transformation']['output'] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n    test_case['test_output'] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n    return test_case\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print('\\nTask 5\\n')\n    # Get data\n    df = get_data()\n    X = get_features(df)\n    y = get_labels(df)\n    # Split data\n    train_size = int(.8*len(y))\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=int((.2)*len(y)), random_state=42)\n    # Fit model\n    scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_train)\n    X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)\n    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)\n    clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5).fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\n    # Predict test cases\n    pred = clf.predict(X_test_scaled)\n    correct = sum(pred==y_test)/float(len(y_test))\n    print('Accuracy: {:.2%}\\n'.format(correct))\n    # Evaluate predictions\n    for i in range(len(y_test)):\n        print('Prediction: ', end='')\n        print(pred[i], '\\tActual label: ', end='')\n        print(y_test[i])\n    # Generate test case\n    test_case = get_test_case(X)"
