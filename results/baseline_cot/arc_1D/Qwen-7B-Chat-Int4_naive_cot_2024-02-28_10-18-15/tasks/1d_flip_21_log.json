            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern:\nThe input-output pairs follow a simple transformation pattern where adjacent pixels of the same color represent an object, and objects can be moved, scaled, copied, recolored, removed, or combined using certain operations. The input sequence consists of 1-dimensional arrays of integers ranging from 1 to 9 representing pixel colors, with 0 representing the background color. The output sequence also consists of 1-dimensional arrays of integers, but the order and arrangement of objects may differ from the input sequence.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the necessary operations to create the desired output sequence. Here are the steps we can take:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. We can do this by looking for adjacent pixels of the same color.\n  2. Determine the properties of each object, including its color, position, size, and any other relevant information.\n  3. Apply the appropriate operation(s) to each object to transform it into its desired form. This could include moving, scaling, copying, recoloring, removing, or combining objects.\n  4. Combine the transformed objects to create the final output sequence.\n\nFor example, let's consider Example_1. In this input sequence, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 1, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2, and Object_2 with color 1, starting at index 4 and ending at index 4, both having a size of 2. To transform this input sequence into its output sequence, we can move Object_1 one pixel to the right and combine it with Object_2 to create a single object with color 1, starting at index 2 and ending at index 5, with a size of 3. The output sequence would then be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTransformed Objects: [Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 2, end_index: 5, size: 3}]\nInstructions: Move Object_1 one pixel to the right and combine it with Object_2 to create a single object with color 1, starting at index 2 and ending at index 5, with a size of 3. Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTransformed Objects: [Object_1: {color: 5, start_index: 2, end_index: 5, size: 3}]\nInstructions: Scale Object_1 down by half and combine it with Object_2 to create a single object with color 5, starting at index 2 and ending at index 5, with a size of 3. Output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTransformed Objects: []\nInstructions: Remove all objects from the input sequence. Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTest Output:\n```css\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```"
