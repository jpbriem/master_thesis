            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has 17 objects of color 8 and one object of color 3.

In the output sequence, all objects of color 8 are moved to the right side of the sequence, and the single object of color 3 remains unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has 15 objects of color 4 and two objects of color 0.

An input sequence is transformed into an output sequence by moving, removing, or copying objects according to specific rules. These rules may include conditions and/or arithmetical operations involving the objects and their positions. The remaining pixels (i.e., those not belonging to any object) are considered noise and remain unchanged in both the input and output sequences.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine how they should be moved, removed, or copied according to the given transformation rules. You can then create the resulting output sequence by applying these rules to the input sequence.
