            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: Each object in the input sequence can be moved horizontally, vertically, or both to create a similar object in the output sequence. The size of each object remains constant.\nInstructions:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n  * Determine the desired location of each object in the output sequence.\n  * Move each object horizontally and/or vertically to match the desired location.\n  * If an object moves out of bounds, it will remain at its current location.\n  * Zero padding may be necessary to ensure the correct length of the output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nObjects Description: There are two objects, one starting at index 1 (with color 6) and ending at index 5 (with color 4), and another starting at index 6 (with color 4) and ending at index 9 (with color 0).\nTransformed Objects: The first object should be shifted left by one position to become object 1 in the output sequence, while the second object should remain unchanged. The third object should be shifted right by one position to become object 2 in the output sequence, while the fourth object should also remain unchanged. The fifth object should be shifted up by one position to become object 3 in the output sequence, while the sixth object should remain unchanged. The seventh object should be shifted down by one position to become object 4 in the output sequence, while the eighth object should remain unchanged. The ninth object should be shifted up by one position to become object 5 in the output sequence, while the tenth object should remain unchanged.\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nNote: This solution assumes that there is no need to insert any new objects or delete existing objects from the input sequence. If this is not the case, additional steps may be required to complete the transformation."
