prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input has two objects, one of which consists of nine consecutive zeros followed by a single object of six consecutive ones. In the output, both objects are present, but their positions and sizes have been altered. Specifically, the zero object has been moved four positions to the right, while the one object has been moved three positions to the left.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input has a single large object consisting of eight consecutive eights, surrounded by many small objects consisting of zeros. In the output, the large object has been split into two separate objects, each consisting of four consecutive eights. The small objects have remained unchanged.' }, 'Overall_pattern': 'In general, the input-output patterns involve transforming input sequences into output sequences through some combination of copying, moving, splitting, and merging objects. The specific details of these transformations depend on the nature of the objects being processed, including their size, shape, position, and color. Additionally, the transformation process may also involve arithmetic operations, such as counting and sorting, depending on the requirements of the problem at hand.', 'Instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to carefully consider the structure and properties of the input sequence, as well as any constraints or requirements that must be satisfied. You can then apply various transformation techniques, such as copying, moving, splitting, and merging objects, to achieve the desired result. It is important to pay close attention to the details of these transformations, especially when it comes to preserving the integrity and consistency of the input and output sequences. Finally, you should verify that the transformed output sequence meets all the necessary criteria and requirements before submitting it for evaluation.' }, 'transformation': { 'input': '[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]', 'object_description': 'The input sequence contains several objects, each represented by a contiguous block of identical pixels. The size of each object varies, ranging from a single pixel to a larger cluster of pixels. The objects are arranged in a specific order, with some objects appearing multiple times and others appearing once or twice.', 'transformed_objects': 'To obtain the desired output sequence, we will need to perform a series of transformation steps. First, we will need to identify the individual objects in the input sequence and determine their exact size and position. Next, we will need to determine the optimal way to rearrange these objects to create the desired output sequence. This may involve copying, moving, or merging objects, depending on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. Finally, we will need to ensure that the transformed output sequence meets all the necessary criteria and requirements, such as having the correct number of objects and satisfying any specified constraints or requirements.' }, 'test_output': '[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4]' }
