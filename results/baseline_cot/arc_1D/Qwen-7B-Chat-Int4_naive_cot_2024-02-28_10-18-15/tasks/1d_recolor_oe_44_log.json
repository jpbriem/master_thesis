            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ \"description\": { \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input sequence contains 10 identical pixels in column 1 and 5 identical pixels in column 8. In the output sequence, these pixels are replaced by 9s in column 1 and 6s in column 8.\", \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, the input sequence contains 10 identical pixels in column 1 and 5 identical pixels in column 8. In the output sequence, these pixels are replaced by 9s in column 1 and 6s in column 8.\" }, \"overall_pattern\": \"The overall pattern in these examples is to replace specific pixels in the input sequence with their corresponding value from another location in the sequence (or a new value). This can be done using any combination of object operations, such as copy, recolor, move, hollow, etc., depending on the desired outcome. Additionally, the pattern involves replacing a set number of pixels at once, rather than individual pixels one by one.\", \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n\n  * Identify the specific pixels that need to be replaced in the input sequence.\n  * Determine the location(s) where these pixels will be replaced in the output sequence.\n  * Choose an appropriate operation to perform on the selected pixels, such as copy, recolor, move, hollow, etc.\n  * Apply the chosen operation to the selected pixels, updating the output sequence accordingly.\n  * Repeat this process until all of the necessary changes have been made.\n\nNote that the order in which these steps are performed may vary depending on the specifics of the input and output sequences, as well as the desired outcome. However, the general idea is to identify the relevant elements of the input sequence, determine their desired properties in the output sequence, and then apply the appropriate operations to achieve those properties.\", \"transformation\": {\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\", \"object_description\": \"Regarding the test input, there are two sets of identical pixels: a group of 10 pixels in column 1 and a group of 5 pixels in column 8.
