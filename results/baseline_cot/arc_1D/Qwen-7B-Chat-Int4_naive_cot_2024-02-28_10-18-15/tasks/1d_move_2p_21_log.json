            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, we see that each object has been removed from the input sequence. Specifically, two objects were removed, one at index 2 and another at index 8.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, we see that an object was added to the input sequence. Specifically, a new object was inserted at index 2, with the value 5.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, we see that all objects were copied from the input sequence to the output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each example, there is a clear transformation pattern that can be inferred from the input and output sequences. In general, the transformation involves removing, adding, or copying objects from the input sequence to create the output sequence. Each object has a specific location and size, and these properties are preserved during the transformation process.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to follow the steps below:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence. You can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each unique value (excluding the background color) and identifying any regions where consecutive values repeat multiple times.\n  * Determine which objects need to be removed, added, or copied to create the desired output sequence. This will depend on the specific requirements of the problem.\n  * Apply the appropriate transformation operations to the input sequence to create the output sequence. For example, if you want to remove an object, you can simply delete its corresponding elements from the sequence. If you want to add an object, you can insert it at a specified location in the sequence using the `numpy.insert()` function. If you want to copy an object, you can slice the input sequence to include the object and then concatenate it with itself at the desired location using the `numpy.concatenate()` function.\n\nOnce you have applied the appropriate transformation operations to the input sequence, you can generate the output sequence using the `numpy.array()` function.\n\nNote that the specific details of the transformation operations may vary depending on the problem at hand, so it is important to carefully consider the requirements before applying any transformations.'}, 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the test case:', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence by counting the number of occurrences of each unique value (excluding the background color) and identifying any regions where consecutive values repeat multiple times.', 'transformed_objects': 'Remove or add objects as necessary to create the desired output sequence.
