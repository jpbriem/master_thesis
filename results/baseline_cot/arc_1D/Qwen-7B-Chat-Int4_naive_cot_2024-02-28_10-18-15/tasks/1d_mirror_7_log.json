            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: In this task, we need to transform an input sequence of pixels into an output sequence. Each object in the input sequence is represented by a consecutive group of pixels of the same color. We can perform various operations on these objects, including moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc. Additionally, there may be noise pixels in the input sequence. The transformation process involves identifying objects in the input sequence, performing the necessary operations on them, and generating the corresponding output sequence.\nInstructions: To transform a new input into its output, we need to follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify objects in the input sequence: Find groups of adjacent pixels of the same color and mark them as objects.\n  2. Perform operations on objects: Depending on the required operation, we can perform one or more of the following actions:\n    * Move: Shift an object along a specified direction.\n    * Scale: Resize an object while preserving its aspect ratio.\n    * Remove: Delete an object completely.\n    * Copy: Duplicate an object at a specific location.\n    * Recolor: Change the color of an object.\n  3. Generate the output sequence: Combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence, ensuring that no two objects overlap or contain each other.\n\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nDescription: There are three objects in the input sequence:\n- Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 5}\n- Object_2: {color: 1, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 3}\n- Object_3: {color: 9, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 4}\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nDescription: After transforming the input sequence, we get the following objects:\n- Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 5}\n- Object_2: {color: 1, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 3}\n- Object_3: {color: 9, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 4}\n\nNote that the noise pixels (i.e., 0s) have been removed, and the objects have been aligned properly.\nTest Output:\n```python\n[[0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nExplanation: The above code generates the output sequence using Python's `numpy` library. It creates a 1D array with the desired dimensions and fills it with zeros. Then, it iterates over the input sequence and checks if any non-zero pixel value exists. If so, it sets the corresponding element in the output sequence to the corresponding pixel value from the input sequence. Finally, it returns the generated output sequence."
