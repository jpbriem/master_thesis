prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has one object, represented by the color 6. This object occupies the entire sequence. The output sequence has two objects, both of which occupy the entire sequence and have the same color (6). In this way, the input sequence was transformed into two identical copies of itself.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence has one object, represented by the color 6. This object occupies the entire sequence except for the last two elements. The output sequence also has one object, which occupies the entire sequence except for the last two elements and has the same color (6). In this way, the input sequence was transformed into a smaller version of itself, removing the last two elements.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence has one object, represented by the color 3. This object occupies half of the sequence. The output sequence also has one object, which occupies half of the sequence and has the same color (3). In this way, the input sequence was transformed into a smaller version of itself, removing half of the sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All three examples demonstrate the transformation pattern of copying an object or part of it. Specifically, each example shows a transformation where the original object or part of it is copied onto a new location or resized to a new size. Additionally, all three examples show that the color of the copied object remains the same as the original.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

  * Identify any objects in the input sequence.
  * Determine their sizes and positions relative to each other.
  * Decide whether you want to copy the objects verbatim or make changes to them.
  * If making changes, decide what kind of change to make and where to make it.
  * Apply the change to the object(s) in the input sequence.
  * Repeat until no more changes need to be made.

For example, if you wanted to create two identical copies of an object in the input sequence, you would:

  * Identify the object in question.
  * Create a new empty space in the output sequence where the object will be placed.
  * Copy the object from the input sequence to the new empty space.
  * Repeat this process for a second time, creating another copy of the object in a separate empty space.

Once you have applied all necessary transformations to the input sequence, you will have produced its corresponding output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}
```css
import numpy as np

def transform(input_seq):
    # Identify objects in the input sequence
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        if input_seq[i] != 0:
            objects.append({'start_index': i, 'end_index': i + 1, 'size': 1, 'color': input_seq[i]})
    
    # Determine sizes and positions of objects relative to each other
    positions = {}
    for obj in objects:
        pos = obj['start_index']
        while pos < len(input_seq) and input_seq[pos] == obj['color']:
            pos += 1
        positions[obj['color']] = {'start_pos': pos, 'end_pos': pos + obj['size'] - 1}
    
    # Make copies of objects or modify them
    output_seq = np.copy(input_seq)
    for obj in objects:
        start_pos = positions[obj['color']]['start_pos']
        end_pos = positions[obj['color']]['end_pos']
        if obj['size'] > 1:
            output_seq[start_pos:end_pos+1] = obj['color']
        else:
            output_seq[start_pos:end_pos] = obj['color']

    return output_seq
```

Note that this function assumes that the input sequence contains only non-zero integers. If there are non-integer values in the input sequence, they will need to be filtered out before calling the `transform` function.
