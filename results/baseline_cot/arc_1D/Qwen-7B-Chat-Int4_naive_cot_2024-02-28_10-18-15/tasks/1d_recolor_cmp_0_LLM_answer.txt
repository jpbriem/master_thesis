prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern: In each example, there is an object of size 8 that contains 4 objects of size 2, arranged in a repeating pattern of two rows of four objects. Each object has a specific starting index (0-based) and ending index (0-based), and their positions relative to each other follow a specific order. Additionally, the input sequence always starts with a single object of size 0, followed by a group of eight objects of size 2.
Instructions: To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to perform several steps:

  1. Identify the object of size 8 that contains the 4 objects of size 2. This can be done by looking at the input sequence and finding the largest object that is surrounded by smaller objects.
  2. Move the identified object to the beginning of the input sequence, so it becomes the first element of the output sequence.
  3. Remove the remaining objects of size 2 from the input sequence, leaving only the object of size 8.
  4. Recolor the object of size 8 to match the desired output sequence.

To create the final output sequence, we simply concatenate the moved and resized object with the rest of the original input sequence.
Transformation: Input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], Output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]. We identify the object of size 8 by looking for the largest object surrounded by smaller objects. In this case, the object of size 8 starts at index 0 and ends at index 7. We then move this object to the beginning of the input sequence, so it becomes the first element of the output sequence. After removing the remaining objects of size 2, we are left with the object of size 8. Finally, we recolor the object of size 8 to match the desired output sequence.
Test Output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0].
