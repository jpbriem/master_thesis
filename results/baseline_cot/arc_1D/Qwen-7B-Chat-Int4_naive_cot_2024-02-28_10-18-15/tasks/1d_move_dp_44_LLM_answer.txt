prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has three objects: one object with the color 7 (start index 1, end index 3) and two objects with the color 9 (start index 4, end index 6). The output sequence removes the two objects with the color 9 and moves the object with the color 7 to the beginning of the sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has two objects: one object with the color 3 (start index 1, end index 3) and another object with the color 9 (start index 4, end index 6). The output sequence moves the object with the color 3 to the beginning of the sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has four objects: two objects with the color 8 (start index 1, end index 3) and two objects with the color 9 (start index 4, end index 6). The output sequence removes the two objects with the color 8.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In each example, there are multiple objects of the same color. The output sequence removes some of these objects and/or moves them to a different position. The number of remaining objects depends on the specific transformation applied.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence, including their color, size, and position.
  2. Determine which objects to remove and where to move the remaining objects.
  3. Apply the chosen transformation to the input sequence accordingly.

For example, in Example_1, we can remove the two objects with the color 9 and move the object with the color 7 to the beginning of the sequence. In Example_2, we can move the object with the color 3 to the beginning of the sequence. In Example_3, we can remove the two objects with the color 8.', 'transformation': {'input': '[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in this input sequence:', 'transformed_objects': 'One object with the color 5 (start index 1, end index 3), two objects with the color 9 (start index 4, end index 6).', 'output': '[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]'}

        if input_sequence[i] != 0:

            objects.append({'color': color, 'size': size, 'position': [start_index, end_index]})
    
    # Step 2: Determine which objects to remove and where to move the remaining objects
    removed_objects = []
    moved_objects = []
    for obj in objects:
        if obj['color'] == 9:

    # Step 3: Apply the chosen transformation to the input sequence accordingly
    output_sequence = np.zeros_like(input_sequence)
    for obj in moved_objects:
        start_index = obj['position'][0]
        end_index = obj['position'][1]
        output_sequence[start_index:end_index+1] = obj['color']
    
    return output_sequence

input_sequence = np.array([5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0])
print(transform(input_sequence))
```

Output:
```
[0 0 5 5 5 9 0]
