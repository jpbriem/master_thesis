prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, we see that there are two groups of identical objects. The first group has eight objects, each object being two pixels wide and two pixels high. The second group has one object, which is four pixels wide and four pixels high.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, we again see two groups of identical objects. However, this time the first group has five objects, each object being four pixels wide and four pixels high. The second group has one object, which is five pixels wide and five pixels high.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, we see one object consisting of nine pixels, which is four pixels wide and four pixels high.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern here is that there are multiple groups of identical objects, each group having a specific number of objects of varying sizes. Each object has a constant width and height, and the total number of objects is always equal to the sum of the individual object counts in each group.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the groups of identical objects present in the input sequence and create corresponding groups of identical objects in the output sequence. You can do this by counting the number of objects in each group and creating new objects accordingly. The size and position of the objects in both the input and output sequences must match exactly. In addition, any noise pixels in the input sequence must also be included in the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided:', 'object_description': 'Identify the groups of identical objects present in the input sequence:', 'transformed_objects': 'Create corresponding groups of identical objects in the output sequence:', 'output': 'Copy the output sequence provided:'}, 'test_output': 'numpy.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])'}`

In order to transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to follow these steps:

  * Identify the groups of identical objects present in the input sequence. In this case, we can see that there are three groups of identical objects:

        0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    2    8    8    8    8    8    8    8    8    8    0    0    0    0    0
    
    We can see that the first group consists of eight objects, each object being two pixels wide and two pixels high. The second group consists of five objects, each object being four pixels wide and four pixels high. And the third group consists of one object, which is four pixels wide and four pixels high.
  * Create corresponding groups of identical objects in the output sequence. Since the input sequence consists of eight objects, we can create an output sequence consisting of eight objects, each object being two pixels wide and two pixels high. Similarly, since the input sequence consists of five objects, we can create an output sequence consisting of five objects, each object being four pixels wide and four pixels high. Finally, since the input sequence consists of one object, we can create an output sequence consisting of one object, which is four pixels wide and four pixels high.
  * Copy the output sequence provided: [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]

Therefore, the final output sequence will be:

[[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]
