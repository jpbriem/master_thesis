prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has no object, but it contains two noise pixels at indices 1 and 2. In the output sequence, there is one object that consists of four pixels (indices 1-4).'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that each input pixel can either be a noise pixel or part of an object. If a pixel is part of an object, then it will remain unchanged in the output sequence. Otherwise, it will become a noise pixel.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to identify any objects in the input sequence and create new objects if necessary. We also need to identify any noise pixels and keep them unchanged in the output sequence. Finally, we need to make sure that the output sequence has the correct number of pixels and that they match the specified patterns.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there are two noise pixels at indices 1 and 2. There is also one object that consists of four pixels (indices 1-4).'}, 'test_output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}
```css
import numpy as np

# Input sequence
input_seq = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

# Identify objects in input sequence
objects = []
for i in range(len(input_seq)):
    if input_seq[i] == 0:
        # Noise pixel
        pass
    elif input_seq[i:i+4].sum() == 8:
        # Object
        objects.append({'color': input_seq[i], 'start_index': i, 'end_index': i+3})

# Create output sequence
output_seq = np.copy(input_seq)
for obj in objects:
    # Copy object
    output_seq[obj['start_index']:obj['end_index']] = obj['color']
    
# Check if output sequence has correct number of pixels and matches specified patterns
assert len(output_seq) == len(input_seq), f"Output sequence must have exactly the same length as input sequence."
```

Note: This code assumes that the specified patterns match the conditions provided in the instructions. It does not check for these conditions.
