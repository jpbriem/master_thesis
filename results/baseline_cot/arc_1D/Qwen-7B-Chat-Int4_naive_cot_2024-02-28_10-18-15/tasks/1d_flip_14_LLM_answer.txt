prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains many zeros, which represent the background color. There are also some ones, which represent objects.

In the output sequence, this object is moved one position to the left and its size is reduced to half. It is now surrounded by four zeros, indicating that it was copied twice and then hollowed out.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has one object, represented by the number eight. In the output sequence, this object is moved one position to the right and its size is increased to double. It is now surrounded by five zeros, indicating that it was copied three times and then scaled up.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All input-output pairs follow the same transformation pattern: they take an input sequence and produce an output sequence where all zeros are replaced by ones, except for the last two zeros at the end of the sequence. Additionally, any objects present in the input sequence will be modified according to the specified rules:', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output, you need to apply the following steps:', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task.

You can assume that there is always at least one object present.', 'transformed_objects': 'For each transformed object, determine its new size, position, and color. Apply the appropriate transformation rule (move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor) to modify it accordingly. Note that you may need to make adjustments if the transformation would result in an invalid object (e.g., a hollow object without a center).', 'output': 'Create the resulting output sequence by replacing all zeros with ones, except for the last two zeros at the end of the sequence. Place the transformed objects in their new positions according to their sizes and positions. If necessary, adjust the positions of other objects to accommodate the transformed objects. Finally, add any additional noise pixels to complete the output sequence.'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}}
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_sequence):
    # Step 1: Replace all zeros with ones
    output_sequence = np.where(input_sequence == 0, 1, input_sequence)
    
    # Step 2: Remove the last two zeros
    output_sequence = output_sequence[:-2]
    
    return output_sequence

# Test case
input_sequence = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
output_sequence = transform(input_sequence)

print(output_sequence)
```

Output:

```
