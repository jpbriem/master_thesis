            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 5]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern:\nThe overall pattern for these examples can be inferred as:\n\n- Each input sequence contains a set of pixels represented by integers from 1 to 9 (inclusive), where 0 represents the background color.\n-\u76f8\u90bb pixels of the same color are considered as an object.\n- Each object has a specified color, size, and position.\n- The output sequence consists of modified versions of the input sequence, where each object's position, size, and color may change.\n\nInstructions:\nTo transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects present in the input sequence.\n  2. Determine their positions, sizes, and colors.\n  3. Modify the positions, sizes, and colors of the objects in the output sequence according to the transformation patterns provided in the examples.\n\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nDescription of Input-Output Relations:\nIn Example_1, the input sequence has six objects, each with a different color and position. In the output sequence, three objects remain, but their positions and sizes have been altered. Specifically, two objects have moved closer together, one object has grown larger, and one object has shrunk in size.\nIn Example_2, the input sequence has four objects, each with a different color and position. In the output sequence, two objects have merged, forming a single object with a combined color and size. Additionally, another object has moved closer to the previously merged object.\nIn Example_3, the input sequence has eight objects, each with a different color and position. In the output sequence, five objects have moved closer together, two objects have merged, and one object has disappeared entirely.\n\nOverall Description:\nThese examples demonstrate a simple transformation pattern that involves modifying the positions, sizes, and colors of objects in the input sequence to create the corresponding output sequence. The exact transformation patterns depend on the specific input sequence, but they generally involve identifying objects, determining their properties, and altering those properties to produce the desired output sequence."
