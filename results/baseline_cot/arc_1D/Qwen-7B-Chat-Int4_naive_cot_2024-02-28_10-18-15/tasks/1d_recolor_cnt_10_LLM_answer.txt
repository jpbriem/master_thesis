prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:

  * Example_1 shows an object moving from one location to another. Specifically, the object at index 1 moves from index 5 to index 7. This movement causes a change in the order of the other objects in the sequence.
  * Example_2 shows an object being removed from the sequence. Specifically, the object at index 5 is removed from the sequence, causing a change in the order of the other objects in the sequence.
  * Example_3 shows an object being copied and pasted multiple times. Specifically, the object at index 1 is copied four times and pasted at indices 6, 7, 8, and 9. This action causes a change in the number of occurrences of each object in the sequence.

Overall Pattern:

  * In all three examples, there is a single object being acted upon in some way (moving, removing, copying), which results in a change in the order of the other objects in the sequence.
  * The transformation can be represented mathematically using operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Instructions:

  * To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:
    1. Identify the object(s) in the input sequence that need to be acted upon.
    2. Determine the type of action to be taken on the identified object(s).
    3. Apply the chosen action to the identified object(s) and observe the changes made to the sequence.
    4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 until no further changes are observed.
  * For example, if the input sequence contains two objects of color 6 at indices 1 and 5, and we want to move the second object to index 3, we would apply the following actions:
    1. Identify the object(s) to be moved: object at index 5
    2. Determine the type of action to be taken: move
    3. Apply the move action: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 until no further changes are observed.

Transformation:

  * Input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Output: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test Output:

  * [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
