prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence contains many copies of the number 5, which represent the background color. The output sequence has no copies of the number 5 and instead contains two copies of the number 2, which represent a different object.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence contains one copy of the number 0, which represents the background color, and several copies of the number 1, which represent an object. The output sequence has one copy of the number 0 and several copies of the number 1, but the positions of the objects have been changed.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'In both examples, the input sequence contains objects represented by numbers other than 0. The output sequence removes or changes these objects according to some transformation rule.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to determine what kind of transformation rule is being applied. In this case, it appears that the transformation rule involves removing or changing objects. To do so, you can identify the objects in the input sequence and then apply the appropriate transformation to each object. For example, if an object consists of multiple consecutive copies of the same number, you could delete those copies. If an object consists of a single number surrounded by zeros, you could replace the single number with another number or delete the zeros surrounding it. Once you have identified and applied the necessary transformations to each object, you will obtain the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'In the input sequence, there are objects represented by numbers other than 0. These objects consist of either a single number surrounded by zeros or multiple consecutive copies of the same number. To create the output sequence, you need to determine the type of object and apply the appropriate transformation to it.', 'transformed_objects': 'For example, if an object consists of a single number surrounded by zeros, you could replace the single number with another number or delete the zeros surrounding it. If an object consists of multiple consecutive copies of the same number, you could delete those copies. You may also want to consider whether any of the objects are adjacent to each other and whether they are aligned properly. Finally, you may want to check whether any of the objects contain noise pixels.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'numpy.array([4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2])' }
