prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": { "Example_1": "In Example 1, the input sequence contains 8 objects of color 0 (background) and one object of color 5. The output sequence has no objects but still preserves the structure of the input sequence.", "Example_2": "In Example 2, the input sequence contains two objects of color 3 and the output sequence contains two copies of these objects arranged side by side." }, " overall_pattern": "All input-output pairs follow the same transformation pattern where the input sequence is split into several smaller parts, each part containing only one type of object. Each object can either be removed or copied, preserving the structure of the input sequence. If an object is removed, it will result in a gap in the output sequence. If an object is copied, it will appear twice in the output sequence, aligned side by side." , " instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their properties. If an object is present in both the input and output sequence, then it needs to be preserved in the output sequence. If an object is missing in the output sequence, then it needs to be added back. You also need to consider the placement of the objects in the output sequence, making sure they align correctly with the corresponding objects in the input sequence. Finally, you need to make sure the output sequence is of the correct length." , "transformation": { "input": "[7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]", "object_description": "The input sequence consists of 8 objects of color 0 (background) and one object of color 7. These objects are arranged in a grid-like structure.", "transformed_objects": "The output sequence should contain exactly the same number and types of objects as the input sequence. However, some of the objects may be moved or duplicated. Specifically, there should be 8 objects of color 0 and one object of color 7 in the output sequence. Additionally, the object of color 7 should be placed at the center of the output sequence, while the other objects should be arranged symmetrically around it. Finally, any gaps in the output sequence caused by removing objects should be filled with copies of the original objects." , "output": "[7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]" } , "test_output": "array([7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])" }

Note: This answer uses Python syntax and assumes that the input and output sequences are represented as lists of integers.
