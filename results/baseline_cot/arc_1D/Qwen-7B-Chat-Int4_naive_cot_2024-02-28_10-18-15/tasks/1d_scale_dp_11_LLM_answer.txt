prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:

  * Example_1: The input sequence contains only zeros except for one object at index 1, which has a value of 8. This object covers the entire sequence and has no neighbors. The output sequence also contains only zeros except for two objects at indices 1 and 9, where the second object has a value of 9. Both objects cover the entire sequence and have no neighbors.
  * Example_2: The input sequence contains four objects of color 3. Two of these objects are located at indices 1 and 6, while the other two are located at indices 2 and 7. The output sequence also contains four objects of color 3, but they are now arranged differently. Specifically, the object at index 1 is moved to index 6, the object at index 2 is moved to index 7, and the object at index 6 is moved to index 2. The object at index 9 remains unchanged.
  * Example_3: The input sequence contains three objects of color 7, and an additional object of color 9 at the end. The output sequence also contains three objects of color 7, but their positions have been changed. Specifically, the object at index 1 is moved to index 4, the object at index 2 is moved to index 5, and the object at index 3 is moved to index 6. The object at index 9 remains unchanged.

Overall Pattern:

  * In each example, there is one or more objects in the input sequence, and their positions are changed in the output sequence. The number of objects and their initial positions do not change from example to example.

Instructions:

  * To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, you need to move objects around.
  * Start by identifying the objects in the input sequence using the `object_description` field.
  * Then, identify the desired positions for the objects in the output sequence using the `transformed_objects` field.
  * Finally, create the output sequence by moving the objects according to the desired positions.

Transformation:

  * Input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]
  * Object Description: There is one object at index 1 with a value of 5.
  * Transformed Objects: Move object at index 1 to index 9.
  * Output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0]

Test Output:

  * numpy.array([5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0])
