prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": {"Example_1": "In Example_1, there are no changes in the input sequence compared to the output sequence. The objects remain unchanged in terms of their position, size, and color.", "Example_2": "In Example_2, one object has been removed (the 0th element). This caused the other objects to shift to the right by one position. Additionally, two objects were copied from the original sequence to the beginning of the output sequence." }, "overall_pattern": "Both Examples follow a pattern where an object can be removed or added at any position. When an object is removed, the remaining objects will shift to fill the gap left by the removed object. When an object is added, it will appear at the front of the output sequence.", "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, identify the positions of the objects in the input sequence. If an object is present at a given position, check if it needs to be removed or added. If it needs to be removed, adjust the positions of the other objects accordingly. If it needs to be added, insert it at the front of the output sequence. Repeat this process for each object in the input sequence until you have produced the desired output sequence." , "transformation": {"input": "[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2]", "object_description": "There are seven objects in this input sequence. Each object is represented by a single number and spans across multiple indices. The first object starts at index 0 and ends at index 6. The second object starts at index 7 and ends at index 12. The third object starts at index 13 and ends at index 18. The fourth object starts at index 19 and ends at index 24. The fifth object starts at index 25 and ends at index 30. The sixth object starts at index 31 and ends at index 36. The seventh object starts at index 37 and ends at index 42. The eighth object starts at index 43 and ends at index 47. The ninth object starts at index 48 and ends at index 52. The tenth object starts at index 53 and ends at index 57. The eleventh object starts at index 58 and ends at index 62. The twelfth object starts at index 63 and ends at index 67. The thirteenth object starts at index 68 and ends at index 72. The fourteenth object starts at index 73 and ends at index 77. The fifteenth object starts at index 78 and ends at index 82. The sixteenth object starts at index 83 and ends at index 87. The seventeenth object starts at index 88 and ends at index 92. The eighteenth object starts at index 93 and ends at index 97.

However, since the first object is missing, the other objects need to shift to fill the gap left by the removed object. Therefore, the output sequence should be [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2].", "output": "[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2]" }, "test_output": "[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2]" }
