            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence contains many occurrences of the number 3, which are replaced by the number 0 in the output sequence. This indicates that there is a rule that replaces any occurrence of 3 with 0.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence contains two adjacent blocks of 2s, which are horizontally aligned and connected in the output sequence. This indicates that there is a rule that aligns and connects adjacent blocks of the same color.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence contains an object consisting of 5 consecutive pixels of the same color (5), which is removed in the output sequence. This indicates that there is a rule that removes objects of a certain size.', 'Overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern shared by these examples is that each input sequence has a corresponding output sequence where some objects are transformed, rearranged, or removed according to certain rules.', 'Instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation rules to them. You can do this by looking at the object descriptions provided above and applying the relevant transformation actions accordingly. Be sure to pay attention to the sizes, positions, and colors of the objects, and make sure to follow the instructions carefully to get the correct output sequence.', 'Transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task. Make sure it is correctly formatted and has the right length.', 'object_description': 'For each object in the input sequence, describe its properties such as size, position, and color. Use this information to determine what transformation action(s) need to be applied to it.', 'transformed_objects': 'Based on the object descriptions and transformation actions, create a description of how the objects will look in the output sequence. Pay attention to their sizes, positions, and colors, and make sure they match the requirements specified in the transformation instructions.', 'output': 'Create the final output sequence by applying the appropriate transformation actions to each object in the input sequence. Make sure it matches the requirements specified in the transformation instructions.'}, 'Test_output': 'The expected output sequence for the given input is:\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}}\nNote: The transformation instructions are meant to provide guidance on how to approach the problem, but there may be multiple valid ways to solve it. It's up to you to decide which approach works best for you."
