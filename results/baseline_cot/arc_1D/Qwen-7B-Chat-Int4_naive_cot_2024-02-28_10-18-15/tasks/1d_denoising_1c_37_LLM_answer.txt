prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:
The input-output pairs share a common transformation pattern where each object in the input sequence is transformed according to specific rules. In this pattern, the objects can be moved, scaled, recolored, or removed. The transformation also involves conditions, such as checking if two objects are adjacent or overlapping. Additionally, there is noise in the form of random zeros in the input sequence.
Overall Pattern:
Each object in the input sequence is transformed according to specific rules. The transformation involves moving, scaling, recoloring, or removing objects. There are also conditions that check if two objects are adjacent or overlapping. Finally, there is noise in the form of random zeros in the input sequence.
Instructions:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence by counting the number of consecutive occurrences of each color.
  * Move each object by changing its starting index to match its desired position.
  * Scale each object by multiplying its size by a factor of 2 or 0.5.
  * Recolor each object by assigning a new color code to it.
  * Remove any object that does not meet the specified conditions (e.g., adjacent to another object).
  * Add random zeros to the input sequence to create noise.

Transformation:
Input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:

  * Object 1 has an initial size of 3 and a starting index of 1. It is moved to the leftmost position by changing its starting index to 0.
  * Object 2 has an initial size of 3 and a starting index of 6. It is scaled down by half by multiplying its size by 0.5.
  * Object 3 has an initial size of 3 and a starting index of 12. It is recolored with a new color code of 0.
  * Object 4 has an initial size of 3 and a starting index of 15. It is removed because it is not adjacent to any other object.
  * Random zeros are added to the input sequence to create noise.

Test Output:
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
