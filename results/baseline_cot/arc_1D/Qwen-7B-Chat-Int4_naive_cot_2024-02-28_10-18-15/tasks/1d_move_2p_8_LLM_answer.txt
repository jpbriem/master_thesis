prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern: The input and output sequences share the same transformation pattern where adjacent pixels of the same color are considered as an object, and any non-zero value represents a pixel with a specific color. 

Instructions: To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and perform operations on them accordingly. We can do this by iterating through each element in the input sequence and checking if it has the same color as the previous element. If it does, then we consider these two elements as part of the same object and add it to our set of objects. If there is no previous element, then we create a new object at this index. After identifying all the objects in the input sequence, we can iterate through each object and apply the necessary transformation operations (such as moving, scaling, etc.) to each object.

Transformation:

Input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Objects Description: There is one object in the input sequence, represented by [Object_1: {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 4}]. It consists of four consecutive pixels with the same color.
Transformed Objects: We need to move the object so that it covers all five pixels instead of just four. Therefore, we will create a new object called [Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 6, size: 5}] and update the previous object's end_index to 6.
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Note: In this example, we assume that the input sequence starts at index 1. Also, we don't change the color of the pixels outside the objects.
