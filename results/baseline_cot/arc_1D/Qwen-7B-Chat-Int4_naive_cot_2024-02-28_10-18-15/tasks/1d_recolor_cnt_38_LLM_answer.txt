prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 3, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2 with a size of 2, and Object_2 with color 0, starting at index 7 and ending at index 8 with a size of 1. In the output sequence, both objects have been moved one space closer together. This means that Object_1 is now located at index 0, and Object_2 is now located at index 7.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has three objects: Object_1 with color 3, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2 with a size of 2, Object_2 with color 0, starting at index 5 and ending at index 6 with a size of 1, and Object_3 with color 0, starting at index 11 and ending at index 12 with a size of 1. In the output sequence, all three objects have been removed. Therefore, there are no objects in the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has four objects: Object_1 with color 3, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2 with a size of 2, Object_2 with color 0, starting at index 4 and ending at index 5 with a size of 1, Object_3 with color 0, starting at index 7 and ending at index 8 with a size of 1, and Object_4 with color 0, starting at index 10 and ending at index 11 with a size of 1. In the output sequence, all four objects have been scaled up by a factor of 2. This means that each object's size has doubled, but their positions remain unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern of these examples is that the input and output sequences have similar structures, with objects being added, removed, scaled, or moved between them. However, the specific details of how these objects are transformed can vary depending on the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and determine what changes they require. You may need to consider factors such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment, and other conditions when making these decisions. Once you have identified the necessary transformations, you can apply them to the input sequence to create the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'In this input sequence, there are four objects: Object_1 with color 3, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2 with a size of 2, Object_2 with color 0, starting at index 5 and ending at index 6 with a size of 1, Object_3 with color 0, starting at index 11 and ending at index 12 with a size of 1, and Object_4 with color 0, starting at index 10 and ending at index 11 with a size of 1.', 'transformed_objects': 'For the transformed objects, we want to move Object_1 one space closer to Object_2, remove Object_3, and scale Object_4 up by a factor of 2.
