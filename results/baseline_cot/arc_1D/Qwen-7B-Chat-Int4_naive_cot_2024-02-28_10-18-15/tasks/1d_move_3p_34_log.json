            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence consists of 16 zeros followed by six sixes. In the output sequence, the sixes appear in their original positions and the remaining zeros remain unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence consists of two groups of four consecutive ones separated by two zeros. In the output sequence, the one group appears shifted to the right by one position compared to the input sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence consists of eight identical groups of eight consecutive zeros followed by an additional zero at the end. In the output sequence, each group remains unchanged except for the last zero, which has been removed.', }, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern observed in these examples is that there is a mapping between the input and output sequences where each object (in this case, a set of consecutive pixels) is moved, scaled, or removed from the input sequence to create the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you can follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. These are sets of consecutive pixels that have the same value.\n  2. Move each object according to its desired position in the output sequence. This can involve shifting it horizontally or vertically, depending on the desired layout.\n  3. Scale each object if necessary. If the desired size of the object does not match its current size, you can adjust its dimensions using scaling operations.\n  4. Remove any unwanted objects from the input sequence. If there are any elements in the input sequence that do not belong in the output sequence, you can delete them.\n  5. Copy any necessary objects from the input sequence to the output sequence. If there are any elements in the output sequence that need to be duplicated, you can copy them from the input sequence.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, you will have transformed the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided below:', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence and provide their descriptions here:', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the output sequence:', 'output': 'Create the output sequence by applying the transformation steps above.'}, 'test_output': 'Numpy array format'}}\nNote: You may need to perform some preprocessing steps before identifying the objects in the input sequence, such as converting the input sequence to grayscale or thresholding it to identify individual pixels. Also, keep in mind that the transformation steps may require some trial and error to achieve the desired result."
