prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has no noise pixels, while the output sequence contains one object.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains one object, which is translated to the right side of the image.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains two objects, one of which is moved closer to the center of the image.'}, 'Overall_pattern': 'In each example, there is an input sequence of pixels, and an output sequence of pixels where the number of objects is equal to the number of objects in the input sequence. Each object is transformed using various operations such as translation, scaling, removal, etc., according to the given transformation pattern.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence, apply the appropriate transformation operation to each object, and then combine the transformed objects into the final output sequence. Here are some steps to follow:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for groups of consecutive pixels with the same color value.
  * Apply the appropriate transformation operation to each object based on the given transformation pattern. For example, if the operation is "move", you would translate the object along a specified direction. If the operation is "scale", you would resize the object to a specified size. If the operation is "remove", you would delete the object from the output sequence. If the operation is "copy", you would duplicate the object at a specified location.
  * Combine the transformed objects into the final output sequence by placing them in their correct positions.

For Example_1, you can see that there is one object in the input sequence, which is located at index 10. You can apply the "translation" operation to this object by translating it to the left by one pixel. This will result in the output sequence shown above. Similarly, you can transform the other input-output pairs by applying the appropriate transformation operations to the identified objects and combining the transformed objects into the final output sequence. Finally, create the resulting test output sequence in numpy array format, making sure that the sequence length matches the input sequence length.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'In this example, there is one object located at index 10, which is a white pixel with a size of 8x8.
