prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The underlying transformation pattern in these examples is that the input sequence contains a set of objects of a specific color, where each object has a fixed size and position. The output sequence represents the same set of objects but with some changes applied to them. These changes can include moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, and applying other operations on the objects.
To transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence, we need to follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and size.
  2. Apply the necessary transformations to each object based on the instructions provided in the problem statement.
  3. Combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence.

Here's an example of how we could transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence using this approach:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example 1, the input sequence contains two objects of color 7, one at indices (1, 2) and another at indices (4, 5). In the output sequence, both objects have been moved to the left, and the second object has been scaled down.",
        "Example_2": "In Example 2, the input sequence contains four objects of color 6, arranged in a square. In the output sequence, the fourth object has been removed, and the remaining three objects have been shifted to the right.",
        "Example_3": "In Example 3, the input sequence contains six objects of color 2, arranged in a hexagon. In the output sequence, the third object has been copied twice, and the fifth object has been removed."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern in these examples involves transforming sets of objects based on instructions provided in the problem statement.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and size. Apply the necessary transformations to each object based on the instructions provided in the problem statement. Combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
        "object_description": "There are no objects in the input sequence.",
        "transformed_objects": "There are no objects in the output sequence.",
        "output": "[0]"
    },
    "test_output": "[0]"
}
```

Note that in this example, there are no objects in the input sequence, so the `transformed_objects` field is empty. Also, since there is only one object in the input sequence, it remains unchanged in the output sequence.
