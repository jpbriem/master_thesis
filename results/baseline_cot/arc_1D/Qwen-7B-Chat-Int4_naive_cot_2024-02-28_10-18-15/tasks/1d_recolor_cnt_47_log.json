            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: In this example, there are two objects: one is a square object (represented by the color 8) with a side length of 4, and another object is also a square object (represented by the color 3) with a side length of 3. Both objects are located at indices 1 and 5 respectively. After transformation, both objects are moved to their center positions and scaled down to half their original sizes.\n  * Example_2: This example has one object, represented by the color 3, with a side length of 3. It is located at index 1. After transformation, it is translated to the right by one pixel and its size remains unchanged.\n  * Example_3: There are three objects in this example: one is a circle object (represented by the color 8) with a radius of 4, another is a rectangle object (represented by the color 3) with a width of 4 and a height of 2, and the last one is a triangle object (represented by the color 0) with an edge length of 4. All objects are located at indices 1, 5, and 9 respectively. After transformation, the circle is moved to its center position and its size remains unchanged, while the rectangle is translated up by one pixel and its height remains unchanged. The triangle is translated down by one pixel and its width remains unchanged.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * Each input sequence consists of a set of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9 representing different colors, and 0 representing the background color.\n  * Each object is defined by its color, size, and location in the input sequence.\n  * Transformation operations include moving, scaling, translating, recoloring, removing, copying, and combining multiple objects.\n  * No noise pixels are present in the input or output sequences.\n  * Arithmetic operations involving objects can be performed, such as counting, sorting, and comparing sizes.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation operations to each object.\n  * You should pay attention to the size, position, and color of each object, and make sure they match the corresponding properties in the output sequence.\n  * Some objects may require more than one transformation operation to achieve the desired result.\n  * Once all objects have been transformed, you can combine them together to form the final output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Output: [0, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Description: In this example, we apply the transformation operation `move` to move each object in the input sequence to its center position. We then apply the transformation operation `scale` to reduce the size of each object to half its original size.\n  * Object Description: Each object is a square with a side length of 4.\n  * Transformed Objects: Each object is now a smaller square with a side length of 2, located at the center of its original position.\n  * Output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Explanation: We have applied the transformation operation `move` to move each object to its center position, and then applied the transformation operation `scale` to reduce the size of each object to half its original size. As a result, we get the output sequence where each object is now a smaller square with a side length of 2, located at the center of its original position.\n\nTest Output:\n\n  * Numpy Array Format: [[0, 0], [2, 2], [2, 2], [0, 0]]\n  * Explanation: The output sequence consists of four small squares arranged in a row. Each square has a side length of 2 and is located at the center of its original position."
