prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9]



Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:
In Example_1, we see an object consisting of 8 pixels of color 9 arranged in a row. In Example_2, the object has been moved horizontally so that it starts at index 5 instead of index 1. In Example_3, the object has been resized so that it now consists of 6 pixels of color 2.
Overall Pattern:
All three examples share the same overall pattern of transforming an object's size, position, and color. This can be achieved through various operations such as moving, resizing, and recoloring.
Instructions:

  * Move the object horizontally: To do this, you need to shift the object's coordinates by a certain amount. You can achieve this by subtracting the old start index from the new start index. If the object was originally located at index 1, then shifting it to index 5 means subtracting 4 from both its start and end indices.
  * Resize the object: To do this, you need to change the number of pixels in the object. You can achieve this by multiplying the original number of pixels by a scaling factor. For example, if the object had 8 pixels before being resized, then dividing it by 2 would give you a scaling factor of 0.5, meaning the new object will consist of 4 pixels.
  * Recolor the object: To do this, you need to change the color of each pixel in the object. You can achieve this by replacing each pixel's color value with a new one. For example, if the object used to have color 9, then changing each pixel's color to color 2 would recolor the object to use color 2.

Transformation:
Input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9]
Explanation:

  * Move the object horizontally: We need to shift the object's coordinates by 4. Therefore, the new start index becomes 5, and the new end index becomes 9.
  * Resize the object: We want the object to consist of 6 pixels of color 2. Therefore, we multiply the original number of pixels (8) by the scaling factor (0.75), which gives us a new number of pixels (6).
  * Recolor the object: We want the object to use color 2 instead of color 9. Therefore, we replace each pixel's color value with color 2.

Note: Since there are no noise pixels in this example, the final output sequence will contain only the transformed object.
