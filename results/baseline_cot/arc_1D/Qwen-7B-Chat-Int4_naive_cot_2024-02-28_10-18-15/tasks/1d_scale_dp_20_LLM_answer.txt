prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains six groups of six identical pixels (objects). In the output sequence, each group has been replaced by a single pixel with value 9.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains six groups of four identical pixels (objects). In the output sequence, each group has been replaced by a single pixel with value 9.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains one group of six identical pixels (object) and five groups of six zeros (background). In the output sequence, the group of six pixels has been replaced by a single pixel with value 9.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In these examples, the transformation involves replacing multiple occurrences of an object with a single occurrence of a different value. This pattern can be applied to any number of objects and any replacement value.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence, you need to identify the objects and their positions in the sequence. You then need to determine what value will replace them in the output sequence. Once you have done this, you can create the output sequence by replacing each object with the specified value.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided:', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions. In this case, there are three objects: two groups of six identical pixels and one group of six zeros.', 'transformed_objects': 'Replace each object with the specified value. In this case, replace the two groups of six pixels with a single pixel with value 9 and replace the group of six zeros with a single pixel with value 9.', 'output': 'Create the output sequence by replacing each object with the specified value. In this case, the output sequence would be: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9].'}}, 'test_output': 'numpy.array([0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9])' }
