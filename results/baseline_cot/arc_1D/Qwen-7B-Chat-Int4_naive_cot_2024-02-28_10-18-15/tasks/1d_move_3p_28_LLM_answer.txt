prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'Objects: two objects of color 2, one object of color 0, no noise pixels. Transformation: Move object of color 2 to the left.', 'Example_2': 'Objects: one object of color 8, one object of color 0, no noise pixels. Transformation: Recolor object of color 8 to black.', 'Example_3': 'Objects: one object of color 0, one object of color 7, no noise pixels. Transformation: Scale object of color 0 down by factor of 2.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Each input-output pair has two objects of the same color and no noise pixels. The transformation moves, recolors, or scales the objects depending on the specific instructions provided.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence, paying attention to their size, position, and color.
  * Determine the type of transformation required based on the instructions provided (move, recolor, scale).
  * Apply the transformation to each object accordingly.
  * Repeat this process for any additional objects in the input sequence.

For example, if the instruction is "Move object of color 2 to the left," you would identify the object of color 2 in the input sequence, determine that it needs to be moved to the left, and then apply the movement transformation to the object.
If the instruction is "Recolor object of color 8 to black," you would identify the object of color 8 in the input sequence, determine that it needs to be recolored to black, and then apply the recolor transformation to the object.
If the instruction is "Scale object of color 0 down by factor of 2," you would identify the object of color 0 in the input sequence, determine that it needs to be scaled down by factor of 2, and then apply the scaling transformation to the object.
Note that the specific details of the transformation will depend on the instructions provided and the characteristics of the input sequence. It may also require additional steps beyond those outlined above, depending on the complexity of the transformation.'}, 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
