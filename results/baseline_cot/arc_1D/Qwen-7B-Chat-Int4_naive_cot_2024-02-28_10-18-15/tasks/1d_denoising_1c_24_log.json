            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription of Example_1:\n\nIn this example, the input sequence consists of 36 identical pixels, each represented by the value 3. The output sequence also consists of 36 identical pixels, but they are represented by the value 0 instead of 3. This means that the input sequence has been transformed into an object representation where each pixel is replaced by an object representing the entire row of pixels. \n\nObject Description of Example_1:\n\nThere are two objects in this input-output pair. Both objects consist of 15 pixels, starting at index 1 and ending at index 15 (inclusive). The first object has a color of 3, while the second object has a color of 0.\n\nTransformed Objects of Example_1:\n\nTo transform the objects in this input-output pair, we need to replace each object with its corresponding output value. Therefore, both objects will be replaced by their respective output values, which are 0 and 3.\n\nOutput of Example_1:\n\nThe output sequence consists of 36 identical pixels, each represented by the value 0 or 3 depending on the corresponding object in the input sequence.\n\nOverall Pattern of Example_1:\n\nThe overall pattern in this input-output pair is that a set of identical pixels is transformed into an object representation where each pixel is replaced by an object representing the entire row of pixels. The objects themselves are then replaced by their corresponding output values.\n\nInstructions for Example_1:\n\nTo transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we need to create an object representation where each pixel is replaced by an object representing the entire row of pixels. Then, we can replace each object with its corresponding output value.\n\nTransformation for Example_1:\n\nHere's one way to transform the input sequence into its output sequence:\n\n  1. Create an empty object representation with 15 pixels, starting at index 1 and ending at index 15 (inclusive).\n  2. Iterate over the input sequence, checking if each pixel is equal to 3. If it is, add a new object to the object representation with a color of 3 and a size of 15 pixels.\n  3. Otherwise, add a new object to the object representation with a color of 0 and a size of 15 pixels.\n  4. Replace each pixel in the input sequence with its corresponding object in the object representation.\n  5. Replace each object in the object representation with its corresponding output value.\n\nTest Output of Example_1:\n\nHere's the transformed output sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
