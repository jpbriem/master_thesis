prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, we see that the objects in the input sequence are all identical and arranged in a line.

The remaining objects have remained unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern in these input-output pairs is that each input sequence contains multiple instances of the same object color, which are arranged in some way. Each output sequence corresponds to a modified version of the input sequence, where one or more objects have been replaced with other objects of different color. Alternatively, objects may have been removed entirely, or new objects may have been added to the sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine what changes they will undergo. You can do this by looking at the positions of the objects and their corresponding colors. Once you have identified the objects and their corresponding changes, you can apply those changes to the input sequence to obtain the corresponding output sequence. Remember to consider any conditions or constraints that may affect the transformation process.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Specifically, you need to find the object at index 5 (which was originally an instance of the class 7) and replace it with an instance of the class 9. This means that the object at index 5 will now have the color 9 instead of 7. Additionally, you need to ensure that all other objects remain unchanged. Therefore, the transformed output sequence should contain all the original objects but with the object at index 5 having the color 9 instead of 7.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence.
