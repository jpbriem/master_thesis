prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input has 16 objects. Each object consists of 3 pixels. The output has 16 objects, each consisting of 1 pixel. The objects are moved closer together, reducing their size.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input has 15 objects. Each object consists of 4 pixels. The output has 15 objects, each consisting of 4 pixels. The objects remain unchanged, but their positions shift slightly.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input has 16 objects. Each object consists of 4 pixels. The output has 16 objects, each consisting of 3 pixels. The objects are scaled down, increasing their size.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All three input-output pairs follow the same pattern where objects are transformed through various operations such as movement, scaling, and recoloring. These operations can change the size, position, and color of the objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels introduced into the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation operation to them. You can use the information provided about the transformation patterns to guide your decision-making process. Some common operations include moving objects closer together, scaling objects up or down, and recoloring objects. Once you have applied the necessary transformations, the resulting output sequence will match the specified output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task. Focus on identifying the objects in the sequence and understanding the desired output sequence.', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence by counting the number of pixels in each group of adjacent pixels with the same color. Also note the starting and ending indices of each object in the input sequence. This information will help you understand the structure of the input sequence.', 'transformed_objects': 'To transform the objects in the input sequence, apply the appropriate transformation operation to each object. For example, if you want to move two objects closer together, you could combine their positions and reduce the overall size of the objects. If you want to recolor an object, you could replace its current color with a new color. It is important to keep track of the changes made to each object so that the final output sequence matches the specified output sequence.', 'output': 'Create the output sequence by applying the appropriate transformation operations to the input sequence. Make sure that the resulting sequence has the same number of objects as the specified output sequence and that each object matches the desired characteristics (size, position, color).'}, 'test_output': '[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}
