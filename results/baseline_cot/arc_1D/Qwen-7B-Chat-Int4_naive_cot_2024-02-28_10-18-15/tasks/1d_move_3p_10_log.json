            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: The input sequence consists of 9 objects, each represented by a contiguous group of 8 pixels. The output sequence contains the same number of objects but their positions and sizes may vary. The transformation involves moving and scaling the objects while preserving their original colors.\nInstructions: To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and then apply appropriate transformations to them. You can use the following steps:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for contiguous groups of 8 pixels with the same color.\n  * Move the objects by changing their positions within the input sequence. If an object's position changes, it means that it has been moved to a different location in the input sequence.\n  * Scale the objects by changing their size within the input sequence. If an object's size changes, it means that it has been resized in either width or height.\n  * Remove any empty space between the objects in the input sequence.\n  * Copy any remaining objects to create new objects if necessary.\n  * Recolor any objects if their color changes in the input sequence.\n\nTransformation: Here is one possible way to transform the input sequence into the output sequence using these instructions:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence: There are three objects, each represented by a contiguous group of 8 pixels with the same color (0).\n  * Move the objects: The first object starts at index 0 and ends at index 7, so we can move it to index 5 without changing its size or color. The second object starts at index 8 and ends at index 15, so we can move it to index 13 without changing its size or color. The third object starts at index 16 and ends at index 23, so we can move it to index 21 without changing its size or color.\n  * Scale the objects: None of the objects have changed size.\n  * Remove any empty space: There is no empty space between the objects.\n  * Copy any remaining objects: None of the objects have been copied.\n  * Recolor any objects: None of the objects have changed color.\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nNote: This solution assumes that there is no overlap between the objects in the input sequence. In practice, you may need to handle overlapping objects differently depending on the specific requirements of the transformation pattern."
