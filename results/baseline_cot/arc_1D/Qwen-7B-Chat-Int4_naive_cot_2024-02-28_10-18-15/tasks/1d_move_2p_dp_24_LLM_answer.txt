prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has no noise pixels. All pixels are either 0 (background) or 2 (objects). There are two objects, each consisting of nine pixels. They are horizontally aligned.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, there is one object consisting of nine pixels. It is vertically aligned. There is also a noise pixel at index 8.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, there are three objects. Each consists of five pixels. They are horizontally aligned.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'All input-output pairs follow the same transformation pattern. In this pattern, an object can be moved, scaled, copied, recolored, hollowed out, removed, or modified in some way. Noise pixels can also appear in the input or output sequences. Additionally, objects may align horizontally or vertically.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify any objects in the input sequence and modify them according to their properties. You can do so by moving, scaling, copying, recoloring, hollowing out, removing, or modifying them in some way. If there are any noise pixels in the input sequence, they will remain unchanged in the output sequence. Finally, if there are any objects that align horizontally or vertically, you need to ensure that they maintain their alignment in the output sequence. For example, if you move an object horizontally in the input sequence, it should also be moved horizontally in the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence.

The second object consists of nine pixels and is vertically aligned.', 'transformed_objects': 'The first object should be moved to the left by one pixel. The second object should be moved down by one pixel. Both objects should be scaled up by 1.5 times.
