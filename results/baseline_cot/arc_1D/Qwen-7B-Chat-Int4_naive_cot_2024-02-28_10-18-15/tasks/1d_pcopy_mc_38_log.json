            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: In each example, there appears to be a pattern where adjacent pixels with the same color are grouped together to form an object, and these objects can be moved, scaled, or removed. Additionally, there may be noise pixels that do not belong to any object.\nInstructions: To transform a new input into its output, we need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and then apply the necessary operations to them. We can start by grouping adjacent pixels with the same color into objects using the same logic used in the examples provided. Once we have identified the objects, we can apply operations such as moving, scaling, or removing them according to their properties and relationships. Finally, we need to remove any noise pixels that do not belong to any object.\nTransformation:\n\nInput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nDescription of Objects:\n\nObject_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}\nObject_2: {color: 6, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 2}\nObject_3: {color: 3, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 2}\n\nDescription of Transformation:\n\nTo transform the input into its output, we need to group the adjacent pixels with the same color into objects as shown above. After identifying the objects, we can apply the necessary operations to them. For this particular input, it seems that the objects are already arranged correctly, so no further action needs to be taken.\n\nTherefore, the final output will be the same as the original input:\n\nOutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
