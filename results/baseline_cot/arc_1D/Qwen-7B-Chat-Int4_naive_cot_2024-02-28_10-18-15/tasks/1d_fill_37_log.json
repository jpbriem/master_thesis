            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, each object has been replaced by its corresponding object with a value one greater than itself.

This can be interpreted as a horizontal shift.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, each object has been replaced by its corresponding object with a value seven greater than itself. This can be interpreted as a diagonal shift.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The transformation pattern involves replacing each object in the input sequence with its corresponding object with a value increased by a constant amount. The direction of the shift depends on the specific example.', 'instructions': 'To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n  2. Determine the increase in value for each object.\n  3. Replace each object in the input sequence with its corresponding object with the increased value.\n  4. Repeat this process until all objects have been accounted for.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the increase in value for each object is one, so we replace each object with its corresponding object with a value one greater than itself. In Example 2, the increase in value for each object is five, so we replace each object with its corresponding object with a value five greater than itself. And in Example 3, the increase in value for each object is seven, so we replace each object with its corresponding object with a value seven greater than itself.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
