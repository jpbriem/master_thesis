            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has no objects. However, after applying the transformation, an object appears at the center of the sequence with the same color as the surrounding pixels.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, two objects appear, one on each side of the input sequence. After applying the transformation, these objects become aligned horizontally and their colors remain unchanged.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, four objects appear, two on each side of the input sequence. After applying the transformation, these objects become aligned vertically and their colors remain unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Each input sequence contains a single object or multiple objects arranged in specific patterns. The transformation changes the position, size, or orientation of the objects while preserving their colors. In some cases, noise pixels may also appear.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence, you need to identify the objects in it and apply the necessary transformations to them. You can perform the following steps:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for pixels with the same color.\n  * Determine the desired position, size, or orientation of the objects.\n  * Apply the necessary transformations to the objects, including moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc.\n  * Optionally, add noise pixels to create more variety in the output sequence.\n\nFor example, if you want to align two objects horizontally, you would move one of them to the right until it overlaps with the other object. If you want to increase the size of an object, you would duplicate it and place it closer to the original object. If you want to change the color of an object, you would replace its current color with another color. Finally, you would combine the modified objects and any added noise pixels to form the final output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the test case.', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for pixels with the same color. Each object should have a unique color and a defined shape (e.g., rectangle).', 'transformed_objects': 'Use the following guidelines to modify the objects:\n\n  * Move the objects to a new location using the `move` operation.\n  * Scale the objects to a new size using the `scale` operation.\n  * Remove the objects using the `remove` operation.\n  * Copy the objects to create duplicates using the `copy` operation.\n  * Recolor the objects using the `recolor` operation.\n\nFor example, to move an object to the left, you would subtract its x-coordinate from the current x-coordinate. To scale an object up or down, you would multiply its width or height by a factor. To remove an object, you would set its x-coordinate and y-coordinate to zero. To copy an object, you would make a deep copy of its properties. To recolor an object, you would assign a new color to its pixels.', 'output': 'Create the resulting output sequence by combining the modified objects and any added noise pixels.
