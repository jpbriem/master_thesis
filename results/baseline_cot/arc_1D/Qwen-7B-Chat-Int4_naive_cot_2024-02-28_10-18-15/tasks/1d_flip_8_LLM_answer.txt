prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The transformation pattern shared among these examples involves moving objects around in the input sequence. Specifically, each object is moved one position to the right. This pattern can be inferred by looking at the differences between the input and output sequences, where we see that each object has been shifted over one index.
To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to shift each object one position to the right. This means that the second object (with value 4) should become the third object (with value 5), the third object (with value 5) should become the fourth object (with value 6), and so on. After shifting all the objects, we get the following output sequence:

```
[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Therefore, the transformation applied to this input sequence is `move` objects one position to the right. To create the test output sequence, we simply need to apply this transformation to the input sequence:

```css
[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0].shift(-1)
[0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Therefore, the transformed output sequence is `[0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. We can confirm that this matches the expected output by comparing it to the original output sequence:

```css
[0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0]
```

We can also check that the number of elements in both input and output sequences is equal:

```scss
len([0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]) == len([0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0])
```

which confirms that the transformation was correctly applied. Therefore, the test output sequence is:

```python
[0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
