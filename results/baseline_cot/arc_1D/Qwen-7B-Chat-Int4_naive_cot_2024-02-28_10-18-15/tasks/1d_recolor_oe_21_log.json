            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription of the input-output relationships:\n\n  * In Example_1, the input sequence has three objects: two red squares (objects 1 and 2) and one black square (object 3). The output sequence also has three objects, but their positions and sizes have been modified. Specifically, object 1 has moved closer to object 2 and its size has increased; object 2 has remained in the same position and its size has decreased; and object 3 has been removed entirely.\n  * In Example_2, the input sequence has four objects: two red squares (objects 1 and 2), one blue square (object 3), and one black square (object 4). The output sequence has four objects as well, but their positions and sizes have been modified. Specifically, object 1 has moved closer to object 2 and its size has increased; object 2 has remained in the same position and its size has decreased; object 3 has remained in the same position and its size has increased; and object 4 has been removed entirely.\n  * In Example_3, the input sequence has six objects: two green squares (objects 1 and 2), one yellow square (object 3), one blue square (object 4), one red square (object 5), and one black square (object 6). The output sequence has six objects as well, but their positions and sizes have been modified. Specifically, object 1 has moved closer to object 2 and its size has increased; object 2 has remained in the same position and its size has decreased; object 3 has remained in the same position and its size has increased; object 4 has remained in the same position and its size has decreased; object 5 has moved closer to object 6 and its size has increased; and object 6 has been removed entirely.\n\nInstructions for transforming a new input into its output:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence, paying attention to their size, position, and color.\n  * Determine how each object should appear in the output sequence, considering its size, position, and color.\n  * Apply any necessary transformations to the objects, such as moving them, scaling them, removing them, copying them, recoloring them, etc.\n  * Ensure that the output sequence has the correct number of objects and that they are arranged correctly relative to each other.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n  * Object description: There are six objects, five of which are identical green squares (objects 1 through 5) and one identical black square (object 6).\n  * Transformed objects: Each green square should remain in the same position and size, while the black square should be removed entirely.\n  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nNote that this transformation is just an example, and there may be many other valid transformations depending on the specific details of the input sequence."
