            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5]\noutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: The transformation involves copying and filling in zeros to create a series of objects where each object has the same color as the previous one. The number of copies of each object depends on the value of the next pixel in the sequence. If the next pixel is equal to the current object's color, then no change occurs; otherwise, a new object of the same color is created and copied to the appropriate positions. The final result is a sequence where each pixel corresponds to an object, and the objects are arranged horizontally.\nInstructions: To transform this input into its output, we need to follow these steps:\n\n  1. Copy the first two pixels (0 and 2) to form the first object.\n  2. Copy the third pixel (2) to form the second object.\n  3. Copy the fourth pixel (2) to form the third object.\n  4. Copy the fifth pixel (2) to form the fourth object.\n  5. Copy the sixth pixel (2) to form the fifth object.\n  6. Copy the seventh pixel (2) to form the sixth object.\n  7. Copy the eighth pixel (2) to form the seventh object.\n  8. Copy the ninth pixel (2) to form the eighth object.\n  9. Copy the tenth pixel (2) to form the ninth object.\n  10. Copy the eleventh pixel (2) to form the tenth object.\n  11. Copy the twelfth pixel (2) to form the eleventh object.\n  12. Fill in zeros to complete the sequence.\n  13. Repeat steps 1-12 until the entire sequence is filled in.\n\nTransformation:\n```css\ninput = [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]\nobject_description = [\n    {\"color\": 2, \"start_index\": 1, \"end_index\": 2, \"size\": 2},\n    {\"color\": 2, \"start_index\": 4, \"end_index\": 4, \"size\": 1}\n]\ntransformed_objects = [\n    {\"color\": 2, \"start_index\": 1, \"end_index\": 2, \"size\": 2},\n    {\"color\": 2, \"start_index\": 4, \"end_index\": 4, \"size\": 1}\n]\noutput = [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5]\n```\n\nTest Output:\n```scss\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5]\n```"
