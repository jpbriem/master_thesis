            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ \"description\": {\"Example_1\": \"In Example 1, the input sequence has two objects. The first object consists of six 4s, while the second object consists of one 7. In the output sequence, the two objects remain unchanged, but their positions have been swapped.\", \"Example_2\": \"In Example 2, the input sequence has three objects. The first object consists of six 0s, the second object consists of four 7s, and the third object consists of one 4. In the output sequence, the order of the objects has been reversed, so that the first object now contains four 7s, the second object now contains six 0s, and the third object now contains one 4.\" }, \"overall_pattern\": \"The input-output relationship for these examples can be described as follows: each input sequence has multiple objects, where each object consists of a fixed number of identical elements. The objects may overlap, and they may contain noise pixels. The output sequences are obtained by swapping the positions of the objects relative to each other, without changing their sizes or contents. This pattern can be applied to any input sequence with multiple objects, provided that the objects have the same size and content, and that they do not overlap too much.\", \"instructions\": \"To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. Each object consists of a fixed number of identical elements.\n  2. Determine the positions of the objects relative to each other. If the objects overlap, you will need to resolve this issue before proceeding.\n  3. Swap the positions of the objects relative to each other, without changing their sizes or contents.\n\nFor example, if the input sequence has two objects, one consisting of five 2s and another consisting of one 0, you could swap their positions like this: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]. This would produce the output sequence [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2].\n  4. Repeat this process for each object in the input sequence.\n\nNote that this transformation pattern assumes that the input and output sequences have the same length, and that the objects in the input and output sequences have the same size and content. If these assumptions are violated, you will need to modify the transformation accordingly.\" , \"transformation\": {\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\", \"object_description\": \"The input sequence consists of multiple objects, including two 2s and one 0.\", \"transformed_objects\": \"Swap the positions of the two 2s and the one 0 to obtain the output sequence.\", \"output\": \"[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2]\" }, \"test_output\": \"[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2]\" }"
