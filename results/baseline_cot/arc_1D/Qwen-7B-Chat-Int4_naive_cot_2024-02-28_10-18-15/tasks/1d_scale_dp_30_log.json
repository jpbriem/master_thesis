            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ \"description\": {\"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects - one of color 3 and another of color 4. The object of color 3 covers the entire sequence, while the object of color 4 starts at index 6 and ends at index 7, covering two adjacent pixels of color 3.\", \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, the input sequence has two objects - one of color 2 and another of color 4. Both objects cover the entire sequence.\" }, \"overall_pattern\": \"The input-output pattern involves transforming an input sequence of pixels into an output sequence of pixels by creating new objects out of existing ones. Each object can be moved, scaled, copied, recolored, or removed. Objects may also overlap or contain each other. In addition, there may be noise pixels in the input sequence that do not affect the output sequence.\" , \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify any existing objects in the input sequence.\n  2. Determine if any new objects need to be created.\n  3. Move, scale, copy, recolor, or remove any existing objects as necessary.\n  4. Check for overlapping or contained objects and adjust them accordingly.\n  5. Add any new objects to the output sequence.\n  6. Remove any noise pixels from the input sequence that do not affect the output sequence.\n\nFor Example_1, you would create a new object of color 3 starting at index 1 and ending at index 2, covering the three adjacent pixels of color 0. You would then add this new object to the output sequence, removing the original object of color 3 entirely.\nFor Example_2, you would simply copy the entire input sequence to the output sequence without making any changes.\nFor Example_3, you would create a new object of color 4 starting at index 6 and ending at index 7, covering the two adjacent pixels of color 3. You would then add this new object to the output sequence, removing the original objects of color 3 and 4 entirely.\" , \"transformation\": {\"input\": \"[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]\", \"object_description\": \"There are no existing objects in the input sequence.\", \"transformed_objects\": \"Create a new object of color 4 starting at index 6 and ending at index 7, covering the two adjacent pixels of color 3.
