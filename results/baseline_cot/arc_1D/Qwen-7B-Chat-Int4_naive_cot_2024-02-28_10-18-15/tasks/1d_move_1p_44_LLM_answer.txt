prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, we can see that each object has been replaced with its color value (from 1 to 9). Specifically, the object at index 1 has been replaced with 7, the object at index 2 has been replaced with 7, and so on.', 'Example_2': 'Similarly, in Example_2, each object has been replaced with its color value (from 1 to 9). Specifically, the object at index 1 has been replaced with 3, the object at index 2 has been replaced with 3, and so on.', 'Example_3': 'Again, in Example_3, each object has been replaced with its color value (from 1 to 9). Specifically, the object at index 1 has been replaced with 8, the object at index 2 has been replaced with 8, and so on.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each example, an object at a specific index has been replaced with its color value. This process continues until no more objects need to be replaced.', 'instructions': 'To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you will need to iterate through the input sequence and replace each object at a specific index with its color value. You can do this using a loop and checking if each element is equal to 0 (the background color) and then replacing it with the corresponding color value. After iterating through the entire input sequence, you will have transformed it into its corresponding output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for elements that are equal to 0 (the background color).', 'transformed_objects': 'Replace each object at its corresponding index with its color value. Specifically, if an element is equal to 0, replace it with the corresponding color value. If an element is already equal to its corresponding color value, skip over it.', 'output': 'After transforming the input sequence, you will have a transformed output sequence where each object at a specific index has been replaced with its color value.'}}
```scss
# Transform the input sequence
transformed_output = []
for i in range(len(input)):
    # Check if the current element is equal to 0
    if input[i] == 0:
        # Replace the element with its corresponding color value
        transformed_output.append(input[i])
    else:
        # Append the current element to the transformed output sequence
        transformed_output.append(input[i])

print(transformed_output)
```

Output:
[5, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
