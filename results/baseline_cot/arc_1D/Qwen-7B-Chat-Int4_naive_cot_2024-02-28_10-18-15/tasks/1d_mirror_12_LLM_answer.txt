prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence consists of 16 pixels, each with value 0 or 3. The output sequence has the same number of pixels but with values 0 or 9 (background). The main difference between the two sequences is the presence/absence of object(s) in the output sequence. In the input sequence there are no objects, while in the output sequence one object appears. This object is composed of 8 pixels with value 3.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence consists of 17 pixels, each with value 0 or 2.

However, the output sequence may contain additional objects compared to the input sequence. The number of objects can vary depending on the input sequence. Each object is composed of a fixed number of pixels with a specific color value. The objects in the output sequence are arranged in a specific order, either horizontally or vertically, depending on their size. The transformation rule involves adding new objects to the output sequence, changing the color of existing objects, removing some objects, and possibly moving some objects around.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify any existing objects in the input sequence and add new ones if necessary. You also need to change the color of existing objects if required. If there are any empty spaces in the input sequence, you need to create new objects to fill those gaps. Finally, you need to arrange the objects in the output sequence according to the specified order. Specifically, if the input sequence contains n objects, then the output sequence will contain at least n+1 objects. The objects in the output sequence are arranged in a row, with each object being placed in a consecutive position starting from the leftmost position. The objects in the output sequence must be arranged in ascending order of their height, i.e., the tallest object should be placed at the top of the output sequence and the shortest object should be placed at the bottom of the output sequence. The objects in the output sequence must also be arranged in descending order of their width, i'th object having the largest width should be placed to the right of the i-1th object.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task description. Pay attention to the number of pixels and the color values. Note that the input sequence may contain objects or may be empty.

The number of pixels in each object is determined by the input sequence, but it must be greater than or equal to 4. The objects in the output sequence are arranged in a specific order, either horizontally or vertically, depending on their size. The size of each object is determined by the input sequence, but it must be greater than or equal to 2.

To do this, we can iterate through the input sequence and check whether each pixel has the same color as the previous pixel. If so, we can increment a counter variable. Once we have counted all the objects, we can generate a new sequence with the same number of objects and the same background color, using the counter variable to determine the color of each pixel. We can then sort the objects in the output sequence according to their height and width, and place them in the correct positions.'}
