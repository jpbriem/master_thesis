            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern:\nThe input-output pairs follow a pattern where each object is represented by a specific number value. These numbers can represent different pixel colors or background color. The order of these numbers determines the placement of the objects in the image. If an object has a smaller number value, it will appear closer to the center of the image. If an object has a larger number value, it will appear further away from the center of the image. Additionally, if two objects touch, they will be considered as one object, and their combined number value will be used to determine their position in the image. \n\nInstructions:\nTo transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation operations to them. Here's how we can do this:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: We can do this by looking at the adjacent pixel values that are equal to each other. Any consecutive group of equal values will represent an object. In the given input sequence, there are four objects present: [Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 5}, Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 6, end_index: 11, size: 5}, Object_3: {color: 7, start_index: 12, end_index: 17, size: 5}, Object_4: {color: 0, start_index: 18, end_index: 22, size: 5}]. Note that we also count the background color (represented by 0) as an object.\n  2. Apply the appropriate transformation operations: Once we have identified the objects, we can apply the appropriate transformation operations to them. Some common operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc. Let's assume that we want to move Object_1 to the right by two positions. To achieve this, we can simply change the values of the adjacent pixels to 1 and 0, respectively. Similarly, we can move Object_2 to the left by two positions, move Object_3 up by two positions, and move Object_4 down by two positions. After applying these transformations, the output sequence would look like this: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n  3. Check for noise pixels: We should also check for any noise pixels in the input and output sequences. A noise pixel is defined as a pixel value that does not belong to any object in the image. We can detect noise pixels by checking if there are any consecutive groups of unequal pixel values in the input or output sequences. If we find any noise pixels, we should remove them before proceeding with the next steps.\n\nTest Output:\nThe test output sequence for the given input sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This sequence represents the same image as the input sequence but with the objects moved according to the instructions provided above."
