            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\nThe underlying transformation pattern involves applying an operation to the input sequence to generate the corresponding output sequence. In each example, we see that adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects, and then these objects are manipulated using various operations such as moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc., to create the final output sequence.\nOverall Pattern:\nThe overall pattern can be summarized as follows:\n\n  * Input sequence contains a set of pixels where each pixel has a value from 1 to 9 representing a specific color, and 0 representing the background color.\n  * Output sequence also contains a set of pixels, but with some differences compared to the input sequence.\n  * There are two types of objects in the input sequence: noise pixels and object pixels. Noise pixels are those with a value of 0, while object pixels are those with a value greater than 0.\n  * Each object pixel corresponds to an object in the output sequence, which may undergo various operations such as movement, scaling, removal, copying, recoloring, etc.\n  * The number of objects in the output sequence depends on the number of object pixels in the input sequence.\n  * Some objects may overlap or contain other objects, depending on their positions and sizes.\n  * The overall goal is to transform the input sequence into the output sequence using appropriate operations.\n\nInstructions:\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by finding pixels with a value greater than 0.\n  2. Analyze the properties of each object (e.g., size, position, color).\n  3. Apply appropriate operations to manipulate the objects in the input sequence to create the desired output sequence.\n  4. Repeat steps 1-3 until you obtain the desired output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nObject Description:\nIn this input sequence, there are four objects:\n\n  * Object_1: [color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 5, size: 5], which is a group of five consecutive pixels with value 1.\n  * Object_2: [color: 1, start_index: 6, end_index: 10, size: 5], which is another group of five consecutive pixels with value 1.\n  * Object_3: [color: 1, start_index: 11, end_index: 15, size: 5], which is yet another group of five consecutive pixels with value 1.\n  * Object_4: [color: 0, start_index: 16, end_index: 18, size: 2], which is a single pixel with value 0.\n\nTransformed Objects:\nTo create the desired output sequence, we need to apply suitable operations to manipulate the objects in the input sequence. Here's one possible approach:\n\n  * Move Object_1 to the right by one pixel, so it becomes Object_2. This means we need to shift the pixels in the range [1, 5) to the left by one pixel, and shift the pixels in the range [6, 10) to the right by one pixel.\n  * Scale Object_2 by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, so it becomes twice as big. This means we need to increase the size of each pixel in Object_2 by a factor of 2.\n  * Remove Object_3 completely from the output sequence, since it does not overlap any other object.\n  * Copy Object_4 unchanged to the output sequence.\n\nOutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNote that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid approaches to transforming the input sequence into the output sequence."
