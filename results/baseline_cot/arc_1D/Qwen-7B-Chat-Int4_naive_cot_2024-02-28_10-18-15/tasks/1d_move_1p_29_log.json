            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe input-output patterns shown in Examples 1, 2, and 3 follow the same logic. In each example, there is an object that consists of multiple pixels with the same color. The input sequence has a large number of these objects, where each object is surrounded by zero pixels (background). The output sequence removes the background pixels around each object, leaving only the object itself. \n\nFor the given test case, the input sequence contains one large object consisting of six pixels with the color 6. The output sequence will remove the background pixels around this object, leaving only the six pixels in their original positions. Therefore, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\n```\n[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n```\n\n\nHere's the JSON description of the transformation pattern and instructions:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example 1, the input sequence has two objects with the same color, separated by zero pixels. The output sequence removes the zero pixels around each object, leaving only the object itself.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example 2, the input sequence has three objects with the same color, separated by zero pixels. The output sequence removes the zero pixels around each object, leaving only the object itself.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"In Example 3, the input sequence has four objects with the same color, separated by zero pixels. The output sequence removes the zero pixels around each object, leaving only the object itself.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"The input-output patterns shown above involve removing zero pixels around objects with the same color. This results in the objects being isolated from the background.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, you need to find the objects with the same color and remove the zero pixels around them. You can do this by iterating over the input sequence and checking if adjacent pixels have the same value. If they do, then you know that there is an object, so you need to add it to a set of objects. Once you've found all the objects, you can iterate over the set and remove any zero pixels that surround them. Finally, you can return the resulting sequence of objects.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\",\n        \"object_description\": \"The input sequence consists of a single object with the color 6, surrounded by zero pixels.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\",\n        \"output\": \"[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\"\n}\n```"
