prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains several identical objects (represented by 6) arranged in a specific order. In the output sequence, these objects have been removed, leaving only one object at each location. The remaining objects have been scaled up so they cover the entire space.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains two objects of the same color (represented by 6), but their positions are different. In the output sequence, these objects have been moved closer together, and their sizes have been reduced to match the new position.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains a single large object (represented by 6) surrounded by smaller objects (represented by 0). In the output sequence, the larger object has been hollowed out, removing the inner smaller objects.', 'Overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the input sequence consists of objects of various sizes, shapes, and colors arranged in a specific order. The output sequence represents the same objects, but with some modifications applied to them. These modifications can include changing the color, size, shape, position, or presence of an object altogether.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and apply the appropriate modification to each object. This could involve scaling, moving, recoloring, or removing an object entirely. Once you have made the necessary changes, create the resulting output sequence. Remember to pay attention to the sequence length and ensure that the output sequence matches the desired output pattern.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'For each object in the input sequence, identify its size, shape, color, and position. Consider how this information relates to the overall pattern of the input sequence.', 'transformed_objects': 'Based on the description of the objects in the input sequence, determine how each object should be modified in the output sequence. For example, if there is a large object surrounded by smaller objects, you may choose to hollow it out to reveal the inner smaller objects. Alternatively, if there is a small object surrounded by larger objects, you may choose to expand it to cover more space. Pay close attention to the desired output pattern and make sure that your modifications align with this pattern.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by applying the appropriate modifications to each object in the input sequence. Ensure that the output sequence matches the desired output pattern and has the correct sequence length. You can use any tools or techniques you prefer to help you achieve this goal.'}, 'test_output': 'Here is the transformed test output sequence: \n[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}}
