prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern: Each input sequence has 16 elements, where the first 8 elements represent the background color (0), followed by 8 consecutive pixels of the same color. In each subsequent pair of consecutive pixels, one element is replaced by an object with a unique color. The number of objects increases by 1 every 2 pairs of consecutive pixels. When there is no more space to add another object, the last remaining element is added back to the beginning of the sequence. The output sequence also has 16 elements, but the objects are arranged differently than in the input sequence. The objects are placed at the positions they occupied in the original sequence, but their colors are reversed. Additionally, any object whose last two elements were both zeros is removed from the output sequence.
Instructions: To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

  1. Identify the background color and the number of objects in the input sequence.
  2. Create an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
  3. Add the background color to the output sequence at the beginning.
  4. Iterate through the input sequence, starting from the second element. If the current element is not equal to the previous element, it means that a new object has been introduced. Add this object to the output sequence, replacing the current element and the next two elements. If the current element is equal to the previous element, continue to the next element.
  5. After iterating through all elements in the input sequence, check if the last two elements are both zeros. If so, remove them from the output sequence.
  6. Return the final output sequence.
