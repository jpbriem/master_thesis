            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]\noutput: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1:\n    * Transformation: Move objects one pixel towards right direction.\n    * Description: The objects are moved one pixel towards the right direction, so the object at index 1 becomes index 2 and the object at index 5 becomes index 6. All other objects remain unchanged.\n    * Instructions: To transform this input into its output, you need to move each object one pixel towards the right direction. Start from the leftmost object and move it one pixel to the right until you reach the rightmost object. Repeat this process for every object in the sequence.\n    * Transformed Objects: [[Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 1}, Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1}]]\n    * Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9]\n  * Example_2:\n    * Transformation: Scale objects by factor 2.\n    * Description: The objects are scaled by a factor of two, so each object's width and height are doubled. This means that the object at index 1 has become an object with twice the size of the original object.\n    * Instructions: To transform this input into its output, you need to double the size of each object. Start from the leftmost object and double its size until you reach the rightmost object. Repeat this process for every object in the sequence.\n    * Transformed Objects: [[Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 2}]]\n    * Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 18, 18, 18, 18, 16, 0, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 18, 18, 18]\n  * Example_3:\n    * Transformation: Remove object at index 3.\n    * Description: An object at index 3 is removed from the sequence. This means that there will no longer be any object at this index.\n    * Instructions: To transform this input into its output, you need to remove the object at index 3. You can do this by simply deleting the element at this index.\n    * Transformed Objects: [[Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 1}, Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1}]]\n    * Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9]\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * The overall pattern is that the transformation involves moving, scaling, and removing objects in the input sequence. These operations are performed on individual objects within the sequence.\n  * The transformation rule applies to all input-output pairs and requires understanding the structure of the input sequence and the desired output sequence.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n    * Identify the objects in the input sequence using the `object_description` field.\n    * Apply the appropriate transformation operation to each object using the `transformed_objects` field.\n    * Combine the transformed objects into a single sequence using the `output` field.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n  * Object Description: There are six objects, each consisting of four elements (start index, end index, size, color). The objects are arranged in a linear sequence with no overlap.\n  * Transformed Objects: [[Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 1}, Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 5, size: 1}]]\n  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9]\n\nTest Output:\n\n  * Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format.Mind the sequence length!\n```css\narray([0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9])\n```"
