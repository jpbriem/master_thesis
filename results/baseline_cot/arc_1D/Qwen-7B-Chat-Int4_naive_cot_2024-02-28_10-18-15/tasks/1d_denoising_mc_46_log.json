            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe overall pattern of these examples is that they involve transforming an input sequence of pixels into an output sequence where adjacent pixels of the same color represent objects. The transformation involves copying and changing the color of some of the pixels in the input sequence to create the objects in the output sequence.\nTo transform a new input into its output, one can follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their size, position, and color.\n  2. Create a copy of the input sequence.\n  3. Change the color of each object in the copy according to its original color and any other desired changes.\n  4. Remove any noise pixels (pixels with a different color than the surrounding pixels).\n  5. Sort the remaining pixels by color.\n\nFor example, given the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], one could identify two objects: one consisting of the pixels [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 9] with the color [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 9] and another consisting of the pixels [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] with the color [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. To transform this input into its output, one could do the following:\n\n  * Copy the input sequence to get the copy [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n  * Change the color of each object in the copy to match its original color. In this case, the color of the first object would become [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 9], and the color of the second object would remain unchanged.\n  * Remove any noise pixels. In this case, there are no noise pixels.\n  * Sort the remaining pixels by color. In this case, the sorted sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4].\n\nTherefore, the output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]."
