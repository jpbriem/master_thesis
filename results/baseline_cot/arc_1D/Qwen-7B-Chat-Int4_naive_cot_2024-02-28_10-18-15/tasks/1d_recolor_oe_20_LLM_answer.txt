prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": {
    "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input has 8 objects (counting the background). They are arranged in a line, starting at index 0 and ending at index 7. Each object consists of 5 consecutive pixels of the same color. The output has 6 objects. They are also arranged in a line, but now they start at index 1 and end at index 5. The size of each object is reduced from 5 to 3 pixels.",
    "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input has 8 objects (counting the background). They are arranged in a square, with each object consisting of 5 consecutive pixels of the same color. The output has 6 objects. They are also arranged in a square, but now the size of each object is reduced from 5 to 3 pixels."
},
"overall_pattern": "Objects can be moved, resized, or removed from an image. In this specific pattern, the objects are always arranged in a line or a square, and their size is reduced by half.",
"instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, you need to find the largest object in the input and duplicate it multiple times until there are enough objects. Then, sort the objects by size and arrange them in a line or a square, depending on the input. Finally, reduce the size of each object by half.",
"transformation": {"input": "[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]", "object_description": "There are 8 objects in the input. They are arranged in a line, starting at index 0 and ending at index 7. Each object consists of 5 consecutive pixels of the same color.", "transformed_objects": "Duplicate the largest object (with index 7) three times. Sort the objects by size in descending order and arrange them in a line. Reduce the size of each object by half." },
