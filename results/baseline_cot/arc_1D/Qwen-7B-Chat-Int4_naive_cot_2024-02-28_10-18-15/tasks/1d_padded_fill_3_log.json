            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Each object in an input sequence corresponds to a specific pixel value in the output sequence. When an object moves, its corresponding pixel value changes accordingly. When an object is recolored, its corresponding pixel value changes to a new color. Finally, when an object is removed, its corresponding pixel value becomes 0. \n\nIn Example_1, we can see that there are two objects represented by the numbers 2 and 0. Both objects start at position 1 and remain unchanged throughout the sequence. However, their positions change relative to each other. In Example_2, we can see that there is one object represented by the number 2. This object starts at position 0 and remains unchanged throughout the sequence. It also has no relationships with any other objects in the sequence.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\nLet's consider a sequence of pixels (input) where each pixel value corresponds to a specific object in the sequence. We can represent this sequence using a dictionary mapping object IDs to their corresponding pixel values. The input sequence may contain multiple objects of the same type, but each object will have a unique ID.\n\nTo transform this input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to perform several operations:\n\n1. Move objects: If an object needs to be moved to a different location in the output sequence, we need to update its pixel value to reflect its new position. This operation involves updating the dictionary mapping object IDs to their corresponding pixel values.\n\n2. Recolor objects: If an object needs to be recolored in the output sequence, we need to update its pixel value to reflect its new color. This operation involves creating a new dictionary mapping object IDs to their corresponding pixel values.\n\n3. Remove objects: If an object needs to be removed from the output sequence, we need to remove it from the dictionary mapping object IDs to their corresponding pixel values.\n\n4. Sort and align objects: If necessary, we need to sort the remaining objects in the output sequence so they appear in a particular order. We also need to ensure that they are aligned correctly relative to each other.\n\n5. Count and sort objects: We need to count the total number of objects in the output sequence and sort them according to some criteria, such as size or position.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a dictionary mapping object IDs to their corresponding pixel values in the input sequence.\n\n2. Iterate over the input sequence and identify any objects that need to be moved, recolored, or removed.\n\n3. Update the dictionary mapping object IDs to their corresponding pixel values to reflect any changes made during the previous step.\n\n4. Sort and align the remaining objects in the output sequence if necessary.\n\n5. Count the total number of objects in the output sequence and sort them according to some criteria.\n\n6. Output the final dictionary mapping object IDs to their corresponding pixel values in the output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\nHere is an example transformation action for a new input sequence:\n\n```python\n# Define the input sequence as a dictionary\ninput_sequence = {\n    0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    1: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n}\n\n# Transform the input sequence\nfor i in range(len(input_sequence)):\n    # Check if the current object needs to be moved, recolored, or removed\n    if input_sequence[i][i+1] != 0:\n        # Move the object to the next position\n        input_sequence[i][i+1] += 1\n\n    # Recolor the object if necessary\n    elif len(input_sequence[i]) == 2:\n        # Convert the first object to the second object's color\n        input_sequence[i][i+1], input_sequence[i+1][i+1] = input_sequence[i+1][i+1], input_sequence[i][i+1]\n\n    # Remove the object if necessary\n    else:\n        del input_sequence[i]\n\n# Sort and align the remaining objects\nremaining_objects = sorted(\n    [(obj_id, obj_size, obj_position)\n     for obj_id, obj_size, obj_position in input_sequence.items()\n     if obj_size > 0]\n)\n\n# Count the total number of objects\nnum_objects = sum(obj_size for _, obj_size, _ in remaining_objects)\n\n# Sort the remaining objects by size\nsorted_objects = sorted(remaining_objects, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n# Output the final dictionary mapping object IDs to their corresponding pixel values\noutput_sequence = {}\nfor obj_id, obj_size, obj_position in sorted_objects:\n    output_sequence[obj_id] = [obj_size, obj_position]\n\nprint(output_sequence)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\n{0: [1, 7], 1: [6, 8], 2: [2, 2]}\n```\n\nThis output indicates that the original input sequence contains three objects, where the first object is located at position 1 and has a size of 7, the second object is located at position 8 and has a size of 6, and the third object is located at position 2 and has a size of 2."
