prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:
In this problem, we are given an input sequence of pixels represented as a list of integers from 1 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. Our goal is to transform this input sequence into an output sequence using a specific transformation pattern. The transformation pattern involves creating objects out of adjacent pixels of the same color and performing various operations on these objects. These operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, and counting. Additionally, there may be noise pixels present in the input sequence. We need to identify the objects in the input sequence and transform them according to the specified transformation pattern.
Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern for transforming the input sequence into the output sequence involves identifying objects in the input sequence and applying various operations to them. The transformation pattern consists of several steps:

  * Identifying objects: This involves finding groups of adjacent pixels of the same color and treating them as objects.
  * Applying operations: Once the objects have been identified, various operations can be applied to them, including moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, and counting.

Instructions:
To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these instructions:

  1. Identify objects in the input sequence: Look for groups of adjacent pixels of the same color and treat them as objects.
  2. Apply operations to the objects: Depending on the desired outcome, apply various operations to the objects, such as moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, and counting.

Transformation:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:
We can see that the input sequence contains two objects of color 2 (represented by the indices 4 and 5). To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, we will move object 2 to the left one pixel and make it smaller in size. This results in the following output sequence:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Note that the other object remains unchanged in the output sequence.

Transformed Objects:
Objects in the output sequence:

  * Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
  * Object_2: {color: 2, start_index: 6, end_index: 7, size: 1}

Output:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:
The output sequence represents the transformed input sequence after applying the transformation operations mentioned earlier. Specifically, object 2 has been moved to the left one pixel and made smaller in size. The other object remains unchanged in the output sequence.
