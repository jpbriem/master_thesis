            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe overall pattern for these input-output pairs is that each object has been reduced in size by half (i.e., the number of pixels has been halved), while maintaining the same relative position with respect to other objects. This pattern can be described as \"hollow\" or \"scale\".\nTo transform this input into its corresponding output, we need to apply the \"hollow\" operation to each object individually. Specifically, we will reduce the number of pixels per object by half, keeping the same relative positions of the pixels within the object.\nHere's an example of how we can perform this transformation step-by-step:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence: In this case, there are two objects: one at index 1 with a color of 6, and another at index 7 with a color of 6.\n  * Apply the \"hollow\" operation to each object: To do this, we need to reduce the number of pixels per object by half. We can achieve this by dividing the original number of pixels by 2, rounding down to the nearest integer.\n  * Update the object descriptions: After applying the \"hollow\" operation, we can update the object descriptions to reflect the reduced size of the objects. For example, the first object would now be described as follows: {\"color\": 6, \"start_index\": 1, \"end_index\": 3, \"size\": 2}.\n  * Create the output sequence: Finally, we can create the output sequence by applying the same \"hollow\" operation to each object in the input sequence. Here's what the output sequence looks like after applying the transformation:\n```css\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2]\n```\n\nNote that the output sequence has the same structure as the input sequence, but the sizes of the objects have been reduced by half. Also note that the numbers 0 and 6 have remained unchanged in both the input and output sequences, since they represent the background color and the presence of an object, respectively."
