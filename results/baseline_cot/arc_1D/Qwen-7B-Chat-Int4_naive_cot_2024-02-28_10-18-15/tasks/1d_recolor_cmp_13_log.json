            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe input-output pairs provided follow a common pattern where each object has a specific number associated with it (in this case, the number ranges from 0 to 7). In Example_1, the first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 2 with a size of 2, while the second object starts at index 5 and ends at index 6 with a size of 1. In Example_2, the first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 2 with a size of 2, while the second object starts at index 5 and ends at index 6 with a size of 1. In Example_3, the first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 2 with a size of 2, while the second object starts at index 5 and ends at index 6 with a size of 1.\nTo transform the given input into the corresponding output, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the necessary operations to them. Specifically, we can use the numbers associated with each object to determine their size, position, and color. We can then use these properties to transform the objects into their corresponding positions and sizes in the output sequence.\nFor example, in Example_1, the first object should be copied from the input sequence and placed at index 1 in the output sequence with a size of 2. Similarly, the second object should be copied from the input sequence and placed at index 5 in the output sequence with a size of 1.\nOverall Pattern:\nIn this problem, the input-output pairs follow a simple pattern where each object in the input sequence is transformed into its corresponding position and size in the output sequence. The transformation involves copying the objects from the input sequence and placing them in their respective positions in the output sequence.\nInstructions:\nTo transform a new input into its corresponding output, you should follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the numbers associated with each object.\n  2. Use the identified objects to determine their size, position, and color.\n  3. Copy the objects from the input sequence and place them in their corresponding positions in the output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nDescription:\nThe input sequence contains two objects, both starting at index 1 and ending at index 2 with a size of 2. To transform the input into the corresponding output, we copy the first object from the input sequence and place it at index 1 in the output sequence with a size of 2. We also copy the second object from the input sequence and place it at index 5 in the output sequence with a size of 1.\nTest Output:\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
