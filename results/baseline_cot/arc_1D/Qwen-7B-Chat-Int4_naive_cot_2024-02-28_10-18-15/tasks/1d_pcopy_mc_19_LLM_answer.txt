prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, we can see that each object has been copied twice (except for the first one), and their positions have been shifted by two indices.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the objects have been translated horizontally by three indices.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the objects have been translated vertically by two indices.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All examples follow a simple transformation pattern: objects are copied, translated, and scaled. Specifically, objects are copied once or multiple times, then translated horizontally or vertically by a fixed number of indices, and finally scaled up or down by a factor. This pattern does not involve any noise pixels, nor any conditions or arithmetic operations based on objects.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to perform the following steps:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence.
  * Copy each object once or multiple times.
  * Translate each object horizontally or vertically by a fixed number of indices.
  * Scale each object up or down by a factor.

For example, if the input sequence is [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], you could transform it into the output sequence [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] by copying each object twice, translating them horizontally by two indices, and scaling them up by a factor of two.
  * Repeat this process for each object in the input sequence until all objects have been transformed into the desired output sequence.

Note that this transformation pattern involves no noise pixels, nor any conditions or arithmetic operations based on objects. Therefore, there may be multiple valid ways to transform an input into its output, depending on the specific choices made during the transformation process. However, the provided examples show some common patterns that can be used to guide the transformation process. You should try to come up with a solution that matches these patterns as closely as possible, while still producing the correct output sequence for the given input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}
```css
import numpy as np

def transform(input_sequence):
    # Define the transformation function here
    pass

# Test case
input_sequence = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
output_sequence = transform(input_sequence)
print(output_sequence)
```

Note that this code is just a placeholder and needs to be filled in with the actual implementation of the transformation function.
