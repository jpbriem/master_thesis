prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, what changed between the input and output sequences? How did the objects change?', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, what changed between the input and output sequences? How did the objects change?', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, what changed between the input and output sequences? How did the objects change?'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Objects can be moved, scaled, copied, recolored, removed, or hollowed out. They can also be aligned, contain other objects, or overlap with each other. Noise pixels may appear or disappear. Arithmetics based on objects can count, sort, etc.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence, paying attention to their size, position, and color.
  * Determine how you want to modify the objects, such as moving them, scaling them, copying them, recoloring them, removing them, or hollowing them out.
  * Apply the chosen modifications to the objects according to their properties and relationships with each other.
  * Remove any noise pixels from the final result.
  * If necessary, apply arithmetical operations to the objects or the entire sequence.

For example, if you want to move object 1 to the left by one pixel and make it smaller, you would do so by subtracting 1 from its current x-coordinate and reducing its size accordingly. Repeat this process for all objects in the sequence until you achieve the desired output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'In the test case, there is one large object (7) at the center of the sequence. It has no neighbors, but it overlaps with itself in some places. There are several small noise pixels scattered throughout the sequence.', 'transformed_objects': 'Transform the object to make it move to the left by two pixels while maintaining its size and position. Remove any overlapping pixels and replace them with white. Replace the remaining noise pixels with black. Finally, recolor the object to have a light blue color instead of its original dark blue color.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}
