            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe input-output pairs Example_1, Example_2, and Example_3 share a common transformation pattern where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. In this pattern, an object can be moved, hollowed out, scaled, removed, copied, recolored, or contain other objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels present in the input sequence.\nTo transform the given test input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation actions to each object. We also need to account for any noise pixels present in the input sequence.\nHere's one way to approach the problem:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using logic rules. In this case, two objects appear to be present: a large object at the beginning of the sequence (represented by the sequence [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) and a smaller object at the end of the sequence (represented by the sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).\n  2. Apply the appropriate transformation actions to each object. For example, if we want to move the larger object to the left, we could simply shift it over by one pixel. Similarly, if we want to hollow out the larger object, we could remove some of its pixels until it has a specified size.\n  3. Account for any noise pixels present in the input sequence. In this case, there are several pixels that do not belong to any object (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). These pixels should be treated as noise and ignored when identifying objects or applying transformations.\n  4. Create the resulting output sequence by combining the transformed objects with any remaining noise pixels.\n\nUsing these steps, we can create the following output sequence for the given test input sequence:\n\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nNote that the order of the pixels in the output sequence matches the order of the pixels in the input sequence, but the color of each pixel has been modified based on the transformation actions applied to the objects. Specifically, the original large object at the beginning of the input sequence has been shifted to the right and hollowed out, while the small object at the end of the input sequence has remained unchanged."
