            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ \"description\": { \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input sequence contains 8 objects, each represented by a number between 1 and 9. The output sequence has the same numbers but in a different order.

The output sequence also has 8 objects, each represented by a number between 1 and 9. However, the positions of the objects have been swapped. Specifically, the object at index 2 (which was originally in the fourth position) is now in the third position, while the object at index 3 (which was originally in the third position) is now in the fourth position.\" }, \"overall_pattern\": \"All three input-output pairs follow the same transformation pattern. In this pattern, an input sequence is transformed into an output sequence by rearranging the order of the objects in the sequence. Each object can either stay in the same position or be moved to a different position. The position of each object is determined by its original index in the input sequence. For example, if an object's index is 2 in the input sequence, then it will be in the second position in the output sequence. If an object's index is 3 in the input sequence, then it will be in the third position in the output sequence. Finally, the color of each object remains unchanged.\" , \"instructions\": \"To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to first identify the objects in the input sequence. Each object is represented by a number between 1 and 9. Next, you need to determine the position of each object in the output sequence. This is done by using the original index of each object in the input sequence. Finally, you need to rearrange the order of the objects in the output sequence so that they match the order of the objects in the input sequence. You can do this by simply swapping the positions of the objects.\" , \"transformation\": {\"input\": \"[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\", \"object_description\": \"There are eight objects in the input sequence.
