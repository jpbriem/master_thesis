            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has three identical objects (represented by 3s) arranged horizontally, each object occupying two consecutive positions in the sequence. In the output sequence, these three objects are moved vertically so they appear one above another, but still occupy the same positions.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, there is one object (represented by a 2) in the middle of the sequence. In the output sequence, this object is removed, leaving four empty spaces in a row.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, there are three objects (represented by 3s) arranged vertically. In the output sequence, these three objects are moved horizontally so they appear one below another, but still occupy the same positions.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The transformation pattern involves moving objects around within the sequence while maintaining their original positions. This can involve both horizontal and vertical movements.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n  * Identify any objects in the input sequence and note their sizes, positions, and colors.\n  * Determine the desired movement direction and distance for each object.\n  * Move each object according to the specified movement direction and distance, while preserving its original position.\n  * Repeat the process until all objects have been moved to their desired locations.\n  * If any objects need to be removed or replaced, do so accordingly.\n  * Ensure that the resulting output sequence matches the desired output description.\n\nNote that the transformation may involve multiple iterations and adjustments to achieve the desired result.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence and record their sizes, positions, and colors.
