            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: In this example, the input sequence has two objects, one of which is represented by the number 4. The object starts at index 1 and ends at index 5, covering five consecutive elements in the sequence. The other object is represented by the number 0 and covers the rest of the sequence.\n  * Example_2: This example also has two objects, but their positions and sizes differ from those in Example_1. The first object starts at index 4 and ends at index 8, while the second object starts at index 1 and ends at index 6. Both objects cover four consecutive elements in the sequence.\n  * Example_3: In this example, there is only one object, which is represented by the number 3. It covers the entire sequence.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * All three examples share the same transformation pattern, where each input sequence contains multiple objects. Each object has a specific size and position within the sequence, and it can be transformed using various operations such as moving, scaling, removing, etc. The transformation process results in an output sequence that preserves the structure of the input sequence, but may change the appearance of some objects.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n    1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by counting the occurrences of each unique value. Assign each unique value to an object ID, starting from 1.\n    2. Determine the size of each object by counting the number of consecutive elements covered by that object.\n    3. Determine the position of each object by identifying the starting and ending indices of that object.\n    4. Apply any necessary transformations to the objects based on the given instructions. For example, if you need to move an object, adjust its position accordingly.\n    5. Create the output sequence by combining the transformed objects in the order they appear in the input sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Object Description: There are two objects in the input sequence. Object 1 (ID = 1) covers the range from index 1 to index 5, inclusive, and consists of seven consecutive elements with value 7. Object 2 (ID = 2) covers the range from index 6 to index 10, inclusive, and consists of nine consecutive elements with value 0.\n  * Transformed Objects: Move object 1 to index 4 and scale it down by half. Remove object 2 completely.\n  * Output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote: The final output sequence is obtained by applying the transformations specified in the `Transformed Objects` section."
