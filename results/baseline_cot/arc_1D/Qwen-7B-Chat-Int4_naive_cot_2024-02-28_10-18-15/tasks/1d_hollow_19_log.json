            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe underlying transformation pattern involves replacing specific object(s) with another color or value. In Example_1, the object at index 1 (value 3) is replaced with 0, while in Example_2, the object at index 4 (value 5) is replaced with 0. In Example_3, both objects at indices 1 and 6 (values 3 and 0 respectively) are replaced with 0.\nTo transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to replace the specified objects with their replacement color or value. In this case, we can see that the objects at indices 1 and 6 (values 3 and 0 respectively) should be replaced with 0. Therefore, the transformed output sequence would be [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'Replace object at index 1 with 0', 'Example_2': 'Replace object at index 4 with 0', 'Example_3': 'Replace both objects at indices 1 and 6 with 0' }, 'overall_pattern': 'Replace specified objects with their replacement color or value', 'instructions': 'Identify the objects that need to be replaced and their replacement color or value. Replace them accordingly.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided:', 'object_description': 'Describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color:', 'transformed_objects': 'Replace the specified objects with their replacement color or value:', 'output': 'Create the transformed output sequence.'}, 'test_output': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\nNote: This solution assumes that there is only one object per index. If multiple objects could occupy the same index, additional logic would be required to determine which object(s) need to be replaced."
