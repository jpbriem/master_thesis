prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern for this transformation is that each object in the input sequence is replaced by another object of the same color with a different number value. Specifically, if an object has a value of x, it will be replaced by an object with a value of y = (x + 1) % 10. If there are multiple objects of the same color, they will be stacked one above the other.
Instructions:
To transform a new input into its output, you need to follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and size.
  2. Replace each object with another object of the same color but with a different number value. You can do this using the formula y = (x + 1) % 10.
  3. Stack the objects one above the other, starting with the largest object at the bottom.

For example, let's take the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]. We can identify two objects of color 0: one with a value of 0 and another with a value of 4. To replace them, we can use the formula y = (x + 1) % 10. So, the new object with a value of 0 would become y = (0 + 1) % 10 = 1, and the new object with a value of 4 would become y = (4 + 1) % 10 = 5. Then, we can stack the objects one above the other, starting with the largest object at the bottom. This gives us the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0].
Transformation:
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Object Description:
There are three objects in the input sequence:

  * Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
  * Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}
  * Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 3}

In the output sequence, there are also three objects:

  * Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
  * Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}
  * Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 3}

Transformed Objects:
The transformed objects should look exactly the same as the original objects, except for their numbers. In particular, the numbers of the objects should increase by 1 after each replacement. Therefore, the transformed objects in the output sequence should be:

  * Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}
  * Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 3, end_index: 4, size: 2}
  * Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 3}

Note that the start and end indices remain unchanged since they represent the positions of the objects in the input sequence. However, the size of the objects increases because they now contain more digits than before.
Output:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Test Output:
The test output sequence is already provided in the question statement as a numpy array: np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0])
