prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two identical objects at positions 1 and 2, each object has 2 pixels in size. In the output sequence, these objects have been removed and replaced with another object at position 1, this object also has 2 pixels in size.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains one object at position 1 with 8 pixels in size. This object has been moved to position 7 and resized to 8 pixels in size. The remaining part of the input sequence has remained unchanged in the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains one object at position 1 with 3 pixels in size. This object has been copied twice and placed at positions 1 and 6, resulting in two objects with 3 pixels in size. The rest of the input sequence has remained unchanged in the output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Objects can be transformed through various operations such as removal, movement, resizing, copying, recoloring, etc. The number of objects and their properties remain constant across both input and output sequences.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and perform the necessary transformations on them. For example, if there is an object at position 1 with 3 pixels in size, it can be transformed by copying it twice and placing it at positions 1 and 6. Similarly, if there is an object at position 1 with 8 pixels in size, it can be transformed by moving it to position 7 and resizing it to 8 pixels in size. Once all the objects have been transformed, the result will be the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There is one object at position 1 with 3 pixels in size.', 'transformed_objects': 'The object at position 1 should be transformed by copying it twice and placing it at positions 1 and 6, resulting in two objects with 3 pixels in size.', 'output': '[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': '[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}

# Transform the input sequence into the output sequence

input_sequence = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Identify the objects in the input sequence

for i in range(len(input_sequence)):

    transformed_objects.append([obj['start_index'], obj['end_index'], obj['size']])

for obj in transformed_objects:
    # Replace the original object with the transformed objects
    output_sequence[obj[0]:obj[1]] = obj[2]

print(output_sequence)
```

Output:

```
