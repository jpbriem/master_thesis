            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence consists of nine identical objects (represented by the number 2) arranged in a row. In the output sequence, each object has been removed. Specifically, the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth elements of the input sequence have been replaced with zeros.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence consists of three objects (represented by the numbers 0, 8, and 8). In the output sequence, the second object (represented by the number 8) has been moved one space to the left, so it now appears next to the first object instead of after it. Similarly, the third object (also represented by the number 8) has been moved two spaces to the right, so it now appears before the fourth object instead of after it.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'Both Example_1 and Example_2 involve removing or moving objects from an input sequence to create an output sequence. However, there are some key differences between these two patterns. In Example_1, all objects are removed, whereas in Example_2, only one object is moved. Additionally, the positions of the remaining objects may change in Example_2 compared to Example_1. ', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you can follow these steps:\n\n  * Identify any objects in the input sequence that need to be removed or moved.\n  * Determine their new positions if necessary.\n  * Replace or move them accordingly.\n\nFor example, to transform the input sequence [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0] into its output sequence using the pattern from Example_2, you could follow these steps:\n\n  * Remove the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth elements of the input sequence.\n  * Move the second element (represented by the number 3) one space to the left.\n  * Move the third element (also represented by the number 3) two spaces to the right.\n\nAfter completing these steps, the output sequence would be [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0].', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
