            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has four objects, each with size 4x4, positioned at indices (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) and (1,4). The output sequence also has four objects, each with size 6x6, positioned at indices (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) and (2,5). In addition, there is one object with size 9x9, positioned at index (3,3). The other objects remain unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence has three objects, each with size 4x4, positioned at indices (1,1), (1,2) and (1,3).

The other objects remain unchanged.', 'Overall_pattern': 'In both examples, the input and output sequences consist of multiple objects of equal size. Each object is located at a specific position and has a fixed color value. There is no noise present in either the input or output sequences. The transformation involves changing the size and position of some of the objects while leaving others unchanged. There is no arithmetic operation involved. The conditions under which this transformation occurs are not specified.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, you need to change the size and position of some of the objects. Specifically, you can increase the size of an object by multiplying its current width and height by 2, and shifting it horizontally and vertically by half of its current width and height. You can do this for any number of objects, but make sure that the total area of the remaining objects remains constant. You can also leave some objects unchanged. Once you have made these changes, you will get the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided below:', 'object_description': 'Here is a description of the objects in the input sequence:', 'transformed_objects': 'Here is what the transformed objects should look like:', 'output': 'Create the output sequence using the above information:', }, 'test_output': 'np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])'}\n```scss\n# Input sequence\ninput_sequence = np.array([0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\n# Output sequence\noutput_sequence = np.array([0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input sequence contains exactly four objects, each with size 4x4, positioned at indices (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) and (1,4). The output sequence should contain four objects, each with size 6x6, positioned at indices (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) and (2,5). In addition, there should be one object with size 9x9, positioned at index (3,3). If the input sequence does not match this specification, the solution may produce unexpected results."
