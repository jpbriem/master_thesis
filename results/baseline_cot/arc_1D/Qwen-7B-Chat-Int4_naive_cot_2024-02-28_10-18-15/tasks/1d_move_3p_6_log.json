            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence contains many identical objects (represented by the value 2). In the output sequence, these objects are moved one position to the left, effectively removing them from the sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence contains one object (represented by the value 5) that is repeated multiple times. In the output sequence, this object is removed from the sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence contains a single large object (represented by the value 8) that takes up most of the sequence. In the output sequence, this object is split into smaller objects, each taking up less space.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In general, the transformation pattern involves moving, removing, or splitting objects in the input sequence to create the corresponding output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you can follow these steps:\n\n  * Identify any repeating patterns in the input sequence, such as identical objects or repeated objects.\n  * Determine the desired movement or removal of objects, based on the overall pattern.\n  * Apply the necessary transformations to the input sequence to create the corresponding output sequence.\n\nFor example, if there is an identical group of objects in the input sequence, you could move them to the right until they no longer appear together. If there is a repeated object, you could remove it entirely. If there is a large object that takes up most of the sequence, you could split it into smaller objects.\n', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided:', 'object_description': 'Identify any repeating patterns or unique objects in the input sequence:', 'transformed_objects': 'Determine the desired movement or removal of objects based on the overall pattern:', 'output': 'Apply the necessary transformations to the input sequence to create the corresponding output sequence.'}, 'test_output': 'Create the output sequence using the transformations determined above, making sure that the length of the sequence matches the input sequence provided.'}"
