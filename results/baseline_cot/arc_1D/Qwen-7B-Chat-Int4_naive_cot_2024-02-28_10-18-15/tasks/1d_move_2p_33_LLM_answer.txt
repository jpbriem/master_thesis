prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence consists of 18 zeros and two objects of color 2. In the output sequence, there are also 18 zeros but no objects of color 2. This means that the object at index 1 has been removed.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence consists of 18 zeros and one object of color 6. In the output sequence, the object at index 7 has been moved to index 0, while the rest of the elements remain unchanged.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence consists of 18 zeros and three objects of color 0. In the output sequence, the two objects at indices 5 and 6 have been removed, leaving only one object of color 0.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All examples follow the pattern of transforming an input sequence into an output sequence by removing, moving, or scaling objects according to specific conditions. The number of noise pixels remains constant in each example.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, identify any objects present in the input sequence and determine their size, position, and color. Based on these properties, decide whether to remove, move, or scale the objects, and apply the appropriate action accordingly. If necessary, adjust the size, position, or color of the remaining objects to maintain consistency with the overall pattern. Finally, ensure that the output sequence contains the correct number of noise pixels.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the test case:', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence and record their size, position, and color:', 'transformed_objects': 'Based on the properties of the identified objects, determine whether to remove, move, or scale them, and apply the appropriate action:', 'output': 'Create the output sequence by applying the determined actions to the input sequence and ensuring that it contains the correct number of noise pixels:'}, 'test_output': '[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}

Note: The above explanation assumes that the input sequence starts at index 0 and ends at index n-1, where n is the length of the sequence.
