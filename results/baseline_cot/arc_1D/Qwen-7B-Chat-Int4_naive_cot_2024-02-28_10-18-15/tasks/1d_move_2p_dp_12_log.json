            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has a single object of color 3 located at indices 1-2. The output sequence also has a single object of color 3 but it is moved one index to the right and down one index.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has two objects of color 5 located at indices 1-2 and 7-8 respectively. The output sequence has these two objects moved closer together.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the input sequence contains multiple objects of the same color. In each output sequence, there is exactly one object of the same color as in the input sequence. However, the positions of these objects may change relative to their original locations in the input sequence. Additionally, the number of objects in the output sequence can vary depending on the presence of noise pixels and/or arithmetical operations applied to the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color. Each object corresponds to a contiguous group of pixels of the same color.\n  * Move the objects according to their desired positions in the output sequence. This can involve shifting them horizontally, vertically, or both, as well as changing their size.\n  * Remove any unnecessary objects from the output sequence.\n  * Apply any necessary arithmetic operations to the input sequence, such as counting or sorting.\n\nFor instance, in Example_1, the input sequence contains a single object of color 3 located at indices 1-2. To create the output sequence, we would shift this object one index to the right and down one index, resulting in the same object being present at indices 2-3 in the output sequence.\nIn Example_2, the input sequence contains two objects of color 5 located at indices 1-2 and 7-8 respectively. To create the output sequence, we would move these two objects closer together, potentially overlapping or merging them if they happen to occupy the same space in the input sequence. The exact movement required will depend on the desired outcome.\nNote that you do not need to worry about noise pixels or arithmetical operations in this specific task, as they are not mentioned in the provided information. However, they could potentially be relevant to more complex tasks involving image processing or data analysis."
