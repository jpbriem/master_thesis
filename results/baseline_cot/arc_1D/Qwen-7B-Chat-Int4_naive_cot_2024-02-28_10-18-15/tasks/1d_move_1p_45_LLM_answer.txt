prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 and Object_2. Object_1 consists of five pixels of color 0, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2. Object_2 consists of six pixels of color 1, starting at index 4 and ending at index 7.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object: Object_1. Object_1 consists of seven pixels of color 0, starting at index 1 and ending at index 8.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has one object: Object_1. Object_1 consists of six pixels of color 6, starting at index 1 and ending at index 8.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input sequence, there will always be exactly one object. Each object consists of a fixed number of pixels (equal to the number specified in the input), and starts at an arbitrary index within the sequence. The object ends at the next pixel that is not part of the object, or at the last pixel if no such pixel exists.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to perform the following steps:

  * Remove any noise pixels from the input sequence.
  * Determine the position of the object(s) in the input sequence.
  * Recolor the object(s) according to their specified colors.
  * Scale the object(s) as necessary.
  * Move the object(s) to the desired position in the output sequence.

It is important to note that the exact details of these steps may vary depending on the specific input and output sequences being considered. You should carefully consider the requirements of each individual problem before attempting to solve it.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
