prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:

  * Example 1 shows a transformation where an object is copied and recolored. In this case, the original object is located at index 1-2 (with value 8), and the new object has the same size but a different color (value 2). This can be represented using the following steps:
    1. Find the starting and ending indices of the original object.
    2. Create a new object with the same size as the original object and the desired color.
    3. Copy the content of the original object to the new object.
    4. Recolor the new object according to the desired color.

  * Example 2 shows a transformation where an object is moved. In this case, the original object is located at index 5-6 (with value 8), and the new object has been shifted to the right by one position. This can be represented using the following steps:
    1. Find the starting and ending indices of the original object.
    2. Create a new object with the same size as the original object.
    3. Shift the content of the original object to the left by one position and copy it to the new object.

  * Example 3 shows a transformation where two objects are combined into one. In this case, the original objects are located at indexes 1-2 and 7-8 (with values 8 and 9), respectively. These objects are combined into a single object with the value 17. This can be represented using the following steps:
    1. Find the starting and ending indices of each original object.
    2. Combine the content of both objects into a single object with the desired value.
    3. Remove any unnecessary elements from the final object.

Overall Pattern:

  * All three examples demonstrate a common transformation pattern involving copying, recoloring, moving, combining, and removing objects. These operations can be applied to any combination of objects in the input sequence to create the desired output sequence.

Instructions:

  * To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

    1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the provided `object_description` field.
    
    2. Apply the appropriate transformation operation(s) to the identified objects using the provided `transformed_objects` field.
    
    3. Combine the transformed objects into a single output sequence using the provided `output` field.

Transformation:

  * Input: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Object Description: [Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}]
  * Transformed Objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}]
  * Output: [0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0
