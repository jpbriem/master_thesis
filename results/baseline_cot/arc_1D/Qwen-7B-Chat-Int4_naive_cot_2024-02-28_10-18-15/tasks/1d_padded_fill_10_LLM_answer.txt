prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The given input-output pairs follow a specific pattern where the output is obtained by transforming the input object(s) using various operations such as moving, hollowing, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc. Here's an overview of the pattern:

  * Each input sequence has a fixed number of elements (15 in this case).
  * The first element is always 0.
  * The remaining elements represent the positions and colors of pixel objects.
  * The last element is always 4, which corresponds to a noise pixel.
  * The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
  * The first element of the output sequence is always 0.
  * The second element is always the count of non-noise pixels.
  * The remaining elements represent the positions and colors of the transformed pixel objects.
  * The positions of the transformed objects are shifted according to their original positions in the input sequence.
  * The colors of the transformed objects are updated based on the operations performed on them.

To create the test output sequence, we need to apply the appropriate transformations to each object in the input sequence based on its type and properties. We also need to keep track of the total number of non-noise pixels after each operation to ensure that it remains constant. Finally, we can return the transformed output sequence as a numpy array.

For the provided test case, here's the expected output sequence:
```css
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to obtain this output sequence:

  * Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
  * Iterate over each element of the input sequence starting from index 1.
    * If the current element is 0, skip it.
    * Otherwise, check if the current element is a noise pixel (i.e., if its value is 4). If so, increment the `count`.
    * Check if the current element is a pixel object. If so, apply the necessary transformation(s) to it and update its color accordingly.
      * If the current element is a move operation, shift the object's position by subtracting the previous position from the current one.
      * If the current element is a hollow operation, set all pixels in the object's area to 0.
      * If the current element is a scale operation, multiply the object's width and height by the scaling factor.
      * If the current element is a remove operation, delete the object from the input sequence.
      * If the current element is a copy operation, duplicate the object at its current position and update its color.
      * If the current element is a recolor operation, replace the object's color with the specified color.
    * After applying any transformations to the object, increment the `count`.
  * Set the second element of the output sequence to `count`.
  * Iterate over the rest of the input sequence starting from index 2.
    * If the current element is a pixel object, shift its position by subtracting the previous position from the current one.
    * Update its color based on any applicable transformations.
  * Return the output sequence as a numpy array.

Note that this is just one way to implement the transformation pattern, and there may be other approaches depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
