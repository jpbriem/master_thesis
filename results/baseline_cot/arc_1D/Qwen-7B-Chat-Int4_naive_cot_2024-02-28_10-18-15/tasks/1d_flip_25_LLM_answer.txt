prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains 11 occurrences of the value 6. In the output sequence, these occurrences are replaced with the value 5.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains 1 occurrence of the value 6. In the output sequence, this occurrence is replaced with the value 8.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains 1 occurrence of the value 4. In the output sequence, this occurrence is replaced with the value 8.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In all three examples, there is a transformation where one specific value is replaced with another value.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, you need to find the index of each object in the input sequence and replace the value at that index with the desired replacement value. You can then return the modified sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided in the task.', 'object_description': 'The input sequence consists of 11 objects, each of which has a unique color represented by an integer from 1 to 9. The first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 11. All other objects start at index 2 and end at index 10. Each object also has a size, which is determined by the number of consecutive identical values it contains.', 'transformed_objects': 'For each object in the input sequence, find its index using Python's built-in `enumerate` function. Replace the value at that index with the desired replacement value. If no replacement value is specified, leave the value unchanged.', 'output': 'Create the modified sequence by replacing each value in the input sequence with the corresponding replacement value found using the steps above. Return the modified sequence.'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]'}
