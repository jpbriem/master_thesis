prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, we see an object of color 6 surrounded by other objects of color 0. The output sequence shows the same objects but with their positions shifted.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, there are two objects of color 3. The output sequence shows the same objects but with their sizes reduced.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern in these examples is that each input sequence contains one or more objects of the same color, and the output sequence has the same objects but with some changes applied to them. These changes can include shifting, resizing, or changing the color of the objects.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate changes to them according to the pattern seen in the examples. You may need to count the number of objects and check if they fit the desired size and position requirements. If necessary, you can also recolor the objects using the transformation options provided in the instructions.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task and label each object by its color and location.', 'object_description': 'For each object, note its color, starting index, ending index, and size (number of consecutive pixels of the same color). Also note any special properties of the object, such as whether it is hollow or contains another object.', 'transformed_objects': 'Imagine applying the desired changes to the objects. For example, if you want to shift an object, imagine moving it to a new position without changing its color or size. If you want to resize an object, imagine shrinking or expanding it while keeping its color and position constant. If you want to recolor an object, imagine replacing its current color with a new color. Be sure to keep track of any changes made to the objects and update the transformed object descriptions accordingly.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by applying the transformations to the input sequence. Make sure to preserve the original order of the objects and adjust their positions and sizes as needed. Finally, add the remaining zeros at the beginning of the sequence to make it equal to the specified length.'}, 'test_output': 'Here is the expected output sequence for the given input sequence:\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}
