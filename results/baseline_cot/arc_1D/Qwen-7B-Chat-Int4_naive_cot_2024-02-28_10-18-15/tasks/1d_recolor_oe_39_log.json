            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: Each object in the input sequence is replaced by an object of the same color but with a different position in the output sequence. The number of objects in the output sequence is equal to the number of objects in the input sequence. If there is no object at a given index in the input sequence, then it remains unchanged in the output sequence. If there is more than one object at a given index in the input sequence, then the output sequence will contain multiple objects at that index, each having the same color as the corresponding object in the input sequence.\nInstructions: To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for groups of consecutive pixels with the same color. Each group corresponds to an object.\n  2. For each object, determine its size and position in the input sequence.\n  3. Determine the desired size and position for the corresponding object in the output sequence.\n  4. Replace the original object in the input sequence with a new object of the same color and size, positioned according to the desired position in the output sequence.\n  5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all objects have been transformed.\n\nTransformation:\n```css\n{\n    \"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\",\n    \"object_description\": \"There are two objects in this input sequence. One has a size of 8x8 and starts at position (0, 0). The other has a size of 8x8 and starts at position (8, 8).\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"The transformed objects should have the same color as their corresponding objects in the input sequence, but they should be positioned differently. The object that was originally at position (0, 0) should now be positioned at (0, 0), while the object that was originally at position (8, 8) should now be positioned at (0, 7).\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]\"\n}\n```\n\nTest Output:\n```scss\n[\n    [0],\n    [0],\n    [1],\n    [1],\n    [1],\n    [1],\n    [1],\n    [1],\n    [0],\n    [5],\n    [0],\n    [5],\n    [5],\n    [5],\n    [5],\n    [5],\n    [0]\n]\n```"
