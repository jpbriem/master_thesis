            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern:\nThe input-output pairs share a common pattern where the first element of each sequence is always 0 (background color), followed by a sequence of two or more identical numbers representing the object's color. There may be additional noise pixels at the beginning and end of the sequence.\nInstructions:\nTo transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and apply appropriate operations to them. Specifically, we can:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their consecutive identical color values.\n  * Calculate the size of each object by counting the number of consecutive identical color values.\n  * Move the objects along the x-axis according to their size. If an object has a larger size than the width of the sequence, it will be moved to the next row.\n  * Apply any necessary transformations to the objects, such as recoloring or resizing.\n  * Remove any unnecessary objects or noise pixels.\n\nFor example, given the input sequence [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we can identify three objects: one with color 6 and size 3, another with color 8 and size 1, and a third with color 0 and no size. We can then move the objects along the x-axis as follows:\n\n  * Object with color 6 and size 3: move to the next row (x-coordinate = 3)\n  * Object with color 8 and size 1: stay in place (x-coordinate = 4)\n  * Object with color 0 and no size: stay in place (x-coordinate = 0)\n\nFinally, we can recolor the remaining pixels with the color of the last object, which in this case is color 0. This gives us the output sequence [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nTransformed Objects:\nThe transformed objects should maintain the original properties of the objects in the input sequence, including their color, size, and position. However, they may also undergo some changes due to the transformations applied during the process. In particular, the size of the objects may change depending on the available space in the output sequence, and their positions may shift if necessary to avoid overlapping or conflicting with other objects.\nOutput:\nBased on the above instructions and transformed objects, the output sequence for the given input sequence would be [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]."
