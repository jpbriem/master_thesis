prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern: The input sequence contains objects represented by a set of pixels, where each object has a specific color and size. The output sequence also contains objects but with some differences compared to the input sequence. The objects in the output sequence may change their positions, sizes, or colors, or they may disappear altogether. In addition, there may be noise pixels in both the input and output sequences.
Instructions: To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and modify them according to the given transformation pattern. We can do this by iterating over the input sequence and checking if any adjacent pixels have the same color. If so, we can consider these pixels as part of an object and update their properties accordingly. Finally, we can replace the original input sequence with the modified output sequence.
Transformation:

  * Input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Object Description: There are two objects, one with color 1 and another with color 9. Both objects are of size 3x1.
  * Transformed Objects: [Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3x1}, Object_2: {color: 9, start_index: 6, end_index: 8, size: 2x1}]
  * Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Note: The two objects have been moved to the top-left corner of the image, and the second object has been resized to half its original size.

Test Output:
```python
import numpy as np

# Example Test Case
input_sequence = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
output_sequence = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

print("Original Sequence:", input_sequence)
print("Transformed Sequence:", output_sequence)

np.testing.assert_array_equal(output_sequence, np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
```

In summary, the provided input-output pairs follow the same overall pattern, where the objects in the input sequence are transformed into the corresponding objects in the output sequence. The transformation involves moving, resizing, and changing the color of the objects, while removing or adding noise pixels.
