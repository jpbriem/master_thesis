            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: The underlying transformation pattern involves transforming an input sequence of pixels into an output sequence of pixels, where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. The transformation consists of copying, moving, and removing objects. The objects may also be scaled or recolored.\nInstructions: To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Copy the input sequence.\n  2. Identify any objects in the input sequence.\n  3. Move each object according to its position and size.\n  4. Remove any empty space left behind by moved objects.\n  5. Scale or recolor any remaining objects as necessary.\n  6. Repeat steps 2-5 until no more objects can be found.\n\nTransformation: \n\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nDescription: There are two objects in this input sequence: one with color 2 starting at index 1 and ending at index 2 (size 2), and another with color 2 starting at index 7 and ending at index 8 (size 1).\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nDescription: The first object has been copied and moved from index 1 to index 7, so it now starts at index 7 and ends at index 8. The second object has been removed entirely, leaving only the first object in the output sequence.\nTransformed Objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 2}]\nOutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nDescription: The first object has been copied and moved to its final location, while the second object has been removed entirely. The first object now takes up the entire output sequence.\nTest Output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
