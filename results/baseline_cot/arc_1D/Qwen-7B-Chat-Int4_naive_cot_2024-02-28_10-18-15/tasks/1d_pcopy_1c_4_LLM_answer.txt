prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has 15 objects, each object consists of 3 consecutive pixels with value 6. The output sequence also has 15 objects, but they are shifted one pixel towards the right compared to the input sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has 15 objects, each object consists of 3 consecutive pixels with value 6. The output sequence has 17 objects instead, where the last two objects consist of two consecutive pixels with value 0. This means that the objects were split into two separate objects due to the presence of the noise pixel at index 15.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has 15 objects, each object consists of 3 consecutive pixels with value 6. The output sequence has 14 objects instead, since there was an empty space after the last object, so it got removed.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'In all input-output pairs, the transformation involves shifting the objects either horizontally or vertically depending on whether the output sequence contains more or less objects than the input sequence. The number of objects in both the input and output sequences remains constant, except for in Example_2 where the output sequence contains one additional object due to the presence of the noise pixel at index 15. The objects themselves remain unchanged, except for in Example_3 where the last object was removed due to an empty space after it.', ' instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

  1. Identify the number of objects in the input sequence.
  2. Shift each object in the input sequence either horizontally or vertically according to the number of objects in the output sequence.
  3. Remove any empty spaces that may appear after the last object in the input sequence.
  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no empty spaces remain.

For Example_1, the input sequence has 15 objects, each object consisting of 3 consecutive pixels with value 6. To transform this input into its output, we shift each object one pixel towards the right to create 15 objects with the same properties as the original input sequence. In the output sequence, the objects are shifted one pixel towards the right, resulting in a total of 15 objects.
For Example_2, the input sequence has 15 objects, each object consisting of 3 consecutive pixels with value 6. To transform this input into its output, we shift each object one pixel towards the left to create 15 objects with the same properties as the original input sequence. However, the last two objects in the output sequence consist of two consecutive pixels with value 0. This means that the objects were split into two separate objects due to the presence of the noise pixel at index 15. In the output sequence, the objects are shifted one pixel towards the left, resulting in a total of 17 objects.
For Example_3, the input sequence has 15 objects, each object consisting of 3 consecutive pixels with value 6. To transform this input into its output, we shift each object one pixel towards the right to create 15 objects with the same properties as the original input sequence. However, there was an empty space after the last object, so it got removed. In the output sequence, there are now 14 objects, with no empty spaces remaining.
