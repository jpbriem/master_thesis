prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has one object with color 3 and starting index 1 and ending index 2. The output sequence has this same object but with color 3 and size increased by two.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object with color 2 and starting index 1 and ending index 2. The output sequence has this same object but with color 2 and size increased by two.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has one object with color 5 and starting index 1 and ending index 2. The output sequence has this same object but with color 5 and size increased by three.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'All input-output pairs share the same underlying transformation pattern. In each pair, there is at least one object present in both the input and output sequences. The object(s) in the input sequence are unchanged, but their size may increase, decrease, or remain the same depending on the specific transformation rule applied. Additionally, the objects in the output sequence always have the same color as the corresponding object in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

  1. Identify any objects in the input sequence.
  2. Determine the size change for each object (if applicable).
  3. Apply the appropriate transformation rule to each object (e.g., scale, recolor, etc.) to update its size and/or color.
  4. Combine the updated objects into a single output sequence.

For example, if the input sequence contains one object with color 3 and starting index 1 and ending index 2, and the transformation rule is to increase the size by two, then the output sequence would contain the same object but with color 3 and size increased by two. Similarly, if the input sequence contains one object with color 2 and starting index 1 and ending index 2, and the transformation rule is to increase the size by two, then the output sequence would also contain the same object but with color 2 and size increased by two.
Note that the specific transformation rules used will depend on the given input/output pairs and the overall pattern of the transformation. However, the general process outlined above can be applied to any input/output pair to arrive at the correct output sequence. ', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided below:', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions:', 'transformed_objects': 'Apply the appropriate transformation rules to update the sizes and/or colors of the objects:', 'output': 'Combine the updated objects into a single output sequence:'}, 'test_output': '[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]' } }
```scss
# Test Case Input Sequence
input = [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Transformation Steps

# Step 1: Identify Objects
objects = []
for i in range(len(input)):
    if input[i] == 6:
        objects.append({'color': 6, 'start_index': i, 'end_index': i+1, 'size': 1})

# Step 2: Determine Size Change
size_change = True
for obj in objects:
    if obj['size'] != 1:
        size_change = False
        break

# Step 3: Apply Transformation Rules
if size_change:
    # Increase Size of All Objects
    for obj in objects:
        obj['size'] += 1

# Step 4: Combine Updated Objects into Output Sequence
output = []
for i in range(len(input)):
    if input[i] == 6:
        output.extend([6, 6, 6])

# Return Output Sequence
return output
```

Output: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]`
