prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has three objects: two small white objects (objects 1 and 2) and one large black object (object 3). The output sequence also has three objects, but their positions and sizes have been modified compared to the input sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has five objects: four small white objects (objects 1, 2, 3, and 5) and one large black object (object 6). The output sequence also has five objects, but some of them have been removed and their positions and sizes have been modified compared to the input sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has six objects: two small white objects (objects 1 and 2), four large black objects (objects 3, 4, 5, and 7), and one medium gray object (object 8). The output sequence has six objects as well, but their positions and sizes have been modified compared to the input sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern shared by these input-output pairs is that they involve transforming an input sequence into an output sequence through various operations on the objects in the sequence. These operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, and possibly others depending on the specific requirements of each problem instance.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence, determine the desired modifications to their positions and sizes, and apply the appropriate transformation operations accordingly. You can do this step-by-step by examining the input sequence and making note of any patterns or relationships between the objects. Once you have identified the desired modifications, you can apply the necessary transformations to create the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence:', 'transformed_objects': 'Objects 1 and 2 are both small white objects located at indices 1 and 2. Object 3 is a large black object located at index 3.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]'}

Note that the specific details of the transformation will depend on the requirements of each problem instance, so there may be additional steps or considerations involved beyond what is described here.
