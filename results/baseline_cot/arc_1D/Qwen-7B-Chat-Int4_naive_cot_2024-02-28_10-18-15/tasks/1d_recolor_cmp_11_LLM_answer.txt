prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains 16 objects of color 7. In the output sequence, two of these objects (objects 5 and 8) are recolored to color 9.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, one object (object 1) is removed and another (object 4) is recolored to color 9.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, four objects (objects 1, 2, 5, and 6) are recolored to color 9.' }, ' overall_pattern': 'The transformation pattern for this set of examples involves transforming an input sequence into an output sequence through the application of certain operations on the objects within the input sequence. Specifically, objects can be recolored, moved, resized, copied, or deleted, and their positions can also be altered.', ' instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:', ' transformation': {' input': 'Copy the input sequence provided in the task. Make sure to note the sequence length!', ' object_description': 'For each object in the input sequence, identify its size, position, and color. Also note any conditions or constraints that may apply to the object.', ' transformed_objects': 'To transform the objects in the input sequence, you can perform various operations on them. For example, if an object has been recolored, specify the new color. If an object has been moved, specify its new position. If an object has been resized, specify its new size. If an object has been deleted, do not include it in the transformed objects section.', ' output': 'Create the transformed output sequence by applying the transformations specified above to the objects in the input sequence. Be sure to note the sequence length!'}, ' test_output': '[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]' } }
Note that the final output sequence depends on the specific transformations applied to the input sequence.
