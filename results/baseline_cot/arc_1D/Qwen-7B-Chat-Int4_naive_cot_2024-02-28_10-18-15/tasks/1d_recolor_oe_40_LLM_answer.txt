prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, we see that each object has been shifted vertically by one index. Specifically, Object_1 has moved up one index, while Object_2 has moved down one index.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, we see that each object has been horizontally flipped. Specifically, Object_1 has been flipped left-to-right, while Object_2 has been flipped right-to-left.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, we see that each object has been scaled by two. Specifically, Object_1 has been scaled by 2x, while Object_2 has been scaled by 2y.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern here is that each object undergoes some sort of transformation (shifting, flipping, scaling) relative to its position and orientation. These transformations can either involve moving an object up or down, left or right, or changing its size.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you will need to apply the appropriate transformation to each object. This could involve shifting an object up or down, left or right, or scaling it by some factor. You will also need to make sure that the transformed objects do not overlap with any other objects, and that they fit within the bounds of the input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence below:', 'object_description': 'For each object in the input sequence, describe its current position, size, and color:', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the appropriate transformation to each object, describe how the transformed objects should appear:', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence below:', }, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}

# Transformation Instructions:

# Shift Object_1 up one index:

        input[i] = 3

# Flip Object_2 left-to-right:

# Transform the input sequence:

# Create the test output sequence:
output[::2] += 1 # Shift Object_1 up one index
output[::-1] += 1 # Flip Object_2 left-to-right
