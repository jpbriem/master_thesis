            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: The input-output pairs share the same underlying transformation pattern where each object is transformed by moving it horizontally to the right by one index. Additionally, the objects may also be scaled up or down depending on their initial position.\nInstructions: To transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. These are represented by groups of consecutive pixels of the same color.\n  2. Move each object horizontally to the right by one index.\n  3. Scale the objects based on their initial position. If an object starts at the leftmost index, it will remain unchanged. Otherwise, it will be scaled up by a factor of 2. Similarly, if an object ends at the rightmost index, it will remain unchanged. Otherwise, it will be scaled down by a factor of 2.\n  4. Remove any noise pixels (pixels that do not belong to any object).\n\nTransformation: Here's how the transformation would work for the given input sequence:\nInput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nExplanation:\n- The objects in the input sequence are: [Object_1: {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 7, size: 6}]\n- After applying the transformation, we get the following output sequence: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n- Each object has been moved horizontally to the right by one index. In this case, the first object was moved from index 1 to index 7, so its start index became 7 and its end index became 13.\n- Since the objects were initially spread out over several indices, they had to be resized to fit inside a single row. This means that the first object was scaled up by a factor of 2 since it started at the leftmost index, while the second object was scaled down by a factor of 2 since it ended at the rightmost index.\n- Finally, there were no noise pixels present in the input sequence, so none were removed during the transformation.\n\nTest Output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nNote that the output sequence should match the provided description exactly."
