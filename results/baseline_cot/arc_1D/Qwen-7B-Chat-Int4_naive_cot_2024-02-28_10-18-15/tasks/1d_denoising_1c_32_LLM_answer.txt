prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 2 and size 2 starting at index 1 and ending at index 2; Object_2 with color 3 and size 1 starting at index 4 and ending at index 4.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, there is one object: Object_1 with color 4 and size 4 starting at index 1 and ending at index 16.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 5 and size 8 starting at index 1 and ending at index 15; Object_2 with color 5 and size 7 starting at index 17 and ending at index 24.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'In each example, the input sequence contains a series of 1s and 0s representing the pixels of an image. Each object is defined by a range of consecutive 1s, where the color and size of the object can be inferred from the number of consecutive 1s before and after it. The output sequence has the same structure as the input sequence, but with some of the 1s replaced by 0s to indicate the presence of noise pixels. The number of noise pixels in the output sequence is equal to the total number of pixels minus the sum of the sizes of all the objects in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

  1. Identify all the objects in the input sequence using the definition provided in the description.
  2. Calculate the size of each object by counting the number of consecutive 1s before and after it.
  3. Replace any 1s in the input sequence that correspond to an object with a 0 to create the output sequence.
  4. Add an additional 0 at the beginning of the output sequence if necessary to match the length of the input sequence.
  5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 for each object in the input sequence.
  6. Finally, add any remaining noise pixels to the output sequence by replacing any 1s that do not correspond to an object with a 0.

For example, consider the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 3 and size 2 starting at index 1 and ending at index 2; Object_2 with color 3 and size 1 starting at index 4 and ending at index 4. The output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0].
  7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the next example.
  8. Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the final example.

Note that the order of the objects does not matter, as long as they are correctly identified and their sizes are calculated accurately. Also, the number of noise pixels added to the output sequence may vary depending on the input sequence and the objects present in it. However, the overall goal is to produce an output sequence that matches the input sequence in terms of the number of 1s and 0s, while also indicating the presence of objects and noise pixels using the appropriate symbols (0s and 1s).'}
