prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains two objects of color 2. Each object consists of five pixels. In the output sequence, each object has been replaced by an object of color 8, also consisting of five pixels. This means that the entire input sequence has been replaced by an identical sequence, except for the color of the objects.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains four objects of color 2. Two objects consist of six pixels, one object consists of eight pixels, and another object consists of two pixels. In the output sequence, each object has been replaced by an object of color 9, also consisting of the same number of pixels as the original object. This means that the entire input sequence has been replaced by an identical sequence, except for the color of the objects.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains four objects of color 2. One object consists of three pixels, two objects consist of four pixels, and another object consists of seven pixels. In the output sequence, each object has been replaced by an object of color 1, also consisting of the same number of pixels as the original object. This means that the entire input sequence has been replaced by an identical sequence, except for the color of the objects.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In general, the transformation pattern involves replacing objects of a certain color with objects of a different color. This can happen through various operations such as recoloring, scaling, copying, etc., depending on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.', 'instructions': 'To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and then replace them with the desired objects according to the provided transformation pattern. We can achieve this by iterating over the input sequence and applying the appropriate operation to each object.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task description. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'To describe the objects in the input sequence, we need to count the number of pixels in each object and determine their position within the sequence. Additionally, we need to note any special characteristics of the objects, such as whether they are connected to other objects or if they have any particular patterns or shapes. Once we have identified all the objects in the input sequence, we can proceed to transform them according to the provided transformation pattern.', 'transformed_objects': 'To describe how the objects should look like in the output sequence, we need to follow the same process as when describing the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, we need to count the number of pixels in each object and determine their position within the sequence. However, since the objects will now have a different color, we also need to specify the desired color for each object. Additionally, we may want to consider any special characteristics of the objects, such as whether they are connected to other objects or if they have any particular patterns or shapes. Once we have specified the desired properties of the transformed objects, we can proceed to apply the appropriate transformation operations to create the output sequence.', 'output': 'Create the resulting output sequence by applying the appropriate transformation operations to the input sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]'}
```css
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]
```

This is the transformed output sequence obtained by replacing each object of color 2 in the input sequence with an object of color 8. Note that the number of pixels in each object remains unchanged, but the color of the objects has been altered.
