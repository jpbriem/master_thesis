            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe transformation pattern for these examples involves copying objects and changing their color. In Example 1, there is one object with color 3 that is copied twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the sequence. In Example 2, there is an object with color 7 that is copied four times, once at the beginning and three times at the end of the sequence. In Example 3, there are two objects with color 2 that are both copied twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the sequence.\nTo transform the given test case input into its output, we need to follow the same pattern. We can see that there is one object with color 8 that needs to be copied twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the sequence. Additionally, since this is the last example, we can assume that any remaining objects will be noise pixels (with value 0) and do not need to be transformed.\nTherefore, the transformed output should be:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example 1, the object with color 3 was copied twice, once at the beginning and once at the end.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example 2, the object with color 7 was copied four times, once at the beginning and three times at the end.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"In Example 3, the two objects with color 2 were both copied twice, once at the beginning and once at the end.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Objects with color > 0 are copied at the beginning and end of the sequence, while noise pixels with value 0 remain unchanged.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Copy the object with color 8 twice, once at the beginning and once at the end. Leave any remaining noise pixels unchanged.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\",\n        \"object_description\": \"There is one object with color 8 that needs to be copied twice, once at the beginning and once at the end.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that the actual output may vary slightly depending on the implementation of the transformation algorithm."
