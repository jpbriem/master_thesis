prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:

  * Example 1 describes an object where each element in the input sequence corresponds to a pixel in the image. The output sequence has the same number of elements but each element is replaced by the value at the corresponding index in the input sequence. In this case, the input sequence contains 1s, 2s, and 9s representing the pixel colors, and 0s representing the background color. The output sequence also contains 1s, 2s, and 9s, but the values have been replaced by the corresponding pixel values from the input sequence.
  * Example 2 describes another object where each element in the input sequence corresponds to a pixel in the image. However, in this case, some pixels have been removed (hollowed out) from the output sequence. Specifically, any element in the input sequence that appears more than once in the output sequence is removed. In this case, the input sequence contains 1s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 9s, and 2s, and the output sequence contains 1s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, 2s, and 0s.
  * Example 3 describes another object where each element in the input sequence corresponds to a pixel in the image. In this case, the input sequence contains 4s and 6s representing the pixel colors, and 0s representing the background color. The output sequence contains 4s and 6s, but the values have been scaled up so that they are larger than their counterparts in the input sequence. Specifically, any element in the input sequence that appears less than twice in the output sequence is multiplied by two. In this case, the input sequence contains 4s, 4s, 4s, 4s, 4s, 4s, 4s, 4s, 4s, 4s, 4s, 4s, 6s, and 4s, and the output sequence contains 8s, 12s, 12s, 12s, 12s, 12s, 12s, 12s, 12s, 12s, 12s, 12s, 12s, and 0s.

Overall Pattern:

  * The overall pattern shared by these examples is that the input and output sequences contain the same number of elements, and each element in the input sequence corresponds to a pixel in the image. The output sequence replaces or scales the pixel values in the input sequence according to certain rules that depend on the specific transformation being applied.

Instructions:

  * To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation rule to them. For example, if there is an object that represents a pixel with the value 2, then you can replace it with the corresponding value from the input sequence. If there is an object that represents a pixel with the value 6, then you can multiply it by two. You may also need to apply additional rules to handle noise pixels or arithmetical operations involving multiple objects.
  * Once you have identified the objects in the input sequence and applied the appropriate transformation rules, you can create the corresponding output sequence by replacing or scaling the pixel values in the input sequence. Make sure that the output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence, and that each element in the output sequence corresponds to a pixel in the image.

Transformation:

  * Input: [9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Object Description: This object consists of one large square containing nine 9s, and one small square containing three 9s.
  * Transformed Objects: This object should still consist of one large square containing nine 9s, and one small square containing three 9s, but the values in the squares should have been replaced by the corresponding values from the input sequence.
  * Output: [9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 9,
