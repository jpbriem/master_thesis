            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe given examples demonstrate an interesting pattern where the input sequence contains a large number of identical pixels (objects), and the output sequence has a similar structure but with some of the objects removed or replaced with other objects. This suggests that there may be a way to transform the input sequence into the output sequence by removing or replacing certain objects based on their properties.\nTo transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we can follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using object detection techniques such as thresholding or connected component analysis.\n  2. Determine the properties of each object, including its size, position, and color.\n  3. Remove or replace objects based on their properties. For example, if an object has a small size and is located far away from other objects, it may be safe to remove it without affecting the overall structure of the image.\n  4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the desired output sequence is obtained.\n\nFor the given test case, we can see that there are two large objects at the center of the image with a size of 8x8. One of them is black, while the other one is white. We can transform the input sequence into the output sequence by removing the black object, leaving only the white object.\nHere's the transformation process:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using thresholding: we can set a threshold value of 50% to identify the objects. The result will be a binary image where the white pixels represent the objects and the black pixels represent the background.\n  2. Determine the properties of each object: we can count the number of white pixels in each object and measure their average position. In this case, there are two objects with a total of 72 white pixels and a center position of (4, 4).\n  3. Remove or replace objects based on their properties: since both objects have the same size and location, we can simply remove the black object to obtain the output sequence. The final output sequence will contain only the white object with a size of 8x8.\n  4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the desired output sequence is obtained: we can repeat steps 1-3 with other input sequences to obtain different output sequences depending on the properties of the objects in the input sequence.\n\nIn conclusion, the transformation pattern involves identifying the objects in the input sequence, determining their properties, and removing or replacing them based on those properties. The resulting output sequence should have the same structure as the input sequence, except for the presence or absence of certain objects."
