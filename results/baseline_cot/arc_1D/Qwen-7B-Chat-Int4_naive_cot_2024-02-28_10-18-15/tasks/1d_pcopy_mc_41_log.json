            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has 2 objects: Object_1 with color 2 at index (1, 2), size 2 and Object_2 with color 3 at index (4, 4), size 1.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has 2 objects: Object_1 with color 9 at index (1, 2), size 2 and Object_2 with color 8 at index (4, 4), size 1.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has 2 objects: Object_1 with color 3 at index (1, 2), size 2 and Object_2 with color 7 at index (4, 4), size 1.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In all examples, the input sequence has two objects. Each object consists of a specific color and size. The objects can overlap and touch each other. The objects are arranged in a specific order according to their start indices.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the necessary transformation actions. In general, you can perform the following steps:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for adjacent pixels of the same color. Each object corresponds to one or more consecutive pixels of the same color.\n  * Apply transformation actions to the identified objects. These actions include moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc.\n  * Arrange the modified objects in the output sequence according to their original positions.\n\nFor Example_1, the transformation action would be to move Object_1 to the right by one pixel, leaving Object_2 unchanged. The resulting output sequence would then be [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].'}, 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

The objects can overlap and touch each other, but they cannot be merged. The objects are arranged in a specific order according to their start indices. To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the necessary transformation actions. We can do this by using image processing techniques such as thresholding, edge detection, and contour extraction. Once we have identified the objects, we can modify them using various transformation actions such as translation, rotation, scaling, and cropping. Finally, we can arrange the modified objects in the output sequence according to their original positions."
