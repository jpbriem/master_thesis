            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe overall pattern of these input-output pairs is that each object in the input sequence is replaced with an object in the output sequence, but with some modifications. Specifically, if two objects touch each other in the input sequence, they will also touch each other in the output sequence. However, if one object completely covers another in the input sequence, it will be removed in the output sequence. Additionally, any object with a value of 0 in the input sequence will be filled with a background color (0) in the output sequence.\nTo transform this input into its corresponding output, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and modify them according to the above pattern. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are three objects: [Object_1: {color: 3, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 4}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 10, end_index: 13, size: 3}, Object_3: {color: 3, start_index: 16, end_index: 19, size: 4}].\n  2. Modify the objects according to the pattern described above. To replace Object_1 with Object_2, we can shift Object_2 down by 1 index so that it starts at the same location as Object_1. Similarly, we can shift Object_3 up by 1 index so that it ends at the same location as Object_2. This gives us the modified objects: [Object_1: {color: 3, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 6, end_index: 9, size: 3}, Object_3: {color: 3, start_index: 8, end_index: 12, size: 4}]. Note that Object_3 now overlaps with Object_2.\n  3. Fill in the remaining background color (0) using the appropriate objects. In this case, since there are no more objects left, we simply leave the last four indices (end_index = 19) empty.\n  4. Create the final output sequence by concatenating the modified objects together. This gives us the desired output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nTherefore, the test case input sequence should be transformed into the following output sequence: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]."
