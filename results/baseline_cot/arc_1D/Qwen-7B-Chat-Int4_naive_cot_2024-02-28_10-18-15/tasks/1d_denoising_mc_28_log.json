            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe transformation pattern in these examples is related to the removal of noise pixels (represented by 0) and the replacement of them with other pixels (represented by 9). Specifically, each object in the input sequence corresponds to a group of consecutive 9s, and the output sequence contains only 9s where there were previously 0s.\nTo transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to iterate through the input sequence and replace any 0s with 9s. This can be done using a simple loop and an if statement to check if the current element is a 0. If it is, we can replace it with a 9. Here's the code to do this:\n```python\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    # Iterate through the input sequence\n    for i in range(len(input_sequence)):\n        # Check if the current element is a 0\n        if input_sequence[i] == 0:\n            # Replace it with a 9\n            input_sequence[i] = 9\n    \n    return input_sequence\n```\n\nUsing this function, we can transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n```scss\ninput_sequence = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_sequence = transform(input_sequence)\nprint(output_sequence)  # Output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n```\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]`. Note that since the input sequence has only 9s and 0s, the output sequence will also only contain 9s."
