            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has 25 pixels, while the output sequence also has 25 pixels.

The objects in the input sequence can be moved, resized, recolored, or removed entirely. In some cases, multiple objects may be combined into a single larger object, or a new object may appear where previously no object was present. The transformation process involves identifying and manipulating the relevant objects in the input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation operations to them. Here is an example of how this could be done for the given input sequence:\n\n  * Identify the two objects in the input sequence: Object 1 starts at index 1 and ends at index 6, Object 2 starts at index 7 and ends at index 12. These objects are represented by the indices 1 through 6 and 7 through 12 respectively.\n  * Apply the necessary transformation operations to these objects. In this case, we want to combine Object 1 and Object 2 into a single object. To do this, we can simply concatenate the corresponding pixels together using the `numpy.concatenate()` function.\n  * Repeat steps 1 and 2 for any additional objects in the input sequence, applying the appropriate transformation operations to each object as required.\n  * Once you have applied all the necessary transformation operations to the input sequence, you will have produced the corresponding output sequence.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific transformation operations that are used will depend on the details of the input and output sequences, as well as the desired outcome of the transformation process. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully analyze the input and output sequences and understand the intended meaning behind each transformation operation before attempting to implement it.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task.

For example, if an object in the input sequence needs to be moved or resized, then you would need to adjust the coordinates and dimensions of the corresponding object in the output sequence accordingly.', 'output': 'Create the output sequence by applying the necessary transformation operations to the input sequence. Make sure that the resulting sequence has the correct number of pixels and contains the correct objects in the correct positions, with the correct sizes and colors.', }, 'test_output': 'Here is an example of what the transformed output sequence might look like for the given input sequence:\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}"
