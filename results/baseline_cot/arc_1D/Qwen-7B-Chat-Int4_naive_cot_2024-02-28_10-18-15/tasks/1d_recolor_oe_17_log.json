            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe transformation pattern shared by these examples involves removing some of the background pixels while preserving the objects' positions and colors. In Example 1, four background pixels were removed, resulting in eight objects. In Example 2, seven background pixels were removed, resulting in six objects. And in Example 3, nine background pixels were removed, resulting in five objects.\nTo transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can follow these steps:\n\n  1. Remove all the background pixels except the last one.\n  2. Sort the remaining pixels by their position.\n\nHere's the resulting output sequence:\n[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\nNote that this sequence has eight objects instead of the original ten because two background pixels were removed. Also, the order of the remaining pixels has been sorted.\nOverall Pattern:\nIn each example, the input sequence contains a set of objects, where each object consists of a number of pixels arranged in a specific pattern. To generate the output sequence, we need to perform several operations on the input sequence, including removing background pixels and sorting the remaining pixels. The exact details of these operations depend on the specific transformation pattern used in each example. However, in general, the goal is to preserve the structure and appearance of the objects in the input sequence while modifying the background pixels to create the desired output sequence."
