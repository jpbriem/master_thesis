prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has 17 zeros followed by two groups of 8 ones, each group separated by one zero. In the output sequence, the first 17 zeros remain unchanged, but the second group of 8 ones is replaced by another group of 8 ones, also separated by one zero.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has 10 sixes followed by two groups of four zeros, each group separated by one six. In the output sequence, the first 10 sixes remain unchanged, but the second group of four zeros is replaced by another group of four zeros, also separated by one six.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has 17 zeros followed by one group of five ones, then another group of five fours, both separated by one zero. In the output sequence, the first 17 zeros remain unchanged, but the second group of five ones is replaced by another group of five fours, also separated by one zero.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the input sequence is split into two or more segments, where each segment contains a specific number of identical pixels (e.g., 8 ones, 4 zeros). The output sequence replaces these segments with other segments containing a different number of identical pixels, often arranged differently. This pattern can be explained using the following steps:', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the test case.', 'object_description': 'Identify the distinct segments in the input sequence and their lengths. Each segment will contain a specific number of identical pixels.', 'transformed_objects': 'Replace each segment with a new segment containing a different number of identical pixels, arranged differently if necessary. Make sure the new segments do not overlap with existing segments or contain any non-zero pixels outside of the original segments.', 'output': 'Create the final output sequence by concatenating the transformed segments together. Make sure the resulting sequence is exactly the same length as the input sequence.'}, 'test_output': 'numpy.array([0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])' }
