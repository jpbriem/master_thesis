            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ \"description\": { \"Example_1\": \"In Example 1, the input sequence contains 8 identical black pixels, followed by one white pixel at index 7. The output sequence has the same arrangement of black and white pixels, but the white pixel at index 7 is replaced with another white pixel at index 0.\", \"Example_2\": \"In Example 2, the input sequence contains 8 identical black pixels, followed by two white pixels at indices 7 and 8. The output sequence removes both white pixels at these indices, leaving only black pixels.\" }, \"overall_pattern\": \"The overall pattern in these examples is that each object (in this case, a single pixel) can be either removed, moved, or copied. When an object is removed, it leaves behind any other objects that were touching it. When an object is moved, it changes its position within the sequence without changing its color. When an object is copied, a duplicate of the original object appears at a new location within the sequence.\" , \"instructions\": \"To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n  * Identify all objects in the input sequence. In this case, there is only one object, which consists of the entire input sequence.\n  * Determine what action needs to be taken for each object. In this case, the object needs to be removed since we want to create the output sequence with no white pixels.\n  * Apply the determined action to the object. In this case, we simply delete the object from the input sequence.\n\nRepeat these steps for all objects in the input sequence to obtain the final output sequence.\" , \"transformation\": {\"input\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\", \"object_description\": \"There is only one object in the input sequence, which consists of the entire sequence.\", \"transformed_objects\": \"Remove the object\", \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\" } , \"test_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\" }\nNote: The test case provided does not match the overall pattern specified in the description. It seems to involve removing multiple objects instead of just one. Please provide a valid test case that matches the specified pattern."
