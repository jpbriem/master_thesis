prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has two identical blocks of object 2 (represented by 2s) separated by an object 0 (represented by 0). In the output sequence, these blocks are horizontally aligned and joined together.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence consists of one large block of object 5 (represented by 5s), surrounded by 0s. In the output sequence, this block is vertically aligned and split into two equal parts.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Objects can be moved, resized, copied, recolored, removed, or combined. The background color is always 0. The objects must be horizontally aligned if they are adjacent. If there is a gap between them, it will be filled with 0s. Objects must also be vertically aligned if they are adjacent. If there is a gap between them, it will be filled with 0s. The number of objects in the output sequence must match the number of objects in the input sequence. Each object in the output sequence must correspond to exactly one object in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to perform the following steps:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence. These are represented by contiguous groups of pixels with the same color.
  * Move each object to its desired location in the output sequence.
  * Resize each object to its desired size in the output sequence.
  * Recolor each object to its desired color in the output sequence.
  * Remove any objects that do not appear in the output sequence.
  * Copy and paste any remaining objects to create the final output sequence.

For example, in Example 1, we can identify two objects: one consisting of three 2s and another consisting of two 2s. We can move both of these objects to their desired locations in the output sequence (in this case, horizontally aligned at the center of the image). We can then resize both objects to the same size (in this case, half the width of the image). Finally, we can recolor both objects to white (since they represent the background color in the output sequence).
In Example 2, we can identify one large object consisting of six 5s and four 0s. We can move this object to its desired location in the output sequence (vertically aligned at the center of the image). We can then resize this object to the same height as the original image. Finally, we can recolor this object to black (since it represents the background color in the output sequence).

Note that the order of operations does not matter - you can perform any combination of these steps to arrive at the correct solution.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regard the test input sequence as a set of objects, where each object is defined by a contiguous group of pixels with the same color.', 'transformed_objects': 'Transform each object according to the given instructions. Pay attention to the desired positions, sizes, and colors of the objects.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence.

Fill any gaps between objects with 0s. Horizontal and vertical alignments should be preserved if applicable.', 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format.
