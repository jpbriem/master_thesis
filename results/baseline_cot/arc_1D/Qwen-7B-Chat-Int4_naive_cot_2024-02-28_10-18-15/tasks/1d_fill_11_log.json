            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains many zeros and one non-zero value. The output sequence has an additional object at index 7, which is made up of two consecutive non-zero values.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence consists of five copies of a single value (5). The output sequence is identical to the input sequence but with each value replaced by the original value.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains a single object (a group of three consecutive ones), while the output sequence contains four objects, each consisting of a group of three consecutive ones.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The input-output patterns involve transforming sequences of pixels into sequences of objects, where each object is defined as a group of adjacent pixels having the same color. The transformation involves creating new objects or modifying existing ones, either by adding or removing pixels, or changing their color. The output sequence may contain more or fewer objects than the input sequence, depending on the transformation applied.', 'instructions': 'To transform a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation operations. In general, you can follow these steps:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence using the `object_description` field.\n  * Apply the appropriate transformation operations to create or modify the objects in the output sequence using the `transformed_objects` field.\n  * Check that the output sequence contains the correct number of objects and has the desired properties using the `output` field.\n\nFor example, if the input sequence contains three consecutive ones, you could create a new object containing those three pixels in the output sequence. If the input sequence contains a single object made up of ten consecutive ones, you could add another nine consecutive ones to create a second object.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
