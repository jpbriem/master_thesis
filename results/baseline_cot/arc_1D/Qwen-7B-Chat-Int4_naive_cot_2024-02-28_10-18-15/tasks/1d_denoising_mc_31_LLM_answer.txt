prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_sequence):
    # Check if there are any objects in the input sequence
    num_objects = sum(1 for i in input_sequence if i != 0)
    
    # If there are no objects, return the original input sequence
    if num_objects == 0:
        return input_sequence
    
    # Find the object in the input sequence that corresponds to the object in the output sequence
    obj_start_index = None
    obj_end_index = None
    for i, val in enumerate(input_sequence):
        if val == 0:
            continue
        
        # If we find the starting index of the object, check if it also includes the ending index
        if obj_start_index is None and val == output_sequence[obj_start_index]:
            obj_start_index = i
        elif obj_start_index is not None and val == output_sequence[obj_end_index]:
            obj_end_index = i
            
        # If we find both the starting and ending indices of the object, break out of the loop
        if obj_start_index is not None and obj_end_index is not None:
            break
    
    # If we didn't find the object, raise an error
    if obj_start_index is None or obj_end_index is None:
        raise ValueError("Could not find the object in the input sequence")
        
    # Replace the elements in the input sequence corresponding to the object in the output sequence with the corresponding elements in the output sequence
    output_sequence = np.array(output_sequence)
    input_sequence[obj_start_index:obj_end_index] = output_sequence[obj_start_index:obj_end_index]
    
    return input_sequence
```

Note that this code assumes that the output sequence is stored as a numpy array. If the output sequence is stored differently, you may need to modify the code accordingly. Additionally, this code assumes that the output sequence has exactly one object, and that the object is represented by a contiguous range of elements in the input sequence. If the output sequence has multiple objects or if the objects are not represented by contiguous ranges of elements, you may need to modify the code accordingly. Finally, this code does not handle cases where the input sequence is empty, so you may want to add additional checks to handle these cases.
