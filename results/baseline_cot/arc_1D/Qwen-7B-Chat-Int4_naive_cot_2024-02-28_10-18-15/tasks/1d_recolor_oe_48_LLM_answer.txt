prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Sample Outputs:
Description:
Example_1: In this example, the object at index 1 has been moved one position to the right. The object at index 8 has been removed. This resulted in the creation of two new objects at indices 7 and 6. These new objects have the same size and color as their original counterparts, but they have been placed differently.
Example_2: In this example, the object at index 1 has been scaled down by half. The object at index 8 has been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. The result is the same as Example_1, except that the objects have been resized and rotated instead of being simply moved and removed.
Overall Pattern:
In both examples, there is a simple transformation rule that involves moving, removing, and resizing objects. Specifically, an object can be moved by changing its position by a specified number of positions (in either direction), removed by deleting it from the input sequence, and resized by scaling it up or down by a specified factor. Rotating an object by a specified angle also counts as a type of resizing.
Instructions:

  * To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, you need to follow these steps:
    1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. Each object is represented by a range of consecutive elements in the input sequence.
    2. Move each object by changing its position by a specified number of positions (in either direction). If an object is moved outside the input sequence, make sure to wrap it around back to the beginning.
    3. Remove any objects that are no longer present in the output sequence.
    4. Resize any remaining objects by scaling them up or down by a specified factor. Make sure to adjust the position of the object so that it still fits inside the input sequence.
    5. Rotate any remaining objects by a specified angle. Make sure to adjust the position of the object so that it still fits inside the input sequence.
  * To create the resulting test output sequence, you need to follow these steps:
    1. Copy the input sequence from the task description.
    2. Move each object by changing its position by a specified number of positions (in either direction).
    3. Remove any objects that are no longer present in the output sequence.
    4. Resize any remaining objects by scaling them up or down by a specified factor.
    5. Rotate any remaining objects by a specified angle.
    6. Return the resulting test output sequence as a numpy array.

Transformation:
Input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
Output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
Transformed Objects: [Object_1: {color: 5, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 1}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}]
Output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
Note that the transformed objects are the same as those in the output sequence, but the positions of the objects have been adjusted to match the transformed input sequence.
