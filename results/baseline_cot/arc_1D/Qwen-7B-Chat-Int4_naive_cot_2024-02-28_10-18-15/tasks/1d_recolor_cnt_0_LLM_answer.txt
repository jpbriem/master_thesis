prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
output: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The input-output pairs provided follow a simple transformation pattern where adjacent pixels of the same color represent an object, and the value of each object is determined by its position within the sequence. In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects, one at index 1-2 (with color 2) and another at index 7-8 (with color 2). The output sequence removes the second object and replaces it with an object at index 1-2 (with color 8).
In Example_2, the input sequence has three objects, one at index 1-2 (with color 2), one at index 6-7 (with color 2), and another at index 9-10 (with color 2). The output sequence removes the middle object and replaces it with an object at index 1-2 (with color 8) and an object at index 6-7 (with color 5).
In Example_3, the input sequence has four objects, one at index 1-2 (with color 2), one at index 5-6 (with color 2), one at index 9-10 (with color 2), and another at index 12-13 (with color 2). The output sequence removes the third and fourth objects and replaces them with an object at index 1-2 (with color 8) and an object at index 9-10 (with color 5).
To transform this test case input sequence into its test output sequence, we can follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: We can see that there are six objects in the input sequence, one at index 1-2 (with color 2), one at index 4-5 (with color 2), one at index 7-8 (with color 2), one at index 9-10 (with color 2), one at index 12-13 (with color 2), and one at index 14-15 (with color 2).
  2. Remove any duplicate objects: Since there are no duplicates in the input sequence, we do not need to perform any further action here.
  3. Replace objects with their corresponding output values: We can replace the objects in the input sequence with their corresponding output values. For example, we can replace the object at index 1-2 with an object at index 1-2 with color 8, and replace the object at index 9-10 with an object at index 9-10 with color 5. This will give us the following output sequence: [0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0].
  4. Check if the output sequence has the correct length: The output sequence should have the same length as the input sequence. In this case, both the input and output sequences have 16 elements, so we do not need to take any further action here.

Therefore, the test output sequence for this test case input sequence is [0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0].
