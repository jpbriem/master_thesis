prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
output: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:

  * Example 1: In this example, we can see that the object at index 1 has been moved horizontally by one pixel, and the object at index 6 has been removed. Additionally, the object at index 7 has been resized, and the object at index 8 has been hollowed out.
  * Example 2: In this example, the object at index 5 has been copied twice, and the object at index 10 has been recolored.
  * Example 3: In this example, the objects at indices 1 and 12 have been moved together, and the object at index 13 has been removed. Additionally, the objects at indices 2 through 11 have been resized, and the objects at indices 14 through 17 have been hollowed out.

Overall Pattern:

  * Each object in the input sequence corresponds to an object in the output sequence.
  * Objects can be moved, resized, hollowed out, copied, recolored, or removed.
  * Objects can overlap, contain, or touch each other.
  * No noise pixels are present in either the input or output sequences.
  * Arithmetic operations can be performed on objects (e.g., counting, sorting).

Instructions:

  * To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine what action needs to be taken on them.
  * If an object needs to be moved, you need to specify its starting and ending indices and the direction of movement (i.e., left, right, up, down).
  * If an object needs to be resized, you need to specify its current size and the desired new size.
  * If an object needs to be hollowed out, you need to specify the number of pixels that should be removed from the object's interior.
  * If an object needs to be copied, you need to specify where the copy should be placed in the output sequence.
  * If an object needs to be recolored, you need to specify the new color value.
  * If an object needs to be removed, you do not need to take any action.

Transformation:

  * Input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Object Description: There are three objects in the input sequence: Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3.
  * Transformed Objects: Object_1 should be moved two pixels to the right, Object_2 should be resized to half its current size, and Object_3 should be hollowed out completely.
  * Output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test Output:

  * Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Note that the sequence length may change depending on the specific actions taken on the objects. Here is an example output sequence:

    ```
    [[0, 3],
     [3, 3],
     [3, 3],
     [3, 3],
     [3, 3],
     [3, 3],
     [2, 0],
     [0, 0],
     [0, 0],
     [2, 2],
     [2, 2],
     [2, 2],
     [2, 2],
     [2, 0],
     [0, 0],
     [0, 0]]
    ```
