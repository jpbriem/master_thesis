            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: The input sequence consists of 16 black pixels arranged in two rows of eight pixels each. The output sequence has the same structure but the value of the second row's fifth pixel (index 9) has been replaced with a white pixel (value 1). This change transforms the object in the input sequence with index 9 into an object with a different color in the output sequence.\n  * Example_2: The input sequence consists of 16 black pixels arranged in four columns of four pixels each. The output sequence has the same structure but the value of the fourth column's third pixel (index 12) has been replaced with a white pixel (value 1). This change transforms the object in the input sequence with index 12 into an object with a different color in the output sequence.\n  * Example_3: The input sequence consists of 16 black pixels arranged in five rows of four pixels each. The output sequence has the same structure but the value of the fifth row's sixth pixel (index 20) has been replaced with a white pixel (value 1). This change transforms the object in the input sequence with index 20 into an object with a different color in the output sequence.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * Each input sequence corresponds to a specific configuration of objects in a grid. The output sequence is obtained by transforming some of these objects in the input sequence using simple operations such as changing their color or moving them to a different location.\n  * The number of objects in the input sequence determines the number of objects in the output sequence, and the positions and sizes of the objects in the input sequence determine the positions and sizes of the corresponding objects in the output sequence.\n  * The transformation pattern involves applying simple operations to individual objects in the input sequence to create the corresponding objects in the output sequence.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n    1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by counting the number of occurrences of each unique color.\n    2. Determine the positions and sizes of the objects in the input sequence by identifying the indices and ranges of the objects' colors.\n    3. Apply the appropriate transformation operation to each object in the input sequence according to the transformation pattern. For example, if you want to replace the color of an object with a different color, simply assign the new color value to the object's corresponding index in the output sequence.\n    4. Repeat steps 2-3 until all objects in the input sequence have been transformed into corresponding objects in the output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output:\n\n  * Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Note that the number of elements in the input sequence and the output sequence should be equal."
