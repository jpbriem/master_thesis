prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects, each consisting of 8 identical pixels of color 2. The output sequence has the same number of objects but their sizes differ. The first object consists of 12 pixels (size 2x2) while the second one consists of 8 pixels (size 1x8).'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern in these examples is that an input sequence can consist of multiple objects, where each object can be moved, scaled, rotated, or colored differently. In some cases, the objects may also overlap or contain other objects.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the necessary transformations to them. You can do this by analyzing the size, position, and color of the pixels in the input sequence. Once you have identified the objects, you can then apply the desired transformations to them. If there are any overlapping or contained objects, you will need to take those into account as well.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there are three objects: Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3. Object_1 consists of 5 pixels of color 3 at position [0, 0]. Object_2 consists of 5 pixels of color 3 at position [0, 1]. Object_3 consists of 5 pixels of color 3 at position [1, 0].', 'transformed_objects': 'The transformed objects should be arranged in the same order as they appear in the input sequence. Object_1 should now be located at position [0, 1], Object_2 should now be located at position [0, 0], and Object_3 should now be located at position [1, 1]. Each object should still consist of 5 pixels of color 3. ', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': '[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0]'}
```css
# Transformation steps:

# Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence

# Object 1: At position [0, 0], 5 pixels of color 3
# Object 2: At position [0, 1], 5 pixels of color 3
# Object 3: At position [1, 0], 5 pixels of color 3

# Step 2: Apply the necessary transformations to each object

# Object 1: Move it to position [0, 1]
# Object 2: Move it to position [0, 0]
# Object 3: Move it to position [1, 1]

# Step 3: Arrange the transformed objects in the same order as they appear in the input sequence

# Output sequence: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0]
