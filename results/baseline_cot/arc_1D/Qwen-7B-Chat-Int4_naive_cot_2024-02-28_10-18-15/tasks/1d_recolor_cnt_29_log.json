            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains two objects, each represented by three consecutive pixels. The output sequence has one object that covers the entire input sequence. The size of both objects is four pixels.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains three objects, each represented by two consecutive pixels. The output sequence has one object that covers the entire input sequence.

The output sequence has one object that covers the entire input sequence. The size of all objects is nine pixels.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern in these examples is that the input sequence consists of multiple objects, where each object is represented by a set of pixels. In the output sequence, the objects are transformed according to a specific rule. This rule can involve moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc. The final result is an image that consists of one or more objects, where each object takes up the entire input sequence and is transformed accordingly. The size of each object corresponds to the number of pixels used to represent it in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions. Once you have this information, you can apply the appropriate transformation rule to create the output sequence. For example, if there are two objects in the input sequence and they are both represented by three consecutive pixels, then the output sequence will contain one object that covers the entire input sequence, using the same number of pixels as the original objects. If there are multiple objects in the input sequence, then you may need to combine them into a single object before applying the transformation rule. Finally, make sure that the size of each object in the output sequence matches the size of the corresponding object in the input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided above into a separate variable.', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions.

Make sure that the size of each object in the output sequence matches the size of the corresponding object in the input sequence.

Finally, ensure that the objects are properly aligned and positioned in the output sequence.', 'output': 'Create the output sequence by applying the transformation rule to the input sequence.
