            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has one object consisting of three pixels of color 0, starting at index 5 and ending at index 8. This object is surrounded by six background pixels of color 0. In the output sequence, this object has been removed, leaving behind two background pixels of color 0.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object consisting of four pixels of color 4, starting at index 6 and ending at index 9. This object is surrounded by five background pixels of color 0. In the output sequence, this object has been moved to the right, and its size has increased to cover the entire width of the image.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence consists of two objects: an object consisting of three pixels of color 1, starting at index 1 and ending at index 3, and another object consisting of seven pixels of color 9, starting at index 7 and ending at index 13. These objects are separated by one background pixel of color 0. In the output sequence, these objects have been moved closer together, with the second object overlapping slightly with the first.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'In each example, there is exactly one object in the input sequence. The object has some number of pixels of color 0 (background), followed by some number of pixels of a different color. There may also be additional background pixels surrounding the object. The output sequence contains the same number of pixels as the input sequence, but the arrangement of the pixels is different. The object(s) in the input sequence are either removed entirely, moved to a different location, scaled up or down, recolored, or otherwise modified in some way. The overall pattern can be summarized as follows: take an input sequence containing one or more objects, modify it in some way, and produce an output sequence with the same number of pixels but a different arrangement of those pixels.' , 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine how they should be modified. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for groups of adjacent pixels of the same color.\n  * Determine what kind of modification should be made to each object. Some common modifications include moving the object, scaling it up or down, recoloring it, or removing it altogether.\n  * Apply the modifications to the objects in the input sequence to create the output sequence.\n  * Make sure the output sequence has the same number of pixels as the input sequence, and that the arrangement of those pixels is different from the arrangement in the input sequence.\n\nFor example, if the input sequence has two objects, one consisting of three pixels of color 1 and another consisting of seven pixels of color 9, you could move the second object so that it overlaps slightly with the first object, then scale it up to cover the entire width of the image. You could also recolor the objects or remove them entirely, depending on the desired outcome. Be creative and experiment with different modifications until you arrive at the desired output sequence.' , 'transformation': {'input': '[7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'The input sequence consists of one object consisting of seven pixels of color 9, starting at index 7 and ending at index 13.
