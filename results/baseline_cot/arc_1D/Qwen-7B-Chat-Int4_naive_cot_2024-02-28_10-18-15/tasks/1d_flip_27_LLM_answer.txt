prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence contains 16 identical objects of color 8, which are horizontally aligned and cover the entire sequence. The output sequence has the same objects but shifted vertically so that each object starts at index 1 and ends at index 2. In other words, each object is moved up one position.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence contains 16 identical objects of color 1, which are arranged in two rows with four objects per row. The output sequence has the same objects but shifted horizontally so that each object starts at index 4 and ends at index 5. In other words, each object is moved right one position.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence contains 16 identical objects of color 0, which are arranged in four columns with four objects per column. The output sequence has the same objects but shifted horizontally so that each object starts at index 0 and ends at index 1. In other words, each object is moved left one position.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All three examples involve moving objects either horizontally or vertically. In Example 1 and Example 3, the objects are moved up or down while in Example 2, they are moved left or right. Regardless of the direction of movement, the number of objects remains constant (in this case, 16). The objects are also shifted by a fixed amount (one position in Example 1 and Example 3, and two positions in Example 2) so that their final positions differ from their original ones. Finally, the color of the objects does not change during the transformation process.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine the amount of movement required to shift them. You can then apply this movement to each object individually to create the desired output sequence. It may be helpful to draw a diagram or sketch to visualize the transformation process.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Note that the sequence length is 16.', 'object_description': 'In the input sequence, there are 16 identical objects of color 0 arranged in four columns with four objects per column. Each object has dimensions of 4x1.', 'transformed_objects': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, we need to move each object horizontally by one position. This means that the objects will start at indices 0 and end at indices 1. Therefore, the transformed objects will have dimensions of 4x1.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by shifting each object horizontally by one position. The output sequence should have the same length as the input sequence (16), and each object should have dimensions of 4x1. Note that the objects are now shifted to the left by one position compared to their original positions.'}, 'test_output': '[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7]]'}
