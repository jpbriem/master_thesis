prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence consists of 16 identical black pixels. The output sequence also has 16 identical black pixels, but they are arranged differently. Specifically, the four black pixels at index 1 through 4 are shifted to the right one position compared to their positions in the input sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence consists of 16 identical black pixels. The output sequence also has 16 identical black pixels, but they are arranged differently. Specifically, the four black pixels at index 5 through 8 are shifted down one position compared to their positions in the input sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence consists of 16 identical black pixels. The output sequence also has 16 identical black pixels, but they are arranged differently. Specifically, the four black pixels at index 9 through 12 are shifted up one position compared to their positions in the input sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each example, the input sequence consists of 16 identical black pixels. The output sequence also has 16 identical black pixels, but they are arranged differently. Specifically, the number of pixels at each index position is the same in both input and output sequences, but their positions are shifted relative to each other.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, you need to shift each object (i.e., group of 16 consecutive black pixels) according to the specified pattern. In this case, there are three patterns: shifting each object to the left, to the right, or up by one position. You can implement these shifts using Python's built-in functions, such as `shift()` and `slice()`. For example, if the current object starts at index i and ends at index j, then you can shift it to the left by one position using the expression `input[i:j+1] = input[j+1:i]`, where `input` is the input sequence and `j+1` is the new starting index. Similarly, you can shift it to the right or up by one position using similar expressions.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color. For instance, in Example_1, the input sequence contains 16 identical black pixels located at indices 1 through 16. Each object consists of 16 pixels.', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color. For instance, in Example_1, the output sequence should contain 16 identical black pixels located at indices 2 through 17. Each object consists of 16 pixels. To achieve this, you can shift the input objects according to the specified pattern. For example, to shift the object located at index 1 to the left by one position, you can use the expression `input[1:2] = input[2:3]`, which shifts the object to the left by one position.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}
```python
def shift(input_sequence, direction):
    if direction == 'left':
        return input_sequence[:-1]
    elif direction == 'right':
        return input_sequence[1:]
    elif direction == 'up':
        return input_sequence[:-1][::-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError('Invalid direction')

input_sequence = [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output_sequence = shift(input_sequence, 'left')
print(output_sequence)
```

Output:

```
[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
