prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'Objects: There are two objects in this input sequence: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 8, size: 7} Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 9, end_index: 15, size: 6}', 'Example_2': 'Objects: There is one object in this input sequence: Object_1: {color: 6, start_index: 1, end_index: 6, size: 5}', 'Example_3': 'Objects: There is one object in this input sequence: Object_1: {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 11, size: 10}'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In each example, there is an object of the same color in consecutive positions in the input sequence.

This means that you need to move the objects to the left or right until their start index is equal to their end index. You can do this by using the numpy array slicing function to extract the desired portion of the input sequence and then concatenating it with itself to create a new sequence where the objects are shifted.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

import numpy as np

def transform(input):
    # Find the start and end indices of each object
    start_indices = []
    end_indices = []

    for i in range(len(input)):
        if input[i] == 0:
            break
        else:
            start_indices.append(i)
            while input[i] != 0:
                i += 1
                if i >= len(input):
                    raise ValueError('Invalid input')
            end_indices.append(i)

    # Shift the objects to the left or right
    shifted_input = []
    for i in range(len(start_indices) - 1):
        obj = input[start_indices[i]:end_indices[i]]
        if start_indices[i + 1] > end_indices[i]:
            obj = np.concatenate((obj[::-1], obj))
        shifted_input.extend(obj)

    return shifted_input

# Test the function
input = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
output = transform(input)
print(output)
```

Output:

```python
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
