prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, we see that the objects have been recolored from 0 to 3, while their positions remain unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the objects have been moved horizontally, while their positions remain unchanged.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the objects have been scaled down by half, while their positions remain unchanged.'}, 'Overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the objects can be transformed in various ways - recolored, moved, scaled up or down - without changing their position relative to each other.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence, and then apply the appropriate transformation to them. You can use the object description provided in the instructions to help you decide what kind of transformation to apply.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in this input sequence:', 'transformed_objects': 'Transformations applied:', 'output': 'Create the transformed output sequence based on the information provided above.'}, 'test_output': 'np.array([0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])'}}

    objects = []
    for i in range(len(input_sequence)):
        if input_sequence[i] == 0:
            objects.append({'color': 0, 'start_index': i+1, 'end_index': i+1, 'size': 1})
        elif input_sequence[i] == 7:
            objects.append({'color': 7, 'start_index': i+1, 'end_index': i+1, 'size': 1})

    # Apply transformations
    transformed_input_sequence = np.zeros_like(input_sequence)
    for obj in objects:
        if obj['color'] == 0:
            transformed_input_sequence[obj['start_index']:obj['end_index']] = np.arange(obj['start_index'], obj['end_index']) + 3
        elif obj['color'] == 7:
            transformed_input_sequence[obj['start_index']:obj['end_index']] = np.arange(obj['start_index'], obj['end_index']) + 2

    return transformed_input_sequence

# Test case
input_sequence = np.array([0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
print(transform(input_sequence))
```

Output:

```python
