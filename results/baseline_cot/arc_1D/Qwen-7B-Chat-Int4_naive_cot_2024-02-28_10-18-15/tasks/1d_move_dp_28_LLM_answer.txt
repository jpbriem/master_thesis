prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has no noise pixels. The output sequence also has no noise pixels, but it contains an additional object with the same color as the background color (0).', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains one noise pixel at index 15. The output sequence removes this noise pixel. It also adds two new objects, each containing one pixel of the same color as the background color (0), located at indices 14 and 16.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains three noise pixels at indices 2, 5, and 14. The output sequence removes these noise pixels. It also adds two new objects, each containing one pixel of the same color as the background color (0), located at indices 2 and 5.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern in all examples is that the input sequence consists of a set of objects of the same color, where adjacent pixels of the same color are considered to form an object. The output sequence consists of the same set of objects, but possibly with some modifications. In particular, the output sequence may contain additional objects, or may remove existing objects, depending on the specific transformation applied.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to follow the steps below:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence. This involves counting the number of objects and determining their positions and sizes.
  * Determine the desired modification(s) to the input sequence. This may involve adding or removing objects, changing the colors of objects, or modifying the positions or sizes of objects.
  * Apply the desired modification(s) to the input sequence. This may involve using various transformation functions provided in the problem statement.
  * Transform the modified input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.

For example, if the input sequence consists of four objects of color 0, located at indices 0, 2, 4, and 6, and we want to add a new object of color 2 at index 8, then we would apply the following transformation steps:

  * Count the number of objects in the input sequence: there are five objects.
  * Determine the desired modification(s): we want to add a new object of color 2 at index 8.
  * Apply the desired modification(s): we can use the `add_object` function to add a new object at index 8 with color 2.
  * Transform the modified input sequence into its corresponding output sequence: after applying the above transformation steps, the output sequence will consist of six objects of color 0, located at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Note that the specific transformation functions provided in the problem statement may vary from problem to problem, so you will need to consult the problem statement for more information about the available transformation functions.'}, 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the problem statement.', 'object_description': 'In order to determine the objects in the input sequence, you need to count the number of objects and determine their positions and sizes. You can do this by iterating over the input sequence and keeping track of the current object color, starting index, ending index, and size. For example:', 'transformed_objects': 'To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, you need to apply the desired modification(s) to the input sequence. The specific modification(s) will depend on the desired output sequence. For example:', 'output': 'Create the output sequence by applying the desired modification(s) to the input sequence. For example:', }, 'test_output': 'The expected output sequence for the given input sequence is: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]'}
