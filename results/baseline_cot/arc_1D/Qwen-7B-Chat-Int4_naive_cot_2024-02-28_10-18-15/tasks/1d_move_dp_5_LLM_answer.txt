prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two identical objects (represented by the number 2) at positions 1 and 2. In the output sequence, these objects are moved closer together, overlapping each other.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains one object (represented by the number 3) at position 5. This object is removed from the output sequence. Note that this operation does not affect any other objects in the input sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains one object (represented by the number 4) at position 7. This object is scaled down to half its original size and shifted to the left by one position.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All three input-output pairs share the common pattern of transforming an input sequence into an output sequence by applying operations such as moving, removing, scaling, and copying objects. These operations can be performed conditionally or non-conditionally depending on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their unique characteristics, such as color, size, and position.
  * Determine the desired transformation for each object based on the overall pattern shared by the input-output pairs.
  * Apply the chosen transformation operations to the objects in the input sequence to obtain the corresponding output sequence.

For instance, if you want to move an object in the input sequence to a new position, simply select the object and shift it accordingly. If you want to remove an object from the input sequence, identify the object and delete it from the sequence. Similarly, you can apply scaling and copying operations to modify the appearance of objects in the input sequence.
It's important to note that the transformation operations may depend on various factors, including the specific requirements of the problem, the available resources, and the constraints imposed by the system. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully consider the implications of each operation before implementing them in practice.'}, 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]'}
```css
import numpy as np

def transform(input_sequence):
    # Step 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence
    objects = {}
    for i, color in enumerate(input_sequence[1:-1]):
        if color == 2:
            objects[i] = {"size": 2, "start_index": 1, "end_index": 2}
    
    # Step 2: Determine the desired transformation for each object
    transformed_objects = []
    for obj in objects.values():
        if obj["start_index"] != obj["end_index"]:
            obj["size"] += 1
            obj["start_index"] -= 1
    
    # Step 3: Apply the chosen transformation operations to the objects in the input sequence
    transformed_input_sequence = np.zeros_like(input_sequence)
    for i, color in enumerate(input_sequence[1:-1]):
        if color == 2:
            transformed_input_sequence[i] = 2
            transformed_input_sequence[i+1:i+obj["size"]+1] = 2
    
    return transformed_input_sequence

# Test the function
test_case = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
print(transform(test_case))
```

Output:
```python
array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
