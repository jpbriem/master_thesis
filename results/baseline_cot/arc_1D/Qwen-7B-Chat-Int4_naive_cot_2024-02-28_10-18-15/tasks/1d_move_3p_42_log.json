            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe overall pattern of these input-output pairs is that each pixel value (from 1 to 9) corresponds to a specific object. The objects are arranged in rows and columns, with adjacent pixels having the same value indicating an object. Each object has a unique color represented by a number from 1 to 9. Additionally, there may be some noise pixels (represented by 0) that do not belong to any object.\nTo transform the given input sequence into its output sequence, we need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and then apply the appropriate transformation operations to them. We can count the number of objects, their sizes, positions, and colors. Based on this information, we can decide which transformation operations to apply to each object. For example, if two objects are overlapping, we can choose to either merge them or remove one of them. Similarly, if an object is too small, we can choose to resize it or delete it altogether.\nHere's an example of how we could transform the given input sequence into its output sequence:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence: In this case, we see that there are four objects of color 2 arranged in a square shape.\n  * Apply the appropriate transformation operations to each object: Since the objects are arranged in a square shape, we can simply copy them from the input sequence to the output sequence without making any changes. However, if the objects were not arranged in a square shape, we would need to perform additional operations to ensure they maintain their original shape and size.\n  * Create the resulting output sequence: In this case, the output sequence would be [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n  * Return the created output sequence: [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nNote that the above steps are just an example, and the actual transformation process may vary depending on the specific input sequence and desired output sequence."
