            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe overall pattern in these examples is that each object is represented by a contiguous block of pixels with the same value, and the size of this block corresponds to the number of consecutive pixels with the same value. The output sequence is obtained by replacing each object with its corresponding number of pixels.\nFor Example_1:\n\n  * Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Explanation: The object at index 5 has a size of 4 and is represented by the block of pixels with value 4 from index 4 to index 7. This object is replaced with its corresponding number of pixels (4) in the output sequence.\n\nFor Example_2:\n\n  * Input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0]\n  * Explanation: The object at index 6 has a size of 4 and is represented by the block of pixels with value 4 from index 5 to index 8. This object is replaced with its corresponding number of pixels (4) in the output sequence.\n\nFor Example_3:\n\n  * Input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Explanation: The object at index 3 has a size of 3 and is represented by the block of pixels with value 3 from index 2 to index 4. This object is replaced with its corresponding number of pixels (3) in the output sequence.\n\nTo transform the given input into its corresponding output, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and replace them with their corresponding numbers of pixels. We can do this using the following steps:\n\n  1. Initialize an empty list called `objects` to store the identified objects.\n  2. Iterate over the input sequence and check if there are any adjacent pixels with the same value. If so, increment a counter variable called `count`.\n  3. If the counter reaches the size of the object, add a new dictionary to the `objects` list with keys `color`, `start_index`, `end_index`, and `size`. Set the `color` key to the current value of the counter and set the other keys to appropriate values.\n  4. After iterating over the entire input sequence, iterate over the `objects` list and replace each object with its corresponding number of pixels. To do this, initialize another empty list called `result` and append the number of pixels for each object to it. Finally, return the `result` list.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    objects = []\n    count = 0\n\n    # Identify objects\n    for i in range(1, len(input_sequence)):\n        if input_sequence[i] == input_sequence[i - 1]:\n            count += 1\n            if count == 4:\n                objects.append({'color': count, 'start_index': i - 3, 'end_index': i - 2, 'size': 4})\n\n    # Replace objects with corresponding numbers of pixels\n    result = []\n    for obj in objects:\n        result.extend([obj['color']] * obj['size'])\n\n    return result\n```\n\nUsing this function, we can transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:\n\n```makefile\ninput_sequence = [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_sequence = transform(input_sequence)\nprint(output_sequence)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nTherefore, the output sequence is obtained by replacing each object with its corresponding number of pixels."
