prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The transformation pattern for these input-output pairs can be described as follows:

  * Each object in the input sequence has a unique color represented by an integer value from 1 to 9.
  * An object's size is determined by the number of adjacent pixels of the same color it contains. In other words, if two pixels are both of the same color, they form part of one object. If three or more pixels are of the same color, they form multiple objects, each having a size equal to the number of pixels involved.
  * The order of the pixels in the input sequence does not matter, but the objects must appear in the same order in the output sequence.
  * When transforming an object, its color may change depending on the transformation action applied to it. However, the size of the object will remain the same regardless of any changes made to its color.
  * Some transformations may involve removing, moving, scaling, copying, or recoloring objects, while others may involve adding noise pixels or applying conditions to determine which objects should be transformed and how.

To transform the given test input sequence into its test output sequence, we can follow the following steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by counting the number of adjacent pixels of the same color. Store the information about each object in a dictionary, including its color, start index, end index, and size.
  2. Sort the objects by their starting index.
  3. Iterate over the sorted objects, starting from the first one.
  4. For each object, apply the appropriate transformation based on the type of transformation specified in the instructions. For example, if the transformation involves removing objects, iterate over the object's range and remove any pixels that do not belong to the object.
  5. Update the size of the remaining objects by subtracting the removed pixels from their current size.
  6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until no more objects need to be processed.
  7. Create the final output sequence by concatenating the remaining pixels together, making sure to include the background color (0) at the beginning and end of the sequence.

Using this approach, we can transform the given test input sequence into its corresponding test output sequence, which would be:

```css
[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
```

Note that the output sequence includes the background color (0) at the beginning and end of the sequence, as required by the instructions. Also note that the size of some objects may have changed due to the application of certain transformations.
