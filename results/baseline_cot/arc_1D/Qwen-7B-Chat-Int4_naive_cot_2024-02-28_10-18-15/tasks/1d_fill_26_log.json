            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern:\nAll three examples follow the same transformation pattern where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. Each object can be transformed through various actions such as moving, scaling, removing, etc. \n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform a new input into its output, we need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation action on them. We also need to consider the conditions and arithmetics mentioned in the description. Here's an example of transforming a new input into its output:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nTransformation:\nThe input sequence contains one object with color 1 at index 15 (counting starts from 0). To transform this object, we can perform any combination of the available transformation actions. For example, we could move it to the right by two positions (index 17) while keeping its original size and color. Alternatively, we could scale it down by half its current size (while preserving its color).\n\nHere's the code snippet to transform the input sequence into its output:\n\n```python\n# Define the transformation function\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    # Identify the objects present in the input sequence\n    objects = []\n    for i in range(len(input_sequence)):\n        if input_sequence[i:i+4].sum() == 4:\n            objects.append({\"color\": input_sequence[i], \"start_index\": i, \"end_index\": i + 3, \"size\": 4})\n    \n    # Transform each object according to the desired actions\n    transformed_objects = []\n    for obj in objects:\n        # Move the object to the right by two positions\n        transformed_objects.append({\"color\": obj[\"color\"], \"start_index\": obj[\"start_index\"] + 2, \"end_index\": obj[\"end_index\"] + 2, \"size\": obj[\"size\"]})\n        \n        # Scale the object down by half its current size\n        # transformed_objects.append({\"color\": obj[\"color\"], \"start_index\": obj[\"start_index\"], \"end_index\": obj[\"end_index\"], \"size\": int(obj[\"size\"]/2)})\n    \n    # Create the output sequence by concatenating the transformed objects\n    output_sequence = np.zeros((len(input_sequence), len(input_sequence[0])))\n    for i in range(len(transformed_objects)):\n        start_index = transformed_objects[i][\"start_index\"]\n        end_index = transformed_objects[i][\"end_index\"]\n        size = transformed_objects[i][\"size\"]\n        output_sequence[start_index:end_index, start_index:end_index] += transformed_objects[i][\"color\"]\n    \n    return output_sequence\n\n# Test the transformation function\ninput_sequence = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]])\nprint(\"Original input:\", input_sequence)\noutput_sequence = transform(input_sequence)\nprint(\"Transformed output:\", output_sequence)\n```\n\nNote that the above code snippet assumes that the input sequence has been converted to a NumPy array using `np.array`. If you haven't done so already, you may want to add that line before running the code."
