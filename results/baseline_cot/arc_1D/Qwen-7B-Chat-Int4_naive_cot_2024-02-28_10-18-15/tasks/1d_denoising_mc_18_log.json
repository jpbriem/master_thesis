            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe given input-output pairs share the same underlying transformation pattern where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. The transformation involves moving, removing, and copying these objects. Let's apply this pattern to the given test case.\n\nDescription:\n\nExample_1: In the input sequence, there are no objects present. However, after applying the transformation, two objects appear - one containing 2 white pixels and another containing 1 black pixel.\n\nExample_2: In the input sequence, there are three objects present. After applying the transformation, all three objects remain unchanged.\n\nExample_3: In the input sequence, there are six objects present. After applying the transformation, four objects remain unchanged while two others are removed due to being outside the boundary of the image.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform the test case input sequence into its test output sequence, we need to identify and manipulate the objects present in the input sequence. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for adjacent pixels of the same color. If multiple objects are found at the same location, merge them into a single object.\n\nStep 2: Move each identified object to its desired location in the output sequence. To do this, calculate the relative coordinates of the object in the input sequence and adjust it accordingly in the output sequence.\n\nStep 3: Remove any objects that fall outside the boundary of the image.\n\nStep 4: Copy any objects that are required in more than one location in the output sequence.\n\nTransformed Objects:\n\nIn the transformed output sequence, there will be five objects present - one containing 4 white pixels and four containing 4 black pixels.\n\nOutput:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
