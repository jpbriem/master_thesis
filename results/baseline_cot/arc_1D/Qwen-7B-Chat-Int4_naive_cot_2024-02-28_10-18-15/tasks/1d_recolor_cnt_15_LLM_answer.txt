prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The transformation pattern observed in these examples can be described as follows:

  * The input sequence consists of a series of pixels, where each pixel has a value between 1 and 9 (inclusive) representing a specific color.
  * There are multiple objects present in the input sequence, represented by consecutive blocks of the same color.
  * Each object has a unique start index and end index indicating the range of pixels belonging to that object.
  * Some objects may overlap or contain other objects.
  * The output sequence is obtained by applying certain transformation operations on the input sequence.

To create the test output sequence, we need to perform the following steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using their start and end indices.
  2. Determine the properties of each object, such as its size, position, and color.
  3. Apply the appropriate transformation operation(s) to each object to obtain its final location and appearance in the output sequence.
  4. Combine the transformed objects together to form the final output sequence.

Based on this pattern, we can transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence as follows:

  * Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Output: [0, 0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0, 0, 8, 5, 9, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Note that the output sequence has been modified by applying various transformation operations to the input sequence. Specifically, we have replaced some objects with new ones that have different sizes and positions, and we have also recolored some objects to change their appearance. We have also removed some noise pixels from the output sequence to improve its clarity.
