prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The transformation pattern observed in these examples involves copying and modifying specific regions of the input sequence to create the output sequence. Specifically, each object in the input sequence (represented by a range of consecutive pixels) is copied and then modified to change its color value.
For example, in Example_1, the range [0, 6] is copied and then the color value at index 4 is replaced with 9, resulting in an output sequence where object 1 has been moved one pixel to the right and object 2 has been removed entirely.
In Example_2, the range [0, 7] is copied and then the color value at index 3 is replaced with 2, resulting in an output sequence where object 1 has been scaled down by half.
In Example_3, the range [0, 8] is copied and then the color value at index 2 is replaced with 1, resulting in an output sequence where object 2 has been recolored to red.
Overall Pattern: In this transformation pattern, objects are identified by their starting and ending indices in the input sequence. Each object is then copied and modified according to some rule or condition, such as moving it to a new location, scaling it up or down, changing its color, or removing it altogether.
Instructions: To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence using their starting and ending indices. Once you have identified the objects, you can apply the appropriate transformation rule or condition to modify them accordingly. You may need to use additional tools or techniques, such as arithmetic operations or logical conditions, to perform these modifications.
Transformation:

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_sequence):
    # Identify the objects in the input sequence
    objects = []
    for i in range(1, len(input_sequence)):
        if input_sequence[i] == input_sequence[i - 1]:
            continue
        else:
            objects.append({
                'start_index': i,
                'end_index': i + 1,
                'size': 1,
                'color': input_sequence[i],
            })

    # Transform each object according to some rule or condition
    output_sequence = np.copy(input_sequence)
    for obj in objects:
        # Move object to a new location
        if obj['color'] > 0:
            output_sequence[obj['start_index']:obj['end_index']] += 1

        # Scale object up or down
        elif obj['color'] < 0:
            output_sequence[obj['start_index']:obj['end_index']] *= -1

        # Change object's color
        else:
            output_sequence[obj['start_index']:obj['end_index']] = 0

    return output_sequence
```

Test Output:
```scss
[0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]
```
