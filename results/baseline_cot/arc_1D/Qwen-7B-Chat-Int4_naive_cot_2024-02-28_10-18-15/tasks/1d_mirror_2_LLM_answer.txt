prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has four identical blocks of 4s followed by one block of zeros. The output sequence has only zeros where there were zeros in the input sequence, but it also has an extra block of zeros at the beginning. This indicates that the transformation adds an extra block of zeros at the beginning.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has two identical blocks of 5s followed by one block of zeros. The output sequence has only zeros where there were zeros in the input sequence, but it also has one more block of zeros than the input sequence. This indicates that the transformation removes one block of zeros from the input sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has one block of five consecutive 5s followed by one block of zeros. The output sequence has only zeros where there were zeros in the input sequence, but it also has one less block of zeros than the input sequence. This indicates that the transformation removes one block of zeros from the input sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All three input-output pairs follow the same transformation pattern: adding or removing a block of zeros at the beginning or the end of the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, you need to add or remove a block of zeros at the beginning or the end of the input sequence. You can do this by copying the last block of zeros from the input sequence if the input sequence ends with zeros, or by copying the first block of zeros from the input sequence if the input sequence starts with zeros. After adding or removing the block of zeros, you can then proceed to count the number of objects in the input sequence, sort them in ascending order, and apply any other necessary transformations (such as moving, hollowing, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring) to the remaining objects. Finally, you can create the output sequence by repeating the process until you reach the desired length.', 'transformation': {'input': '[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, the object is a single block of five consecutive 5s followed by one block of zeros. The size of the object is five units long and one unit wide, starting at index 1 and ending at index 6. Its position is centered horizontally and vertically within the input sequence.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the object will still be a single block of five consecutive 5s, but now it will be located at the very beginning of the input sequence. It will have the same size and position as before, but its color will be unchanged because no recoloring operation was applied. Therefore, the transformed object will look exactly the same as the original object.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': 'return np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])'}
