prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The transformation pattern in these examples involves creating copies of the object at a specific location and changing its color. In Example 1, the object is copied at index 4 and its color is changed from 0 to 7. In Example 2, the object is copied at index 5 and its color is changed from 0 to 9. In Example 3, the object is copied at index 6 and its color is changed from 0 to 1.
To transform the given input sequence into its output sequence, we can follow the following steps:

  1. Identify the object(s) present in the input sequence.
  2. Create a copy of each identified object at the desired location.
  3. Change the color of the copied object to the specified value.

For the given input sequence [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], there are two objects present: one at index 1 with color 3 and another at index 7 with color 3. We can create a copy of both objects at index 4 and change their color to 0 as follows:

```
[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```


We can write the overall pattern as follows:

```
Input: [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]
Output: [y_1, y_2, ..., y_m]

where m = n + k, and y_i = (c_1, c_2, ..., c_k), where c_j is the color of object j in the input sequence, and i ranges from 1 to m, and j ranges from 1 to k.
```

In this pattern, `n` is the number of objects in the input sequence, `k` is the number of copies of each object, and `m` is the total number of objects in the output sequence.

Instructions for transforming a new input into its output would involve identifying the objects present in the input sequence, creating copies of them at the desired locations, and changing their color to the specified value. This process needs to be repeated for each object in the input sequence.

Transformation of the test case input sequence into its output sequence would involve the following steps:

  1. Identify the object(s) present in the input sequence.
  2. Create a copy of each identified object at index 4.
  3. Change the color of the copied object to 0.

Therefore, the transformed output sequence would be:

```
[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```


And the final answer in JSON format would be:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
        "Example_2": "Regarding the second example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!",
        "Example_3": "Regarding the third example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!"
    },
    "overall_pattern": "There are three objects in the input sequence: one at index 1 with color 3 and another at index 7 with color 3. In the output sequence, there are four objects: two copies of the object at index 1 with color 0 and two copies of the object at index 7 with color 0.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence, create copies of them at the desired locations, and change their color to the specified value. You also need to repeat this process for each object in the input sequence.",
    "transformation": {

        "object_description": "The input sequence has two objects: one at index 1 with color 3 and another at index 7 with color 3.",
        "transformed_objects": "The transformed output sequence has four objects: two copies of the object at index 1 with color 0 and two copies of the object at index 7 with color 0."
    },
    "test_output": "[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}
