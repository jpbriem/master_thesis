            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription of Example_1: In this example, the input sequence has two objects, one of them is of size 2 (from index 1 to 2) and the other is of size 8 (from index 5 to 12). Both objects are located at the beginning of the sequence. After applying the transformation, the second object becomes larger (size increased from 8 to 12), it is now located at index 6 instead of 5, and it covers the previous object of size 2 (now considered as noise).\nDescription of Example_2: This example also has two objects, one of size 3 (from index 1 to 3) and the other of size 1 (from index 4 to 4). Both objects are located at the beginning of the sequence. After applying the transformation, the second object remains the same but its location changes from index 4 to 3, and it covers the previous object of size 3 (now considered as noise).\nDescription of Example_3: This example has three objects, one of size 4 (from index 1 to 4), another of size 0 (from index 5 to 5) and the third of size 2 (from index 6 to 8). All objects are located at the beginning of the sequence. After applying the transformation, the last object becomes larger (size increased from 2 to 4), it is now located at index 6 instead of 5, and it covers the previous object of size 0 (now considered as noise).\n\nOverall Pattern: The overall pattern is that the objects in the input sequence can change their size, location and color after being transformed. Additionally, there might be some noise pixels present in the input sequence which will disappear after being transformed.\nInstructions: To transform a new input into its output, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence, then we can apply the appropriate transformation action to each object depending on what needs to be done. For example, if an object needs to become larger, we can increase its size, if it needs to be moved, we can shift its location, etc. We also need to take care of any noise pixels present in the input sequence, making sure they do not affect the final result.\nTransformation: The input sequence is: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. There are no objects present in this sequence, so nothing needs to be transformed.\nTest Output: Since there are no objects in the input sequence, the output sequence will also be empty: []"
