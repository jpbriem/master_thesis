            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe underlying transformation pattern in these examples is:\n\n- Start at the first object (the one with the largest number).\n- If there are multiple objects of the same color, choose the object with the smallest index.\n- Move each object by its size to the right until it reaches the last object.\n- If an object reaches the end of the sequence without being moved, leave it where it is.\n- If an object overlaps with another object, merge them together by setting their colors to the average of their original colors.\n- If an object does not overlap with any other object, replace it with a single color that corresponds to the average of its original colors.\n\nTo transform the given input into its corresponding output, we can follow this pattern step-by-step:\n\n- Start at the first object (the one with the largest number), which has a color of 7 and a size of 5.\n- Move it to the right by its size until it reaches the last object, which has a color of 0 and a size of 4.\n- Since the object reaches the end of the sequence without being moved, leave it where it is.\n- There are no overlapping objects, so nothing needs to be merged.\n- Replace the object with a single color that corresponds to the average of its original colors, which would be (7+0)/2=3.5.\n- This gives us the final output sequence: [7, 7, 7, 7, 3.5, 0, 0, 0, 2].\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence is [7, 7, 7, 7, 3.5, 0, 0, 0, 2]."
