prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, we see an object with the color 0 at index 0. It has a size of 8 units. There is another object with the color 9 at index 1. It also has a size of 8 units.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, we see two objects. The first one has the color 0 at index 0. Its size is 8 units. The second one has the color 6 at index 5. Its size is 8 units.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In both examples, there is a single object per pixel. Each object can have any color from 1 to 9, including the background color (0). The objects can overlap but cannot contain each other. The size of an object is determined by its bounding box, which is defined by the indices of the first and last non-zero pixel of the object.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to count the number of objects present in the input sequence and create a new output sequence where each object appears once. If multiple objects overlap, they will be merged into a single object. If an object contains another object, it will be removed from the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided above:', 'object_description': 'Count the number of objects in the input sequence:', 'transformed_objects': 'Create a new output sequence where each object appears once:', 'output': 'Output the transformed sequence above in numpy array format:'}, 'test_output': '[[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]'}}
```scss
import numpy as np

def count_objects(input_sequence):
    num_objects = 0
    for i in range(len(input_sequence)):
        if input_sequence[i] != 0:
            num_objects += 1
    return num_objects

def transform_input(input_sequence):
    num_objects = count_objects(input_sequence)
    output_sequence = np.zeros((len(input_sequence), len(input_sequence)), dtype=np.int32)
    for i in range(num_objects):
        start_index = i * 8
        end_index = start_index + 8
        output_sequence[start_index:end_index] = input_sequence[start_index:end_index]
    return output_sequence

input_sequence = np.array([0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
output_sequence = transform_input(input_sequence)

print(output_sequence)
```

Note: This solution assumes that the input sequence is a numpy array of integers with values from 1 to 9 and 0 representing the background color.
