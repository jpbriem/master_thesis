            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: In this transformation pattern, an object is moved to a new location while preserving its original size. If there is no space available for the object at its current location, it will be copied to a neighboring location with enough space. Additionally, if there is an empty space next to the object, it may be filled with another object or left empty.\nInstructions: To transform the input into its output, you can follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify any objects in the input sequence. An object is defined as a continuous sequence of pixels of the same color.\n  2. Move each object to a new location while preserving its original size. This means that you cannot shrink or expand the object during the movement process.\n  3. Check if there is an empty space next to each object. If so, fill the space with another object or leave it empty.\n  4. Copy any remaining objects to their new locations.\n\nFor the given test case, the input sequence contains two objects: one consisting of four consecutive pixels of color 8, and another consisting of three consecutive pixels of color 0. The output sequence should contain the same objects but in a different arrangement. Here's how the transformation can be performed:\n\n  1. The object consisting of four consecutive pixels of color 8 is located at index 0 to 3. We can move it to index 5 to 8 while preserving its size.\n  2. The object consisting of three consecutive pixels of color 0 is located at index 7 to 9. We can copy it to index 4 to 6, leaving an empty space next to it.\n  3. There are no more objects to move or copy, so we are done.\n\nTherefore, the transformed output sequence should be:\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]."
