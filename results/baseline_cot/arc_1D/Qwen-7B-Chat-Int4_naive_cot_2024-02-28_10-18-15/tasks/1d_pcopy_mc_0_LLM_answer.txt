prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, there is an object with the color 2 that starts at index 1 and ends at index 2 with a size of 2. There is also an object with the color 3 that starts at index 4 and ends at index 4 with a size of 1.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, there is an object with the color 2 that starts at index 1 and ends at index 2 with a size of 2. There is also an object with the color 7 that starts at index 7 and ends at index 7 with a size of 1.', 'Overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern of these examples involves transforming an input sequence into an output sequence where adjacent pixels of the same color are considered as objects. The objects can be moved, scaled, removed, copied, recolored, etc., and their relations with each other can change depending on the transformation applied.'}, 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, and color. Then, apply the appropriate transformation action(s) to the objects, taking into account their relations with each other. Finally, create the resulting output sequence, paying attention to the sequence length.'}, 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 5 starting at index 1 and ending at index 5 with a size of 5; Object_2 with color 7 starting at index 6 and ending at index 6 with a size of 1.', 'transformed_objects': 'To obtain the transformed objects, we can perform several operations on the objects. For example, we could move Object_1 to index 4, making it overlap with Object_2. We could also scale Object_1 up to a size of 10 and move it to index 8, while scaling Object_2 down to a size of 1 and moving it to index 10. Alternatively, we could remove Object_1 altogether and replace it with a new object of color 3 with a size of 5, starting at index 1 and ending at index 5. To summarize, the transformed objects would be: Object_1 (moved to index 4), Object_2 (scaled up to a size of 10 and moved to index 8), Object_3 (new object with color 3 and size 5 starting at index 1 and ending at index 5).', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])'}`
