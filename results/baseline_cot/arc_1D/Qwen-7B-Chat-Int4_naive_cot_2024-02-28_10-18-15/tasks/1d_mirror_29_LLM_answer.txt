prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": { "Example_1": "In Example 1, the input sequence contains 16 elements. Each element represents a pixel value from 0 to 9. There are two objects: one containing 5 pixels with value 1 (objects[0]), another containing 5 pixels with value 9 (objects[1]).", "Example_2": "In Example 2, the input sequence also contains 16 elements. However, there is only one object in this example, which contains 8 pixels with value 7.", "Example_3": "In Example 3, the input sequence has 17 elements. There are two objects: one containing 5 pixels with value 1 (objects[0]), another containing 2 pixels with value 9 (objects[1])." }, "overall_pattern": "All three input-output pairs follow the same pattern. In each pair, the input sequence contains 16 or 17 elements, with at least one object. The number of objects in each pair varies depending on the specific example. In each pair, the objects are arranged in a grid-like structure, with adjacent pixels having the same value. The output sequence contains the same number of elements as the input sequence, but the pixels have been transformed according to the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the pixels belonging to an object are replaced by their corresponding values, while the pixels outside the objects remain unchanged. The transformation process involves copying the objects from the input sequence to the output sequence, scaling them if necessary, and adjusting their positions." , "instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and perform the appropriate transformation operations on them. First, count the number of objects in the input sequence and determine their sizes and positions. Next, apply the appropriate transformation operations to each object, including copying it to the output sequence, scaling it if necessary, and adjusting its position. Finally, adjust the remaining pixels in the output sequence so that they match the desired pattern. Note that the exact transformation operations will depend on the specific patterns of the input and output sequences." , "transformation": {"input": "[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]", "object_description": "There are no objects in this input sequence. It consists of 16 pixels, all of which have value 4 except for the last two pixels, which have value 0.", "transformed_objects": "Copy the objects from the input sequence to the output sequence. Since there are no objects in this example, simply copy the entire input sequence to the output sequence.", "output": "[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]" } , "test_output": "[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]" }
```scss
# Test Case

input = [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output = [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Note that the `test_output` field above shows the expected result after applying the transformation steps outlined in the instructions.
