prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description of Example_1: In this example, there are two objects: Object_1 (color: 2) and Object_2 (color: 3). Object_1 starts at index 1 and ends at index 2, covering 2 pixels. Object_2 starts at index 4 and ends at index 4, covering 1 pixel. After applying the transformation, the output sequence has one object: Object_3 (color: 7), which covers 7 pixels starting at index 1 and ending at index 8.
Overall Pattern: This pattern involves transforming an input sequence into an output sequence where each pixel can belong to multiple objects. Each object may have a specific color, position, and size, and their relationships with other objects can determine the overall appearance of the output sequence. Additionally, noise pixels may also exist in both the input and output sequences.
Instructions: To transform the given input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and create corresponding objects in the output sequence. You can do this by counting the number of occurrences of each color in the input sequence and creating a new object for each unique color. Then, you need to check if any of the existing objects in the output sequence cover the same area as the newly created objects. If so, merge them together. Finally, adjust the positions of the remaining objects to ensure they are properly aligned and don't overlap.
Transformation: Input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0] Output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
Test Output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
