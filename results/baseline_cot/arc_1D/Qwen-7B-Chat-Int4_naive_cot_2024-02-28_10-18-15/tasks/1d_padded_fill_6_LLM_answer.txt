prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern: All three input-output pairs follow the same transformation pattern where each object is transformed based on its position and size. The transformation can involve moving, scaling, recoloring, or removing an object. Additionally, the noise pixels in the input sequence do not affect the output sequence.
Instructions: To transform a new input into its output, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions and sizes. We then apply the appropriate transformation rule to each object based on its position and size. Finally, we remove any noise pixels and return the resulting output sequence.
Transformation: 

Input: Copy the provided test case input sequence.
Object Description: Regard the input sequence as a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 9. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their values. Each object consists of a set of pixels with the same value. The size of an object is determined by the number of pixels it occupies. The position of an object is determined by its starting index in the input sequence.
Transformed Objects: Based on the identified objects, create the corresponding transformed objects. The transformation involves applying the appropriate transformation rule to each object based on its position and size. For example, if an object consists of 5 pixels with value 5, the transformed object would consist of 5 pixels with value 5 at the same position as the original object. If an object consists of 7 pixels with value 0, the transformed object would consist of 7 pixels with value 0 at the same position as the original object.
Output: Remove any noise pixels from the input sequence and return the resulting output sequence.
Test Output:

```python
import numpy as np

# Test Case Input Sequence
input_sequence = np.array([0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0])

# Expected Output Sequence
expected_output = np.array([0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

# Check if the expected output sequence matches the actual output sequence
np.testing.assert_array_equal(expected_output, input_sequence)
```

Note: This solution assumes that the input sequence contains no duplicate objects. If there are duplicate objects in the input sequence, this solution will only handle one instance of each object.
