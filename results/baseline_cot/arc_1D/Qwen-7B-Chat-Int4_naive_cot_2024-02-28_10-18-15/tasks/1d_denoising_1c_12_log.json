            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: The input sequence has 18 objects, each object being represented by a 1D binary array where 1 indicates presence of an object and 0 indicates absence. The objects are arranged in two rows and three columns. Each row contains four objects and each column contains three objects. The output sequence has 17 objects, each object being represented by a 1D binary array where 1 indicates presence of an object and 0 indicates absence. The objects are arranged in two rows and three columns. Each row contains four objects and each column contains three objects. The objects in the output sequence are identical to those in the input sequence except for one object at index (row, col) = (2, 2), which has been removed.\n  * Example_2: The input sequence has 10 objects, each object being represented by a 1D binary array where 1 indicates presence of an object and 0 indicates absence. The objects are arranged in five rows and five columns. Each row contains two objects and each column contains two objects. The output sequence has 9 objects, each object being represented by a 1D binary array where 1 indicates presence of an object and 0 indicates absence. The objects are arranged in five rows and five columns. Each row contains two objects and each column contains two objects. One object at index (row, col) = (4, 4) has been removed.\n  * Example_3: The input sequence has 12 objects, each object being represented by a 1D binary array where 1 indicates presence of an object and 0 indicates absence. The objects are arranged in six rows and six columns. Each row contains three objects and each column contains two objects. The output sequence has 11 objects, each object being represented by a 1D binary array where 1 indicates presence of an object and 0 indicates absence. The objects are arranged in six rows and six columns. Each row contains three objects and each column contains two objects. One object at index (row, col) = (5, 4) has been removed.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * In all examples, the input sequence consists of multiple objects arranged in a grid. Each object is represented by a binary array where 1 indicates presence of an object and 0 indicates absence.\n  * The output sequence also consists of multiple objects arranged in a grid. However, some objects may be missing compared to their counterparts in the input sequence. These missing objects can be identified using a condition that checks if the current object's location is occupied by another object in either the input or output sequence.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking at the binary arrays where 1 indicates presence of an object and 0 indicates absence.\n  * Remove any objects from the input sequence that are located at positions where there is already an object present in either the input or output sequence.\n  * Create the corresponding output sequence by applying the same conditions to identify and remove any objects that are located at positions where there is already an object present in either the input or output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output:\n\n  * [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]"
