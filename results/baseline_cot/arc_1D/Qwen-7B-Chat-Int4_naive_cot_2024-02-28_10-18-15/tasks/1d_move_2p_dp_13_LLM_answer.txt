prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern: In this transformation pattern, there is an object called "Background" represented by the value 0. This Background object can occupy any number of positions in the input sequence. Additionally, there may be other objects called "Objects" represented by the values from 1 to 9. These Objects may also occupy any number of positions in the input sequence, but their total size must be less than or equal to the size of the Background object. If an Object overlaps with another Object or the Background, it will be treated as if it were fully contained within the larger object. Finally, there may be noise pixels represented by the value 0.
Instructions: To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and perform the necessary operations on them to obtain the output sequence. Here's a step-by-step guide:

  1. Identify the Background object in the input sequence. It is represented by the value 0 and has no specific position requirements.
  2. Identify the Object(s) in the input sequence. They are represented by the values from 1 to 9 and may occupy any number of positions in the input sequence. However, they must be smaller than or equal to the size of the Background object.
  3. Sort the Objects in increasing order of他们的颜色（即从1到9）。
  4. Create an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
  5. Iterate over each Object in the sorted list and perform the following operations:
    * If the Object does not overlap with any existing Object or the Background, simply add it to the output sequence at its original position in the input sequence.
    * Otherwise, calculate the total size of the overlapping Object and subtract it from the size of the Background object. Add the remaining part of the Background object (if any) to the output sequence.
  6. If there are any leftover pixels in the Input sequence after removing all Objects, treat these as noise pixels and add them to the output sequence.
  7. Return the final output sequence.

Transformation: Here's how the transformation would work for the given Test Case:

  1. The Background object is represented by the value 0 and occupies the entire input sequence.
  2. There are two Objects present in the input sequence: Object_1 with color 4 and Object_2 with color 9. Both Objects overlap with the Background, so we need to calculate the size of the Background object and subtract the total size of the Objects from it. After doing this, we find that the remaining part of the Background object is 4 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall. We add this part of the Background object to the output sequence, leaving us with a single Object_1 with color 4 and size 8.
  3. There are no noise pixels in the input sequence.

Output: The resulting output sequence would be [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0].
