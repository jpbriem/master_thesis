prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence consists of a large number of identical black pixels surrounded by a few white pixels. The output sequence also consists of a large number of identical black pixels surrounded by a few white pixels. However, the black pixels are arranged differently in the two sequences. In the input sequence, they form a grid-like structure with each row consisting of four black pixels and three white pixels. In the output sequence, the rows are rearranged so that there are five black pixels and two white pixels per row.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence consists of a small number of identical black pixels surrounded by a single white pixel. The output sequence also consists of a small number of identical black pixels surrounded by a single white pixel. However, the black pixels are arranged differently in the two sequences. In the input sequence, they form a straight line with each pixel separated by one pixel from the next. In the output sequence, the pixels are arranged in a zigzag pattern with each pixel separated by two pixels from the next.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence consists of a small number of identical black pixels surrounded by a single white pixel. The output sequence also consists of a small number of identical black pixels surrounded by a single white pixel. However, the black pixels are arranged differently in the two sequences. In the input sequence, they form a square shape with each pixel separated by one pixel from the next. In the output sequence, the pixels are arranged in an irregular pattern with no clear pattern or arrangement.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern observed in these examples is that the input sequence contains a large number of identical black pixels surrounded by a smaller number of white pixels. The output sequence also contains a large number of identical black pixels surrounded by a smaller number of white pixels. However, the arrangement of the black and white pixels differs between the input and output sequences. In some cases, the black pixels form a regular grid-like structure, while in other cases they form a more irregular pattern. The number of black and white pixels in each row or column may also differ between the input and output sequences. Additionally, the orientation of the input and output sequences may be different, with the input sequence being horizontal or vertical and the output sequence being rotated or flipped.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to perform the following steps:

  * Identify the patterns in the input and output sequences, including the number of black and white pixels, their arrangement, and any other relevant features.
  * Determine how the patterns in the input and output sequences differ, including any changes in the number or arrangement of black and white pixels.
  * Based on this analysis, determine the necessary transformation operations to convert the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.
  * Implement the identified transformation operations to create the output sequence.
  * Verify that the output sequence matches the corresponding pattern in the input sequence.

For example, in Example_1, you would identify that the input sequence consists of a grid-like structure with four black pixels and three white pixels in each row. You would then determine that the output sequence also consists of a grid-like structure with five black pixels and two white pixels in each row. To transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you could implement a rotation operation to flip the input sequence horizontally and then apply a scaling operation to increase the number of black and white pixels in each row.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task description and paste it below. Pay attention to the number and arrangement of black and white pixels.', 'object_description': 'Identify the patterns in the input and output sequences, including the number of black and white pixels, their arrangement, and any other relevant features. Focus on the differences between the input and output sequences, including any changes in the number or arrangement of black and white pixels.', 'transformed_objects': 'Based on the analysis of the input and output sequences, determine the necessary transformation operations to convert the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence. This may involve changing the number or arrangement of black and white pixels, applying rotations or translations, or performing other operations as needed. Once you have determined the necessary transformation operations, implement them to create the transformed objects.', 'output': 'Create the transformed object(s) using the appropriate transformation operations. Make sure that the output sequence matches the corresponding pattern in the input sequence. Paste the transformed object(s) below.}'}, 'test_output': 'I am sorry, but I cannot provide a test output without knowing the specific input sequence you want me to transform. Please provide the input sequence below and I will do my best to help you.'}
