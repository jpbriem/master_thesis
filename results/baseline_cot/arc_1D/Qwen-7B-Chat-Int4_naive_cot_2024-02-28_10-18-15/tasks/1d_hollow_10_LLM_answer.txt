prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input has 80 black pixels and one white pixel. The output also has 80 black pixels but the white pixel is now at index 5.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input has 80 black pixels and one white pixel. The output has 79 black pixels and one white pixel, where the white pixel is now at index 1.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input has 80 black pixels and 80 blue pixels. The output has 80 black pixels and 80 red pixels.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All three examples follow the same pattern of transforming an input sequence into an output sequence where the number of objects remains the same but their positions change. Additionally, the color of some objects changes.', ' instructions': 'To transform the input into the output, we need to find the position of each object in both input and output sequences, then adjust the position of each object in the output sequence so it aligns with the corresponding object in the input sequence. If the color of an object in the input sequence is different than the corresponding object in the output sequence, we can simply assign the color of the object in the input sequence to the corresponding object in the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence into a numpy array:', 'object_description': 'For each object in the input sequence, determine its start index and end index, as well as its size (number of consecutive pixels).', 'transformed_objects': 'Shift each object in the input sequence to the corresponding position in the output sequence. Also, if necessary, adjust the size of the object in the output sequence to match the size of the object in the input sequence.', 'output': 'Create the output sequence by shifting each object in the input sequence to the corresponding position in the output sequence. Also, if necessary, adjust the size of the object in the output sequence to match the size of the object in the input sequence. Finally, set any remaining pixels in the output sequence to 0.'}, 'test_output': 'np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])'}}
