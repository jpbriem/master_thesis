            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe provided input-output pairs demonstrate a common transformation pattern where each object's size and position remain constant but its color changes. Specifically, an object's color can change to any other valid value (except for 0) in the input sequence. \n\nIn Example_1, the input sequence has two objects, one with color 2 at index 1-2 and another with color 3 at index 4-4. The output sequence also has two objects, both with color 6 at index 1-2 and 4-4 respectively.\n\nIn Example_2, the input sequence has three objects, one with color 3 at index 1-2, another with color 3 at index 4-4, and another with color 9 at index 7-7. The output sequence also has three objects, all with color 9 at index 1-2, 4-4, and 7-7 respectively.\n\nIn Example_3, the input sequence has four objects, one with color 5 at index 1-2, another with color 5 at index 4-4, another with color 7 at index 7-7, and another with color 0 at index 10-10. The output sequence also has four objects, all with color 7 at index 1-2, 4-4, 7-7, and 10-10 respectively.\n\nOverall Pattern:\nThe overall pattern of this transformation is that an object's color can change to any other valid value (except for 0). This means that any combination of objects with different colors can appear in the output sequence, as long as their positions and sizes remain unchanged.\n\nInstructions:\nTo transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and update their colors accordingly. If an object's color does not appear in the input sequence, it remains unchanged. You can create the resulting output sequence by iterating through the input sequence and updating the colors of the identified objects.\n\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nExplanation:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence: [Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}]\n  * Update the colors of the identified objects: [Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 8, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}]\n\nNote: The color 0 represents the background color, which does not appear in the input sequence and therefore remains unchanged.\n\nTest Output:\n[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
