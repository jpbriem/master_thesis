            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: In this example, we see two objects of the same color (3) located at positions (1, 2) and (4, 4). The first object has a size of 2x2 while the second object has a size of 1x1. The objects are moved to their final positions (1, 1) and (4, 4), respectively.\n  * Example_2: In this example, we see three objects of different colors (0, 1, and 2) located at positions (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3). The first object has a size of 1x1 while the second and third objects have a size of 2x2. The objects are removed from the input sequence.\n  * Example_3: In this example, we see four objects of the same color (0) located at positions (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4). The objects are scaled up to double their original size. As a result, the objects are now located at positions (2, 2), (4, 4), (6, 6), and (8, 8).\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * Each input sequence contains one or more objects of the same color.\n  * Objects can be moved, resized, copied, recolored, or removed from the input sequence.\n  * No noise pixels are present in the input sequence.\n  * The input sequence can be transformed using a combination of these operations.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and size.\n  * Determine the desired size and position of each object after transformation.\n  * Apply the appropriate transformation operation(s) to move, resize, copy, recolor, or remove objects from the input sequence.\n  * Create the resulting output sequence by applying the same transformation operations to each object.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Object Description: Two objects of the same color (3) located at positions (1, 2) and (4, 4).\n  * Transformed Objects: The first object should be moved to position (1, 1) and the second object should remain at position (4, 4).\n  * Output: [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNote: The input sequence does not contain any noise pixels."
