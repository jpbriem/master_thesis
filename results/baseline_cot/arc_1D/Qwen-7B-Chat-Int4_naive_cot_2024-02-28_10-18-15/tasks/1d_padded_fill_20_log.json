            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: The input sequence contains 18 objects, each represented by a number ranging from 0 to 9. The objects are arranged in two groups of nine objects each. The objects in the first group are aligned horizontally, while those in the second group are aligned vertically. The objects in the first group are also hollowed out, leaving only their outline visible. The objects in the second group are scaled down by half. The objects in both groups are colored differently. The output sequence has the same number of objects as the input sequence, but they are arranged differently. The objects in the first group are now placed one after another in a row, while those in the second group are still aligned vertically. However, the objects in the second group are now recolored to match the color scheme of the first group. The objects in both groups are now hollowed out, leaving only their outlines visible.\n  * Example_2: The input sequence contains 18 objects, each represented by a number ranging from 0 to 9. The objects are arranged in three rows of six objects each. The objects in the first row are aligned horizontally, while those in the second and third rows are aligned vertically. The objects in the first row are also hollowed out, leaving only their outline visible. The objects in the second and third rows are scaled up by twice. The objects in all three rows are colored differently. The output sequence has the same number of objects as the input sequence, but they are arranged differently. The objects in the first row are now placed one after another in a column, while those in the second and third rows are still aligned vertically. However, the objects in the second and third rows are now recolored to match the color scheme of the first row. The objects in all three rows are now hollowed out, leaving only their outlines visible.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * The overall pattern involves transforming an input sequence of pixels into an output sequence of pixels using a set of simple operations such as copying, scaling, recoloring, and hollowing out. These operations are applied to specific objects in the input sequence based on their position, size, color, and other characteristics. The transformed objects are then rearranged in a way that respects their original layout and color scheme.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n    1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their position, size, color, and other characteristics.\n    2. Apply the appropriate transformation operation to each object based on its properties and desired outcome.\n    3. Rearrange the transformed objects in a way that respects their original layout and color scheme.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * The transformation involves applying the following operations to the input sequence:\n\n    * Copy: Create a copy of an object and place it at the desired location in the output sequence.\n    * Scale: Resize an object by changing its dimensions.\n    * Recolor: Change the color of an object.\n    * Hollow: Remove the interior of an object, leaving only its outline.\n\nTest Output:\n\n  * The test output sequence should contain the same number of objects as the input sequence, but they should be arranged differently. The objects should be transformed according to the specified instructions, and the color scheme should be preserved where applicable."
