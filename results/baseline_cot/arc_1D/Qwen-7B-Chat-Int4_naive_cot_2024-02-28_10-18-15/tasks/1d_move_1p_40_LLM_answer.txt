prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern: The underlying transformation pattern involves copying and transforming objects to create the output sequence. Each object's color value determines its location in the output sequence, and the size of an object remains constant throughout the transformation process.
Instructions: To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.
  2. Copy each object and place it at its corresponding location in the output sequence.
  3. Transform the copied object's color value according to the specified pattern.

For example, if the input sequence has two objects, one colored blue (value 2) starting at index 0 and ending at index 5, and another colored red (value 3) starting at index 6 and ending at index 10, then the corresponding output sequence would have two objects, both colored blue (value 2), but placed at different locations than their original positions. The first object would be located at indices 0 through 5, and the second object would be located at indices 6 through 10.

Transformation: To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you can follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for consecutive groups of the same color value.
  2. Copy each group of the same color value and place them at their corresponding location in the output sequence.
  3. If any objects were removed or transformed during the copying process, update the output sequence accordingly.

For the given input sequence [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], there are four objects: three identical blue objects starting at index 0 and ending at index 4, and one identical red object starting at index 7 and ending at index 11. Therefore, the corresponding output sequence would have four objects, all colored blue, but placed at different locations than their original positions. The first object would be located at indices 0 through 4, the second object would be located at indices 5 through 9, the third object would be located at indices 10 through 14, and the fourth object would be located at indices 15 through 19.
