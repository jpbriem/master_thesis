prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has one object of color 8 and two objects of color 2. In the output sequence, these objects have been shifted to the left and their positions have been updated accordingly.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has one object of color 7 and four objects of color 5. In the output sequence, this object has been moved down and its position has been updated accordingly.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has five objects of color 9. These objects have been shifted to the right and their positions have been updated accordingly.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that each object in the input sequence is transformed according to some rule. The specific rule depends on the object itself, but it generally involves moving or resizing the object. This process continues until there are no more changes to make.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation rule to each object. You can follow the examples provided above to understand how to do this. Once you have applied all necessary transformations, the resulting output sequence will be identical to the output sequence shown in the examples.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.', 'object_description': 'For each object in the input sequence, describe its color, position, and size.', 'transformed_objects': 'For each transformed object, describe its new color, position, and size.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by applying the appropriate transformation rule to each object in the input sequence.'}, 'test_output': 'numpy.array([7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])'}
