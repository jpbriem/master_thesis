prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description of Example_1:

The input sequence has five zeros at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. These zeros represent the background color. There is one six at index 1, four fours at indices 3, 5, 7, and 9, and another six at index 3. 

In the output sequence, these zeros were replaced by sixes, so there are now two sixes instead of five zeros. This means that the objects at indices 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 were transformed into sixes. Therefore, this transformation moved the objects at those indices closer together.

Overall Pattern:

The overall pattern in these examples is that each object is moved closer together, with some objects being removed entirely. In Example_1, the objects at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 were moved closer together, while in Example_2, the object at index 7 was moved closer to the other objects. In Example_3, no objects were moved, but an additional object (a three) was added.

Instructions:

To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions. Then, you can apply the transformation pattern to move the objects closer together, removing any objects that do not fit within the desired arrangement. If you want to add an object, you can simply insert it into the appropriate position in the output sequence.

Transformation:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5]

Explanation: We identified the objects in the input sequence as the seven-sevens and the zero. We then moved the zero to the end of the sequence and inserted a five between the last two sevens. This resulted in the output sequence shown above.

Test Output:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5]
