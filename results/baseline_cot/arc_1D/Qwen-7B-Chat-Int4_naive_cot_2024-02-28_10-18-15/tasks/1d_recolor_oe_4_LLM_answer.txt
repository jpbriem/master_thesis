prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]

Sample Outputs:
Description:

  * Example_1 shows an object moving horizontally to the left and vertically up. It starts at (0, 0) and ends at (0, 5). Its original color was 9 and it's now 8.
  * Example_2 shows two objects moving towards each other. One starts at (0, 0), moves horizontally right, and then vertically down to (0, 2). Its original color was 0 and it's now 2. The second object starts at (2, 2), moves horizontally left, and then vertically up to (2, 4). Its original color was 9 and it's now 8.
  * Example_3 shows an object moving away from the center of the image. It starts at (0, 0), moves horizontally right, and then vertically down to (2, 2). Its original color was 9 and it's now 2.

Overall Pattern:

  * In each example, there is one object moving in some direction. The movement can be either horizontal, vertical, or both. The object may also change its color during the movement.
  * The transformation consists of changing the position and/or color of the object.

Instructions:

  * Identify the object(s) in the input sequence.
  * Determine the direction and magnitude of their movement.
  * Apply the necessary changes to the object's position and/or color to create the corresponding output sequence.

Transformation:

  * Input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Object Description: There are three objects in this input sequence.
    * Object_1: Position=(0, 0), Color=9, Size=6.
    * Object_2: Position=(0, 7), Color=9, Size=5.
    * Object_3: Position=(1, 1), Color=9, Size=6.
  * Transformed Objects: To obtain the corresponding output sequence, we need to apply the following transformations to the objects in the input sequence:
    * Object_1: Move horizontally to the left and vertically up. Its new position is (0, 5). Its new color is 8.
    * Object_2: Move horizontally right and vertically down. Its new position is (2, 2). Its new color is 2.
    * Object_3: Move horizontally right and vertically down. Its new position is (1, 4). Its new color is 2.

Output:

  * Create the resulting output sequence by applying the transformations to the objects in the input sequence. The output sequence should have the same number of elements as the input sequence.

Test Output:

  * Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Here is one possible solution:
```css
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Note that the above solution assumes that the input sequence has exactly 20 elements and that the objects in the input sequence are numbered starting from 0. If these assumptions do not hold true, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.
