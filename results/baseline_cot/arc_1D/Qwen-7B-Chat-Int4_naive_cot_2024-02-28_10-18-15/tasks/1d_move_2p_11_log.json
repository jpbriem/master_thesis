            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: The underlying transformation pattern involves copying an object multiple times in order to create new objects that contain the same data but with different positions or sizes. This pattern can also involve removing or hollowing out existing objects, as well as adding new objects to the sequence.\nInstructions: To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify any existing objects in the input sequence and their properties (size, position, color).\n  2. Determine the desired number of copies of each object that you want to create in the output sequence.\n  3. Create new objects for each copy using the information about the original objects.\n  4. Adjust the positions and/or sizes of the new objects as necessary to ensure they fit properly in the output sequence.\n  5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all desired objects have been created in the output sequence.\n\nTransformation: Here is an example of how to transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using this pattern:\n```css\n# Step 1: Identify existing objects and their properties\nobjects = [\n    {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 6},\n    {'color': 0, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 6}\n]\n\n# Step 2: Determine desired number of copies\nnum_copies = 2\n\n# Step 3: Create new objects\nnew_objects = []\nfor obj in objects:\n    # Copy the object twice\n    new_obj = obj.copy()\n    new_obj['start_index'] += num_copies * obj['size']\n    new_obj['end_index'] += num_copies * obj['size']\n    \n    # Add the new object to the list\n    new_objects.append(new_obj)\n\n# Step 4: Adjust positions and/or sizes\nfor i, obj in enumerate(new_objects):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        obj['position'] = [i + 1, 0]\n    else:\n        obj['position'] = [i - 1, 0]\n\n# Step 5: Repeat steps 2-4 until all desired objects have been created\nwhile len(new_objects) < num_copies:\n    # Find the next available position\n    free_positions = [obj['position'][1] for obj in new_objects if obj['position'][1] != 0]\n    if len(free_positions) > 0:\n        obj = new_objects.pop(0)\n        obj['position'][1] += 1\n        new_objects.append(obj)\n    else:\n        break\n\n# Step 6: Combine the new objects into a single sequence\noutput_sequence = np.zeros((len(objects), 2))\nfor i, obj in enumerate(new_objects):\n    output_sequence[obj['start_index']:obj['end_index'], 0] = obj['color']\n\nprint(output_sequence)\n```\n\nOutput: The resulting output sequence would be:\n```scss\n[[5 5]\n [5 5]]\n```\n\nNote that this output sequence contains two copies of the object represented by the color 5, each located at position (1, 0)."
