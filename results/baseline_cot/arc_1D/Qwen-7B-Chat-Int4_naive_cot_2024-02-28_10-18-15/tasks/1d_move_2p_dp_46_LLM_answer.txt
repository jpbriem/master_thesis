prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern:
The underlying transformation pattern in these examples involves moving objects from one location to another while preserving their original size and color. Specifically, it appears that each object is moved along a fixed direction (e.g., rightward) until it reaches a specific location where it remains stationary. This process is repeated for each object in the input sequence.
Instructions:
To transform the input into its output, we need to follow the steps outlined below:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the `object_description` field provided in the instructions.
  2. Move each object along a fixed direction (e.g., rightward) until it reaches a specific location where it remains stationary. We can do this by incrementing the x-coordinate of each object's starting index by the specified distance.
  3. Copy the remaining objects from the input sequence into the output sequence, preserving their original size and color.

Note that we should only move objects that are still present in the input sequence after the previous step has been performed. If an object is no longer present in the input sequence, we should simply copy it into the output sequence without making any further modifications.
Transformation:
Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Object Description: There are two objects in the input sequence. Object 1 starts at index 1 and ends at index 2, with a size of 2. Object 2 starts at index 4 and ends at index 4, with a size of 1.
Transformed Objects: Both objects should remain stationary at their current positions in the output sequence.
Output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Test Output:
[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
