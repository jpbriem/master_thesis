prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:

  * Example_1: In this example, the input sequence has two objects: one object with color 0 (background) and another object with color 1. The output sequence also has two objects, but they have different positions and sizes compared to their counterparts in the input sequence. Specifically, the object with color 1 in the output sequence is larger than in the input sequence and is positioned closer to the center of the image.
  * Example_2: This example has the same number of objects as the previous one, but the objects have been moved and resized differently. The object with color 2 in the output sequence is now located at the top-left corner of the image, while it was previously located in the bottom-right corner of the input sequence. Additionally, the object with color 2 in the output sequence is smaller than in the input sequence.
  * Example_3: In this example, there is only one object in both the input and output sequences, but the object's position has changed. The object with color 3 in the input sequence is located in the center of the image, while it is now located at the bottom of the output sequence.

Overall Pattern: All three input-output pairs share the same overall pattern of transforming an input sequence into an output sequence by changing the positions and/or sizes of objects in the input sequence. These changes can be achieved through various operations such as moving, resizing, copying, recoloring, etc.

Instructions: To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for adjacent pixels with the same color. Each object will consist of a set of pixels with the same color.
  2. Determine the size of each object by counting the number of pixels in the object.
  3. Move each object to its desired position in the output sequence. You can do this by shifting the object along a specified direction and/or distance.
  4. Resize each object if necessary. You can achieve this by scaling the object up or down by a specified factor.
  5. Recolor any pixels that are outside the bounds of the original object.

Transformation: Here is an example transformation action for the given test case:

```json
{
    "input": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
    "object_description": {
        "size": [6, 6],
        "position": [2, 2]
    },
    "transformed_objects": [
        {
            "color": 3,
            "size": [8, 8],
            "position": [0, 0]
        }
    ],
    "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}
```

In this example, we identify one object with color 3 in the input sequence, which consists of six pixels. We then move the object to the top-left corner of the output sequence by shifting it horizontally and vertically by one pixel. Finally, we resize the object to cover eight pixels in width and height.

Test Output: The transformed test output sequence would be:
```css
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
