            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ \"description\": { \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, there are two objects. Object_1 has a size of 2x2 and starts at index 1 and ends at index 2. Object_2 has a size of 2x2 and starts at index 4 and ends at index 4. In the input sequence, both objects are present. In the output sequence, both objects are also present but they are horizontally aligned.\", \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, there is one object. It has a size of 7x7 and starts at index 1 and ends at index 8. This object covers all the pixels from index 1 to index 8 inclusive.\" }, \"overall_pattern\": \"The overall pattern is that each input pixel can be transformed into an output pixel based on the presence of objects and their properties (size, position, color). If an object is present, it will cover the corresponding pixels in the output sequence. Otherwise, the corresponding pixels in the output sequence will remain unchanged. Additionally, the output sequence may contain noise pixels if the input sequence contains them. Finally, the output sequence may have additional pixels added to account for any missed objects in the input sequence.\", \"instructions\": \"To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects present in the input sequence.\n  2. Determine the positions and sizes of the objects.\n  3. Transform each pixel in the input sequence based on the presence and properties of the objects.\n    * If an object is present, the corresponding pixels in the output sequence will be filled with the color of the object's background.\n    * If an object is not present, the corresponding pixels in the output sequence will remain unchanged.\n  4. Add noise pixels to the output sequence if necessary.\n  5. Check for any missed objects in the input sequence and add additional pixels to the output sequence to account for them.\n\nFor example, let's consider the test case input sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1: Identify the objects present in the input sequence.\nThere are two objects in this input sequence. Object_1 has a size of 2x2 and starts at index 1 and ends at index 2. Object_2 has a size of 2x2 and starts at index 4 and ends at index 4.\n\nStep 2: Determine the positions and sizes of the objects.\nObject_1 starts at index 1 and ends at index 2, covering the pixels from index 1 to index 2 inclusive. Object_2 starts at index 4 and ends at index 4, covering the pixels from index 4 to index 4 inclusive.\n\nStep 3: Transform each pixel in the input sequence based on the presence and properties of the objects.\nSince both objects are present, we need to transform each pixel in the input sequence based on their properties.\n\n  * For the pixels covered by Object_1, we will fill them with the color of Object_1's background, which is 2.\n  * For the pixels covered by Object_2, we will fill them with the color of Object_2's background, which is also 2.\n\nTherefore, the output sequence will be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0]\n\nStep 4: Add noise pixels to the output sequence if necessary.\nThere are no noise pixels in this input sequence, so there are none in the output sequence either.\n\nStep 5: Check for any missed objects in the input sequence and add additional pixels to the output sequence to account for them.\nThere are no missed objects in this input sequence, so there are no additional pixels needed in the output sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final output sequence is:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0]\""
