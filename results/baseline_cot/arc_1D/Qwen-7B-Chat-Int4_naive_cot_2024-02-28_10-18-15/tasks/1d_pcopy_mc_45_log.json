            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: In this pattern, there are two main types of objects: those with size 2 (objects 1 and 2) and those with size 8 (objects 3 and 4). Each object has a specific color associated with it, and the objects can overlap or contain each other. Additionally, the transformation involves moving objects around and changing their color.\nInstructions: To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and their positions, then modify them according to the transformation pattern. Specifically:\n\n  * If an object is smaller than 2 units, it stays at its current position without any changes.\n  * If an object is larger than 2 units, it needs to be moved to another position where it fits correctly. You can do this by subtracting the size of the object from its current position until it reaches a valid position.\n  * If an object contains another object, you need to check if the contained object's position is valid after the movement of the containing object. If not, you need to adjust the position of the contained object accordingly.\n  * If an object is already in the correct position, but its color does not match the desired color, you need to change its color.\n\nFor example, in the test case input, the object with size 2 (object 1) is initially located at position (2, 2), but it should be moved to position (4, 4) to fit correctly. After moving the object, we also need to check if the object with size 8 (object 3) is contained in the object with size 2 (object 1). Since it is not, we need to adjust the position of object 3 so that it is contained within object 1. Finally, since object 3 now has the desired color, no further action is needed for this object.\nTransformation: Here is an example of transforming the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence:\n```css\ninput = [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n# Identify objects\nobjects = [\n    {\"size\": 2, \"start_index\": 0, \"end_index\": 2},\n    {\"size\": 8, \"start_index\": 4, \"end_index\": 6}\n]\n# Move object 1 to position (4, 4)\ninput[2:4] = [4, 4]\n# Adjust position of object 3 to be contained within object 1\ninput[4:6] += [0, 2]\n# Change color of object 3 to match desired color\ninput[4:6][1] = 3\n\noutput = input\n```\n\nTest Output: The transformed output sequence would be:\n```css\noutput = [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```"
