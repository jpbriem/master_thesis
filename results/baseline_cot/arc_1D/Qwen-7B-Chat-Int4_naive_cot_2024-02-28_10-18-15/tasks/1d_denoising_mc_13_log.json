            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 9, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 7, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern:\n\nIn these examples, there seems to be a pattern where an object with a specific color and position is present in the input sequence and it remains unchanged in the output sequence. This means that any other objects that may appear in the input sequence do not affect the presence or movement of this specific object. \n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform a new input into its output, we need to identify the object(s) present in the input sequence and check if they remain unchanged in the output sequence. If so, we can assume that no action needs to be taken on those objects. If an object appears in both the input and output sequences but has a different color or position, then we can perform one of the following actions:\n\n- Recolor: Change the color of the object to match the color in the output sequence.\n- Move: Shift the object's position to match the position in the output sequence.\n- Remove: Remove the object from the input sequence.\n- Copy: Create a duplicate of the object at the desired location in the output sequence.\n\nOnce we've identified the necessary actions, we can apply them to the input sequence to obtain the output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    # Identify objects\n    objects = []\n    for i in range(len(input_sequence)):\n        if input_sequence[i] != 0:\n            obj = {\"color\": input_sequence[i], \"start_index\": i}\n            objects.append(obj)\n    \n    # Check if objects remain unchanged\n    unchanged_objects = []\n    for obj in objects:\n        index = -1\n        for j in range(len(output_sequence)):\n            if output_sequence[j] == obj[\"color\"]:\n                index = j\n                break\n        if index != -1:\n            unchanged_objects.append({\"obj\": obj, \"index\": index})\n    \n    # Apply transformation actions\n    for obj in unchanged_objects:\n        if obj[\"obj\"][\"color\"] != output_sequence[obj[\"index\"]]:\n            output_sequence[obj[\"index\"]] = obj[\"obj\"][\"color\"]\n    \n    return output_sequence\n\ninput_sequence = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\nprint(transform(input_sequence))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```csharp\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```"
