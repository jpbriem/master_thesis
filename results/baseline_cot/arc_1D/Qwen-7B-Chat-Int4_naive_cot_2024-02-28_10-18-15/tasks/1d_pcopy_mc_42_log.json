            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern:\nThe input-output pairs follow a simple transformation pattern where each object (represented by a contiguous block of equal-colored pixels) undergoes a series of operations, including movement, scaling, and recoloring, depending on its location and size relative to other objects. Additionally, noise pixels may be added or removed, and the number of objects can change over time. \n\nInstructions:\nTo transform an input image into its corresponding output, one must identify the objects present in the input image, determine their size, position, and color, apply appropriate transformation operations to them, and ensure that no noise pixels remain in the final output image. It's important to note that this process involves both logical reasoning and careful attention to detail, as small mistakes can lead to significant differences between the input and output images.\n\nTransformation:\nInput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nObject Description:\nThere are two objects in this input image:\n\n  * Object_1: A large rectangular shape of color 9, located at indices [1, 2], covering a total area of 3x3 pixels.\n  * Object_2: A smaller square shape of color 6, located at index [5], covering a total area of 1x1 pixels.\n\nOutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTransformed Objects:\nTo transform the input image into its corresponding output, we need to perform the following operations:\n\n  * Move Object_2 to the left by 1 pixel, so it now covers the entire width of the row at index [5].\n  * Scale Object_1 down by a factor of 2 vertically, so it now covers half the height of the previous row at indices [1, 2].\n  * Recolor Object_1 to color 8, since it was originally yellow.\n  * Remove any remaining noise pixels.\n\nNote that these transformations do not affect the number of objects present in the input image, but they result in a significantly different output image than the original input.\n\nOutput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTest Output:\n[0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
