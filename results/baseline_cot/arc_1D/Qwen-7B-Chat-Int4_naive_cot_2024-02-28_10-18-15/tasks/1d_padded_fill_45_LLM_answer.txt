prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
The underlying transformation pattern for these examples involves transforming an input sequence of pixels into an output sequence of pixels through various operations, including moving, copying, recoloring, etc. The specific details of each operation depend on the objects present in the input sequence and their relationships with each other. 

In general, the transformation process can be broken down into several steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input sequence: This involves identifying regions of the image that represent the same object. In this case, objects are defined as groups of pixels that have the same color and occupy adjacent positions in the input sequence.

2. Move objects: If there are any overlapping objects in the input sequence, they need to be moved apart to avoid conflicts. This can involve resizing the objects or repositioning them relative to each other.

3. Copy objects: Some objects may need to be copied multiple times to create additional copies of the same object. This can involve either creating new objects or duplicating existing ones.

4. Recolor objects: If necessary, some objects may need to be recolored to match the desired output sequence. This can involve changing the color of individual pixels or entire regions of the image.

5. Remove objects: Finally, any unnecessary objects in the input sequence should be removed to ensure that the output sequence contains only the required objects.

Overall, the transformation pattern for these examples involves applying these various operations in a systematic way to transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence.
