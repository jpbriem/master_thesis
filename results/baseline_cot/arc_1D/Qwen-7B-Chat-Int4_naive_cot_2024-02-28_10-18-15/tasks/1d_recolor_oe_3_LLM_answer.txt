prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, we can see that the input sequence has two groups of three identical objects (represented by color 3). The output sequence shows the same objects but with their sizes increased by one. This means that each object was copied and then scaled up by a factor of 2.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, we can see that the input sequence consists of a single object represented by color 0, surrounded by four objects represented by color 3. The output sequence shows the same objects but with their positions shifted to the right by one. This means that the object was moved horizontally by one position.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, we can see that the input sequence has two groups of three identical objects (represented by color 3), each group separated by an empty space represented by color 0. The output sequence shows the same objects but without any empty spaces between them. This means that the objects were removed and then repositioned so that they are no longer separated by empty spaces.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All input-output pairs follow the same pattern where the objects in the input sequences are transformed in some way and the result is shown in the output sequences. The specific transformation depends on the input sequence and the desired output.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation to each object. You can use the provided examples as guidance to understand the transformation process. Once you have transformed all the objects, you will get the final output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regard the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color. In this case, there are three types of objects: color 0, color 3, and an empty space represented by color 0.', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color. In this case, the objects should remain unchanged except for the empty space represented by color 0, which should be removed. Also, the two groups of color 3 objects should be combined into a single group, and the object represented by color 0 should be placed in the middle of this group. Finally, the color of the objects should be adjusted to match the output sequence.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': '[[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]'}

                while index < len(input_sequence) and input_sequence[index] == 3:
                    index += 1

            else:

    return np.array(output_sequence)

# Test the function
input_sequence = np.array([0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3])
print(transform(input_sequence))
```

Output:
```css
array([[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6],
       [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
