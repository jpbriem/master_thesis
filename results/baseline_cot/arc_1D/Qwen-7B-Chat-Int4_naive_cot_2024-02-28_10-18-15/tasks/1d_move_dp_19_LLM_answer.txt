prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the objects have been moved horizontally and vertically.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the object has been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the object has been scaled down by a factor of 2.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The input-output relationship can be summarized as follows: given an input sequence, there exists at least one object. This object can be moved, rotated, scaled up or down, copied, recolored, hollowed out, removed, or combined with other objects. No noise pixels exist. There may be multiple objects of the same type. The order of the objects does not matter. Objects can overlap with each other. The number of objects can vary depending on the input sequence. The arithmetics (counting, sorting) can be applied to objects or entire sequences. Conditional statements may also apply.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

  * Identify any objects in the input sequence.
  * Move, rotate, scale up or down, copy, recolor, hollow out, remove, or combine the identified objects as desired.
  * Ensure that no noise pixels remain in the output sequence.
  * Repeat the above steps until you have reached the desired output sequence.

Note that the order of the objects does not matter, and that the number of objects can vary depending on the input sequence. Also note that the arithmetics (counting, sorting) can be applied to objects or entire sequences.
