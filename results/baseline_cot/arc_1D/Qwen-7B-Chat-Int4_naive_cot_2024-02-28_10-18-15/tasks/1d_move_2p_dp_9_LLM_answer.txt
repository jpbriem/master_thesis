prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects. Object_1 consists of six consecutive pixels with value 2. Object_2 consists of one pixel with value 6. In the output sequence, both objects remain unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has three objects. Object_1 consists of seven consecutive pixels with value 7. Object_2 consists of one pixel with value 6. Object_3 consists of five consecutive pixels with value 5. In the output sequence, all objects remain unchanged except for object_1 which is shifted one position to the right.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has one object. Object_1 consists of eight consecutive pixels with value 5. In the output sequence, the object remains unchanged.' }, ' overall_pattern': 'All examples follow the same transformation pattern: for each pixel in the input sequence, if it is equal to the background color (0), nothing changes. Otherwise, if the pixel belongs to an existing object, the object is shifted according to the distance between the current pixel and the next pixel in the object. If the pixel does not belong to any existing object, a new object is created with the current pixel as its center and the number of pixels in the object being equal to the number of pixels in the object immediately before it. Finally, the pixel value is updated to reflect the new location of the object.', ' instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to iterate over the input sequence and perform the following steps:

  * Check if the current pixel is equal to the background color (0). If so, do nothing.
  * Check if the current pixel belongs to an existing object. If so, calculate the distance between the current pixel and the next pixel in the object using the Euclidean distance formula. Shift the object along this direction until the current pixel becomes equal to the background color. Update the pixel value to reflect the new location of the object.
  * If the current pixel does not belong to any existing object, create a new object with the current pixel as its center and the number of pixels in the object being equal to the number of pixels in the object immediately before it. Update the pixel value to reflect the new location of the object.

Once you have iterated over the entire input sequence, you will have obtained the corresponding output sequence.' }, 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]' }
