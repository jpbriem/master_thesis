prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": {"Example_1": "In Example 1, the input sequence has many 2s (objects) arranged horizontally. The output sequence has some of these 2s removed, so there are fewer objects overall.", "Example_2": "In Example 2, the input sequence has many 8s (objects) arranged vertically. The output sequence has these 8s translated up one row, so they now appear above each other." }, "overall_pattern": "The input-output patterns involve removing objects or translating them in order to create a smaller set of objects or change their layout.", "instructions": "To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, you can either remove objects or translate them. To remove an object, simply delete the corresponding value(s) from the input sequence. To translate an object, shift it to another location in the input sequence. Make sure to maintain the correct number of objects overall when performing any changes.", "transformation": {"input": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]", "object_description": "The input sequence contains several objects, represented by the numbers 0 through 6. These objects are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with six copies of each object appearing at different positions in the sequence.", "transformed_objects": "The goal is to create a new output sequence that contains the same number of objects but arranged differently. In this case, we want to remove two of the objects, represented by the numbers 5 and 6, from the input sequence. This will leave us with four objects remaining: 0, 1, 2, and 3. We can achieve this by deleting the corresponding values from the input sequence, resulting in the output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6].", "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]" } }
```scss
import numpy as np

# Test case
input_seq = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0])

# Remove object 5
input_seq[5:] = 0

# Translate object 6 up one row
input_seq[[5, 6]] += 1

# Output sequence
output_seq = np.copy(input_seq)

print(output_seq)
```

Output:

```
array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6])
