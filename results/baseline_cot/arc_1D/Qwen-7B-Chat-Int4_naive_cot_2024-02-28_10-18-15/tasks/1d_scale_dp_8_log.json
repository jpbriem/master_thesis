            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0]\noutput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains two objects of the same color, each occupying four consecutive pixels. The output sequence has the same structure but with an additional object of the same color at the beginning, filling up five consecutive pixels. This indicates that the transformation adds an object at the beginning of the sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains one object of three consecutive pixels of a different color than the other objects. The output sequence has the same structure but with the different-colored object replaced by another identical object. This indicates that the transformation replaces a specific object with another of the same type.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'In both examples, the input sequence contains several objects of the same color, which can be moved, resized, or modified in some way to create the output sequence. The transformation involves adding or removing objects, replacing existing ones, or modifying their properties such as color or position.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into its output, follow these steps:', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task and label the objects accordingly.', 'object_description': 'Label the objects in the input sequence according to their properties such as color, size, and position.', 'transformed_objects': 'Based on the transformation pattern observed in the examples, modify the objects in the input sequence as necessary to create the output sequence. For instance, if you want to add an object at the beginning of the sequence, insert it before the first object in the input sequence. If you want to replace a specific object with another of the same type, swap them in the input sequence. Be sure to preserve the order of the objects and update their properties as necessary.', 'output': 'Create the final output sequence by applying the modifications made to the input sequence. Make sure to preserve the order of the objects and update their properties as necessary.}' }\n{ 'test_output': 'numpy.array([3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0])' }"
