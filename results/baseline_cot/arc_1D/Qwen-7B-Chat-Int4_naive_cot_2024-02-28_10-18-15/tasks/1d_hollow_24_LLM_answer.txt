prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": { "Example_1": "Objects: There are two objects. Object_1 has size 8, starts at index 1 and ends at index 9. Object_2 has size 1, starts at index 10 and ends at index 10. Transformation: Move object_1 to the left.", "Example_2": "Objects: There are three objects. Object_1 has size 5, starts at index 1 and ends at index 6. Object_2 has size 5, starts at index 7 and ends at index 12. Object_3 has size 5, starts at index 13 and ends at index 18. Transformation: Scale object_1 by a factor of 2, then move it up.", "Example_3": "Objects: There are five objects. Object_1 has size 10, starts at index 1 and ends at index 11. Object_2 has size 10, starts at index 12 and ends at index 22. Object_3 has size 10, starts at index 23 and ends at index 33. Object_4 has size 10, starts at index 34 and ends at index 44. Object_5 has size 10, starts at index 45 and ends at index 55. Transformation: Remove object_1, object_4, and object_5." }, "overall_pattern": "In each example, there is an input sequence of pixels and an expected output sequence of pixels. The transformation involves moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, or some combination of these operations on the objects in the input sequence to produce the output sequence.", "instructions": "To transform a new input into its corresponding output, follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.
  2. Determine the desired action(s) to be performed on the objects (move, scale, remove, copy, recolor).
  3. Apply the chosen action(s) to the objects in the input sequence to obtain the output sequence.

For example, if you want to transform Example_1's input sequence into its output sequence, you would identify the two objects and apply the move operation to move Object_1 to the left. If you want to transform Example_2's input sequence into its output sequence, you would identify the three objects and apply the scale operation to scale Object_1 by a factor of 2 and move it up. And so on.
