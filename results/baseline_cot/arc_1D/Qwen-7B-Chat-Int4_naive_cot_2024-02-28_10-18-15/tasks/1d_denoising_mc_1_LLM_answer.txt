prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, there are two objects: one is a group of five pixels (objects 1 and 2), and another is a single pixel (object 3). In the input sequence, these objects occupy consecutive positions starting from index 1 and ending at index 6. The output sequence shows the same objects but in a different order, where object 3 is now at index 1.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, there are three objects: two groups of four pixels (objects 1 and 2) and one pixel (object 3). These objects also occupy consecutive positions starting from index 1 and ending at index 5. However, in the output sequence, the objects are rearranged so that they form a triangle shape.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, there are six objects: two groups of four pixels (objects 1 and 2), two groups of three pixels (objects 3 and 4), and one pixel (object 5). These objects also occupy consecutive positions starting from index 1 and ending at index 8. However, in the output sequence, the objects are rearranged so that they form an hourglass shape.'}, 'Overall_pattern': 'All input-output pairs follow a similar pattern: objects can be moved, resized, or removed, and noise pixels can be added or subtracted. The transformation process involves counting and comparing the number of objects and their positions in both the input and output sequences.', 'Instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence, determine their sizes and positions, and apply the appropriate transformation actions accordingly. You can count and compare the number of objects and their positions in both the input and output sequences to ensure that the transformation has been correctly applied. Finally, you need to add or subtract any noise pixels to complete the transformation process.', 'Transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence by looking for contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. Focus on the size, position, and color of each object.', 'transformed_objects': 'Apply the appropriate transformation actions to each object based on the given instructions. Move, resize, or remove objects as necessary, and add or subtract noise pixels if required. Pay attention to the position and orientation of each object when applying transformations.', 'output': 'Create the transformed output sequence by applying the appropriate transformation actions to each object in the input sequence. Make sure that the resulting sequence has the correct length and contains the transformed objects according to the specified instructions. Mind the position and orientation of each object when creating the output sequence.'}, 'Test_output': 'Return the transformed output sequence in numpy array format. Make sure that the resulting sequence has the correct length and contains the transformed objects according to the specified instructions. Mind the position and orientation of each object when returning the output sequence.'}
