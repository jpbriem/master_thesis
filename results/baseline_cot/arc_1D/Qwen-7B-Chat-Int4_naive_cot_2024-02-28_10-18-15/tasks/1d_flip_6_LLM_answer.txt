prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

The output sequence contains one object, which consists of two copies of the background color (0).', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains one object, which consists of five copies of the background color (0) and two copies of the foreground color (5). The output sequence removes the object.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains one object, which consists of seven copies of the background color (0) and one copy of the foreground color (7). The output sequence moves the object one index towards the right.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In all examples, the input sequence contains at least one object. The output sequence removes, moves, scales, or copies the object(s), depending on the transformation rule applied. The number of objects may change between input and output sequences. The positions and sizes of the objects do not necessarily remain the same.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence.
  * Determine the action to be taken on each object, based on the transformation rule applied.
  * Apply the chosen actions to each object in the input sequence to create the output sequence.

For example, if the transformation rule is to remove objects, then identify all objects in the input sequence and delete them from the output sequence. If the transformation rule is to move objects, then determine the new positions for each object and update the output sequence accordingly. If the transformation rule involves scaling or copying objects, then apply the chosen operation to each object in the input sequence to create the output sequence.
