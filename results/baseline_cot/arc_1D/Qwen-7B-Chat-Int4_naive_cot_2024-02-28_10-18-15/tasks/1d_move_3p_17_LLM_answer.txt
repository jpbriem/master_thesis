prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The transformation pattern shared among these examples involves removing noise pixels from an input sequence. Specifically, each input sequence contains 8 objects, represented by a series of 8 consecutive ones (i.e., 1s). The output sequence consists of the remaining non-zero pixels after removing any adjacent zeros (i.e., 0s).
To transform the given test case input into its corresponding output sequence, we can follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the presence of consecutive ones (i.e., 1s) separated by zeros (i.e., 0s).

```python
objects = []
for i in range(8):
    if input[i:i+8].count(1) == 8:
        objects.append({"color": 1, "start_index": i, "end_index": i + 7, "size": 8})
```

In this example, there are two objects: one starting at index 0 and ending at index 7, and another starting at index 5 and ending at index 12.

  2. Remove the noise pixels from the input sequence by replacing them with the background color (0).

```python
output_sequence = input.copy()
for object in objects:
    start_index = object["start_index"]
    end_index = object["end_index"]
    output_sequence[start_index:end_index] = 0
```

In this example, we replace the 0s in the input sequence with 0s to create the output sequence.

  3. Verify that the output sequence matches the expected output.

```python
assert np.allclose(output_sequence, [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
```

In this example, we check that the output sequence has no more than 8 consecutive 1s (i.e., 8 objects), just like the expected output sequence. If the output sequence does not match the expected output, it means that there was a mistake in the previous steps, and further investigation may be necessary.
