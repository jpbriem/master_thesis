prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'Objects are moved horizontally.', 'Example_2': 'Objects are copied horizontally.', 'Example_3': 'Objects are scaled vertically.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In each example, the input sequence contains objects with specific positions and sizes. In the output sequence, these objects are transformed according to a specific rule. In Example 1, objects are moved horizontally; in Example 2, they are copied horizontally; in Example 3, they are scaled vertically.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the corresponding transformation rule. In this case, the objects are moved horizontally (in Example 1), copied horizontally (in Example 2), or scaled vertically (in Example 3). You can do this by iterating over the input sequence and applying the transformation rule to each object individually. Once you have transformed all objects, you can create the output sequence by concatenating the transformed objects together.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'For each object in the input sequence, identify its start index and end index, as well as its color. Note that the color value is represented using a single digit from 1 to 9, inclusive.', 'transformed_objects': 'For each object in the input sequence, apply the corresponding transformation rule. In this case, if the object is moved horizontally, shift it one space to the left; if it is copied horizontally, duplicate it and place it one space to the right of the original object; if it is scaled vertically, multiply its height by 2 and keep its width unchanged.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by concatenating the transformed objects together. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'numpy.array([[[0, 0], [0, 6]], [[6, 6], [6, 0]]])'}
