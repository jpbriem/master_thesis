prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has 18 identical pixels (represented by the value 2) and one non-pixel object (represented by the value 0). In the output sequence, the non-pixel object is removed and the remaining pixels are rearranged so that they form two groups of nine identical pixels each. This corresponds to the action of removing an object followed by a scaling operation.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has 17 identical pixels (represented by the value 1) and one non-pixel object (represented by the value 0). In the output sequence, the non-pixel object is removed and the remaining pixels are rearranged so that they form four groups of four identical pixels each. This corresponds to the action of removing an object followed by a scaling operation.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence consists of three objects: two identical pixels represented by the value 5 and one non-pixel object represented by the value 0. In the output sequence, these objects are rearranged so that the non-pixel object is moved to the center of the sequence, while the other two objects are shifted towards the edges. This corresponds to the action of moving an object followed by a scaling operation.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'All input-output pairs share the same overall pattern of removing non-pixel objects and rearranging the remaining pixels to create multiple groups of identical pixels. Depending on the specific arrangement of the input sequence, this can result in various outputs, including ones where the objects are arranged in a grid-like pattern or in a linear fashion.', 'instructions': 'To transform a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to follow these steps:

  * Identify any non-pixel objects in the input sequence.
  * Remove these objects from the input sequence.
  * Rearrange the remaining pixels to create multiple groups of identical pixels. You can do this by shifting the pixels closer together or further apart, depending on the desired layout.

Once you have completed these steps, you will have obtained the output sequence for the given input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'The input sequence consists of 18 identical pixels (represented by the value 2), one non-pixel object (represented by the value 0), and one additional pixel (represented by the value 6).'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0]' }
