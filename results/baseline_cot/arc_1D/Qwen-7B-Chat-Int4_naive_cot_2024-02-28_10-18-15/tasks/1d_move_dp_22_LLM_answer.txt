prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence consists of 8 pixels where 5 of them are identical (value 3). The output sequence also has 8 pixels but only one of them is identical (value 0) and it appears at index 1. This means that in the input sequence there are two objects, one with value 3 and starting at index 1 and ending at index 5, and another object with value 0 and starting at index 7.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence consists of 16 pixels where 15 of them are identical (value 7). The output sequence also has 16 pixels but only one of them is identical (value 7) and it appears at index 1. This means that in the input sequence there are two objects, one with value 7 and starting at index 1 and ending at index 15, and another object with value 0 and starting at index 17.', 'Overall_pattern': 'In both examples, the input and output sequences have the same number of pixels and the same number of unique values. However, in the output sequence, some of the pixels that were previously identical have been replaced by other pixels with different values. Additionally, in both examples, the number of objects in the input sequence is equal to the number of unique values in the output sequence. The objects in the input sequence are arranged in a specific order, with each object covering a contiguous range of indices in the input sequence. In the output sequence, the objects are rearranged so that they cover the same range of indices, but with some objects being merged together or split apart.'}, 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and arrange them in the correct order. Once you have identified the objects, you can replace the pixels in the input sequence with the corresponding pixels from the output sequence. You can do this by iterating over the input sequence and replacing each pixel with the corresponding pixel from the output sequence. If there are multiple objects overlapping in an area of the input sequence, you will need to decide which object covers that area. In general, you want to make sure that the resulting output sequence has the same number of pixels and unique values as the input sequence, and that the objects in the output sequence are arranged in the same order as the objects in the input sequence, with each object covering a contiguous range of indices in the input sequence.'}, 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'In the input sequence, identify the objects and their positions in the sequence. Each object should be represented by a tuple containing the start and end indices of the object in the input sequence. There may be multiple objects in the input sequence if some pixels are identical.', 'transformed_objects': 'For each object in the input sequence, find the corresponding object in the output sequence and replace the pixels in the input sequence with the corresponding pixels from the output sequence.
