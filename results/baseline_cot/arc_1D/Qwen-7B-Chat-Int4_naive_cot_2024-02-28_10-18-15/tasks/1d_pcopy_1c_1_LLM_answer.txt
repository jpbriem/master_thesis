prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The transformation pattern for these input-output pairs is:

- Objects can be moved horizontally or vertically by changing their starting index.
- Objects can be scaled up or down by multiplying their size by a constant factor.
- Objects can be removed by setting their size to zero.
- Objects can be copied by creating a new object at the same location.
- Objects can be recolored by changing their color value.

To transform the given test case, we can follow these steps:

- Move the object at index 4 (color 6) one position to the left, so it starts at index 3.
- Scale the object at index 3 up by a factor of two, so its size becomes 8.
- Remove the object at index 6 (color 6).
- Copy the object at index 4 (color 6) twice at indices 7 and 8.
- Recolor the object at index 7 (color 8) to yellow.

Therefore, the transformed output sequence would be:
[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

So the JSON response for this test case would be:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has two objects: Object_1 (color 2, size 2) and Object_2 (color 3, size 1). The output sequence also has two objects: Object_1' (color 2, size 2) and Object_2' (color 3, size 1), but they are shifted horizontally and vertically compared to their counterparts in the input sequence.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence has four objects: Object_1 (color 5, size 5), Object_2 (color 5, size 5), Object_3 (color 5, size 5), and Object_4 (color 5, size 5). The output sequence also has four objects: Object_1' (color 5, size 5), Object_2' (color 5, size 5), Object_3' (color 5, size 5), and Object_4' (color 5, size 5), but they are shifted horizontally and vertically compared to their counterparts in the input sequence."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Objects can be moved, scaled, removed, copied, and recolored. These operations can change the size, position, and color of an object.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation operations to them. You can move an object by changing its starting index, scale it up or down by multiplying its size by a constant factor, remove it by setting its size to zero, copy it by creating a new object at the same location, and recolor it by changing its color value.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
        "object_description": "Identify the objects in the input sequence. In this case, there are five objects: Object_1 (color 6, size 6), Object_2 (color 6, size 6), Object_3 (color 6, size 6), Object_4 (color 6, size 6), and Object_5 (color 6, size 6).",
        "transformed_objects": "Transform each object according to the instructions above. In this case, Object_1' (color 6, size 8), Object_2' (color 6, size 8), Object_3' (color 6, size 8), Object_4' (color 6, size 8), and Object_5' (color 6, size 8) are obtained after applying the transformation operations to the original objects.",
        "output": "[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
    },
    "test_output": "[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}
```

Note that the `test_output` field contains the actual output sequence generated by the transformation process.
