prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": { "Example_1": "In Example_1, what changes happened to the input sequence? How did it become the output sequence?", "Example_2": "In Example_2, what changes happened to the input sequence? How did it become the output sequence?" }, "overall_pattern": "What is the general pattern in these input-output pairs? What do they have in common?", "instructions": "How can we transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence? Think step by step.", "transformation": {"input": "[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]", "object_description": "Regarding the input sequence, describe the objects in terms of their size, position, and color.", "transformed_objects": "Describe how the objects should look like in the output sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.", "output": "[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]" }, "test_output": "[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]" } }
The general pattern in these input-output pairs is that adjacent pixels of the same color are considered as an object, while zero-indexing is used for the position. In each example, the input sequence contains multiple objects of the same color, and the output sequence removes some of them or transforms them in various ways (e.g., moving, scaling, removing). To transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, one needs to identify the objects in the input sequence and then apply the appropriate transformation rules to them. For instance, in Example_1, two objects are identified (one with color 2 and another with color 0), and the former is removed from the output sequence, leaving only the latter. Similarly, in Example_2, three objects are identified (two with color 2 and one with color 0), and the second object is moved to the right of the third one, creating a new object with color 2 at the center. Finally, in Example_3, four objects are identified (three with color 7 and one with color 0), and the first two objects are scaled down by half, creating two smaller objects with color 7. Therefore, the transformed output sequence for the given input sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0].
