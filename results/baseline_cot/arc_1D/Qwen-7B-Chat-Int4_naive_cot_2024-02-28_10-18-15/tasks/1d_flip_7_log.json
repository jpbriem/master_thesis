            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 4 and size 6 (from index 1 to index 7) and Object_2 with color 5 and size 1 (from index 8 to index 14). The transformation applied to the input sequence is moving Object_1 towards the left by one index.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, there is only one object: Object_1 with color 1 and size 14 (from index 1 to index 15). The transformation applied to the input sequence is scaling Object_1 down by half.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, there are two objects: Object_1 with color 1 and size 14 (from index 1 to index 15) and Object_2 with color 8 and size 1 (from index 16 to index 22). The transformation applied to the input sequence is copying Object_1 to the right and then removing it from the original location.', 'Overall_pattern': 'All input-output pairs follow the same transformation pattern where an object can be moved, scaled, copied, recolored, removed, or filled with a constant value. Additionally, there may be conditions that determine the specific transformation performed on each object.'}, 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation action to each object. Here is a step-by-step guide:\n\n  1. Identify the objects present in the input sequence.\n  2. Determine the type of transformation required for each object.\n  3. Apply the transformation to each object.\n  4. Check if any further actions are required based on the conditions specified in the task.\n  5. Create the final output sequence.\n\nFor example, consider the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. There are two objects: Object_1 with color 4 and size 6 (from index 1 to index 7) and Object_2 with color 5 and size 1 (from index 8 to index 14).\n  * To move Object_1 towards the left by one index, we would create a new output sequence with Object_1 starting at index 2 instead of index 1.\n  * To scale Object_1 down by half, we would create a new output sequence with Object_1 having half the size of its original size.\n  * To copy Object_1 to the right and then remove it from the original location, we would create a new output sequence with Object_1 starting at index 15 and Object_2 starting at index 14.\n  * To fill Object_1 with a constant value of 0, we would create a new output sequence with Object_1 replaced by 0s.\n  * If no further actions are required, the final output sequence would be the updated input sequence.\n  * It's important to note that these are just examples and the actual transformation actions may vary depending on the specific input and output sequences provided in the task."
