prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": { "Example_1": "In Example 1, the input sequence has no objects. The output sequence contains one object with the same color as the input sequence but with a larger size.", "Example_2": "In Example 2, the input sequence has two objects with the same color and position. The output sequence contains three objects with the same color and position as the input sequence, but with a smaller size." }, "overall_pattern": "The input-output patterns follow the following general rule: Each pixel in the input sequence corresponds to an object in the output sequence. If a pixel in the input sequence is black (0), then there is no corresponding object in the output sequence. If a pixel in the input sequence is white (9), then it becomes part of the largest object in the output sequence. Otherwise, if a pixel in the input sequence is any other value (1 through 8), then it forms a new object in the output sequence with the same color as the input pixel. The size of each object in the output sequence depends on the number of adjacent pixels with the same color as the input pixel. The position of each object in the output sequence depends on the relative positions of the adjacent pixels with the same color as the input pixel. The order of the objects in the output sequence does not matter." }, "instructions": "To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and create the corresponding objects in the output sequence. You can do this by iterating over the input sequence and checking whether each pixel is black or white. If it is black, then there is no corresponding object in the output sequence. If it is white, then it becomes part of the largest object in the output sequence. Otherwise, if it is any other value, then it forms a new object in the output sequence with the same color as the input pixel. You also need to keep track of the size and position of each object in the output sequence. To do this, you can count the number of adjacent pixels with the same color as the input pixel and use that information to determine the size and position of the corresponding object in the output sequence. Finally, you need to make sure that the order of the objects in the output sequence is correct. This means that the output sequence should contain exactly one object for every pixel in the input sequence that is not black." , "transformation": {"input": "[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]", "object_description": "There are four objects in the input sequence. They are represented by the numbers 1 through 4. Object 1 starts at index 0 and ends at index 1. Object 2 starts at index 2 and ends at index 3. Object 3 starts at index 4 and ends at index 5. Object 4 starts at index 6 and ends at index 7. Object 4 is the largest object in the input sequence.", "transformed_objects": "The transformed output sequence will contain five objects. They are represented by the numbers 1 through 5. Object 1 starts at index 0 and ends at index 1. Object 2 starts at index 2 and ends at index 3. Object 3 starts at index 4 and ends at index 5. Object 4 starts at index 6 and ends at index 7. Object 5 starts at index 8 and ends at index 9. Object 5 is the largest object in the output sequence.", "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]" } , "test_output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]" }
