            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nOverall Pattern: The transformation pattern involves copying an object at index n to index m (where n < m) and replacing it with another object of the same color. This process may be repeated multiple times to create a desired output sequence.\nInstructions: To transform a new input into its output, you can follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence using the `object_description` field.\n  2. Determine the location of each object in the input sequence using the `start_index` and `end_index` fields.\n  3. Copy the object at index n to index m (where n < m).\n  4. Replace the copied object with another object of the same color.\n\nFor example, if the input sequence has two objects, one at index 1 with a red color and one at index 7 with a blue color, and you want to replace the blue object at index 7 with a green object, you would perform the following steps:\n\n  1. Describe the objects in the input sequence as [Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 7, size: 3}].\n  2. Determine the locations of the objects as [Object_1: [1, 2], Object_2: [4, 7]].\n  3. Copy the blue object at index 7 to index 8 (since there is no other object at index 8), creating a new object at index 8 with a blue color.\n  4. Replace the blue object at index 8 with a green object, creating a new object at index 8 with a green color.\n\nTransformed Objects: The transformed objects will have the same color and size as the original objects but will be located differently in the output sequence. Specifically, the objects will be shifted towards the right until they reach their final positions. In Example 1, the output sequence will have two objects, one at index 1 with a red color and one at index 7 with a green color.\nOutput: The transformed output sequence will have two objects, one at index 1 with a red color and one at index 7 with a green color. You can create this output sequence by performing the steps outlined above.\nTest Output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]."
