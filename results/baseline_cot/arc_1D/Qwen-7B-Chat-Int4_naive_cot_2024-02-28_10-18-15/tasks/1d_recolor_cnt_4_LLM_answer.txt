prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

If an object has no consecutive occurrences, it will be removed.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to count the number of consecutive occurrences of each color and determine the positions and sizes of the objects accordingly. If an object has no consecutive occurrences, it should be removed. You can use the following steps to do this:

  1. Iterate over the input sequence one element at a time.
  2. Check if the current element is equal to the previous element.
  3. If they are equal, increment the counter for the corresponding color.
  4. If they are not equal, update the position and size of the corresponding object according to the counter and the number of consecutive occurrences.
  5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the input sequence is reached.
  6. Create a new output sequence by copying the elements from the input sequence without the objects that were removed in step 5.

Note that this is just one way to interpret the transformation pattern. There may be other ways to achieve the same result. You can experiment with different approaches and see what works best for this specific input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.
