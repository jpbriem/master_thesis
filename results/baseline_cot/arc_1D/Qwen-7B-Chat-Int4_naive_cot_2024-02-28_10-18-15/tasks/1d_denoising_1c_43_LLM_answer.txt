prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence contains 1 object of color 0 at index 1-2. The output sequence also has one object of color 0 at index 1-2, but it is hollowed out (filled with 0s).', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence contains two objects of color 6 at indices 1-2 and 3-4. The output sequence removes these objects and replaces them with two copies of the same object of color 0 at indices 1-2 and 3-4.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence contains three objects of color 6 at indices 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6. The output sequence removes these objects and replaces them with three copies of the same object of color 0 at indices 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the input sequence is transformed into an output sequence where each object is either removed or replaced with a copy of itself, depending on whether the object is hollow or filled with 0s. Additionally, the number of objects in the output sequence is always equal to the number of objects in the input sequence, even if some objects are removed. Furthermore, the positions of the objects in the output sequence match those of the objects in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and decide whether to remove or replace them with a copy of themselves. If the object is hollow, you should fill it with 0s. If the object is filled with 0s, you should remove it from the output sequence. After identifying the objects, you can create the resulting output sequence by replacing each object with its corresponding copy or filling it with 0s. Finally, you should check that the output sequence has the correct number of objects and their positions match those of the objects in the input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'In this input sequence, there are three objects of color 7 at indices 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6.
