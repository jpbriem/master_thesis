            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: In this example, there is an object with color 8 at index 5, and it is surrounded by other objects with color 6. It can be moved to the right two positions (index 7 and 8) and its size increases by one (from 5 to 6).\n  * Example_2: In this example, there is an object with color 8 at index 5, and it is surrounded by other objects with color 6. It can be moved to the left two positions (index 3 and 4), and its size decreases by one (from 6 to 5). Additionally, there is another object with color 8 at index 11, which can be copied and pasted after the original object, increasing its size from 5 to 6.\n  * Example_3: In this example, there is an object with color 8 at index 5, and it is surrounded by other objects with color 6. It can be moved to the right two positions (index 7 and 8), and its size increases by one (from 5 to 6). There is also another object with color 8 at index 11, which can be copied and pasted before the original object, decreasing its size from 6 to 5.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * The overall pattern involves moving objects around and copying them to change their size or position.\n  * Objects are identified by their color and their starting and ending indices.\n  * Objects can be scaled up or down by changing their size.\n  * Objects can be removed by deleting their starting and ending indices.\n  * Objects can be copied and pasted by adding or removing their size.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and determine where they should be placed in the output sequence.\n  * You can move objects by changing their starting and ending indices.\n  * You can copy objects by adding or removing their size.\n  * You can remove objects by deleting their starting and ending indices.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Object Description: There is an object with color 8 at index 5, and it is surrounded by other objects with color 6.\n  * Transformed Objects: Move object at index 5 to the right two positions (index 7 and 8) and increase its size from 5 to 6.\n  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output:\n\n  * [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
