prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
The transformation pattern in these examples involves copying a sequence of zeros followed by a single object (represented by a value of 2) and then filling the remaining positions with zeros. This can be achieved using a simple loop to iterate over each element in the input sequence and check if it is equal to zero. If it is, add a single object at that index, otherwise leave the element unchanged. Finally, replace any remaining zeros with another object (in this case, represented by a value of 0).
To transform the given test case, we can follow this approach:

  1. Initialize an empty output sequence.
  2. Iterate over each element in the input sequence.
  3. Check if the current element is equal to zero.
  4. If it is, add a single object at that index and set the next element to a zero.
  5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the end of the input sequence is reached.
  6. Replace any remaining zeros with another object (in this case, represented by a value of 0).

Using this approach, we get the following output sequence:

```
[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```


As for the overall pattern, the transformation involves iterating over each element in the input sequence and checking if it is equal to zero. If it is, it adds a single object at that index and replaces any remaining zeros with another object. The number of objects added depends on the length of the input sequence. In the case where there are no zeros in the input sequence, the output will be identical to the input sequence.

Instructions for transforming a new input into its output would involve performing the above steps on the input sequence. Start by initializing an empty output sequence and then iterate over each element in the input sequence. For each element, check if it is equal to zero. If it is, add a single object at that index and replace any remaining zeros with another object. Finally, return the resulting output sequence.

Transformed objects should be described as follows:

  * If an object is added to the output sequence, it should be specified as a dictionary containing information about its color, position, and size. For example, {"color": 2, "position": [3, 4], "size": [2, 2]} describes an object that is located at position [3, 4] and has a size of [2, 2].
  * If a zero is replaced with another object, the new object should also be described as a dictionary with the same properties as the original object. For example, {"color": 0, "position": [3, 4], "size": [2, 2]} describes a new object that is located at the same position as the previous object but has a different color and size.

Output should be returned as a numpy array with the same length as the input sequence. Any zeros in the output sequence should be replaced with the appropriate object described above.
