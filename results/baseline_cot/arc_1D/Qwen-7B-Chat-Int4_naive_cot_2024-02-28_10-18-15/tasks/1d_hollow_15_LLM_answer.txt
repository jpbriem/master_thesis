prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains 16 zeros and one seven. In the output sequence, the last six zeros are replaced with six sevens, making it an instance of the pattern where adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains two groups of four consecutive pixels of the same color (sevens), each group separated by a single pixel of another color (zero). The output sequence removes the second group of sevens, leaving only the first group. This demonstrates the pattern of removing objects.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains eight groups of three consecutive pixels of the same color (twos), each group separated by two pixels of another color (zeros). The output sequence combines these eight groups into a single object of size 8x3. This demonstrates the pattern of combining objects.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'All input-output pairs demonstrate the pattern of transforming adjacent pixels of the same color into objects, with some variations in the specific operations performed:', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:', 'transformation': { 'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!' }, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]' } }

# Transformation Instructions:

  1. Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!
  2. For each object in the input sequence, count the number of pixels of the same color that make up the object, determine their positions relative to each other, and note any special characteristics (such as gaps or overlaps).
  3. Based on the information you gathered about the objects in the input sequence, create the corresponding objects in the output sequence. You may need to modify the size or position of the objects, or add additional objects if necessary. Be sure to maintain the correct number of pixels for each object and ensure that there are no gaps or overlaps between them.
  4. Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!

# Test Output Sequence:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Note: The specific instructions provided here assume that the objects in the input sequence are represented by consecutive pixels of the same color. If the objects in the input sequence are represented differently (e.g., by clusters of pixels rather than individual pixels), the transformation process will need to be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, the instructions provide a general outline of the transformation process, but more detailed guidance may be required depending on the specifics of the problem being solved.
