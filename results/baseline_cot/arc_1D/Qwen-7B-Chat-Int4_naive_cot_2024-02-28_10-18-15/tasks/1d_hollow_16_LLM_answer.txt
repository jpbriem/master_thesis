prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": {
    "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has no noise pixels and contains two objects. The first object consists of six pixels, starting at index 1 and ending at index 6. The second object consists of one pixel, starting at index 10 and ending at index 10. After applying the transformation, the output sequence has no noise pixels and also contains two objects. However, the positions and sizes of the objects have been modified. The first object now starts at index 1 and ends at index 5, and it has become smaller (now consisting of five instead of six pixels). The second object remains unchanged."
    },
    "example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence has no noise pixels and contains two objects. The first object consists of seven pixels, starting at index 1 and ending at index 7. The second object consists of zero pixels, starting at index 8 and ending at index 8. After applying the transformation, the output sequence has no noise pixels and also contains two objects. However, the positions and sizes of the objects have been modified. The first object now starts at index 1 and ends at index 6, and it has become smaller (now consisting of six instead of seven pixels). The second object has disappeared.",
    "example_3": "In Example_3, the input sequence has no noise pixels and contains two objects. The first object consists of eight pixels, starting at index 1 and ending at index 8. The second object consists of zero pixels, starting at index 9 and ending at index 9. After applying the transformation, the output sequence has no noise pixels and also contains two objects. However, the positions and sizes of the objects have been modified. The first object now starts at index 1 and ends at index 7, and it has become smaller (now consisting of seven instead of eight pixels). The second object has disappeared."
},
"pattern": "In each input-output pair, there are two objects. One object consists of a fixed number of pixels, while the other object consists of either zero or more pixels. After applying the transformation, the positions and sizes of the objects may change. In some cases, an object may disappear altogether. No noise pixels are present in any of the input-output pairs."
"instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:

  1. Identify the two objects in the input sequence. The first object will consist of a fixed number of pixels, while the second object will consist of either zero or more pixels.
  2. Determine the new positions and sizes of the objects after applying the transformation. This can be done using various techniques, such as moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc.
  3. Create the resulting output sequence by replacing the original objects in the input sequence with their new counterparts.

Note that the specific details of the transformation may vary depending on the input-output pairs provided and the desired outcome."
