prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has 10 pixels, while the output sequence also has 10 pixels. The objects in the input sequence are [Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 5, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}]. In the output sequence, the object [Object_1] has been moved one position to the right, so it starts at index 2 instead of index 1. The object [Object_2] has remained unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has 10 pixels, while the output sequence also has 10 pixels. The objects in the input sequence are [Object_1: {color: 0, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 6, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}]. In the output sequence, the object [Object_1] has been copied and then removed, so there is no object at index 1 anymore. The object [Object_2] has remained unchanged.', 'Overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern in these input-output pairs is that each object can be transformed using various actions, such as moving, copying, removing, and recoloring. These actions may involve changing the size, position, or color of an object, or even deleting an object entirely. The input and output sequences both have the same number of pixels, but the objects and their relationships between them may change.' }, 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. Each object is represented by a dictionary containing information about its color, size, and position.
  2. Determine the desired transformation for each object. This could involve moving the object, copying it, removing it, recoloring it, or any combination of these actions.
  3. Apply the chosen transformations to the objects in the input sequence. Make sure to update the size, position, and color of each object accordingly.
  4. Create the output sequence by combining the transformed objects together. You can use any method you prefer to arrange the objects in the output sequence, as long as they maintain their correct positions and sizes.

For example, if the input sequence contains two objects, one at position (1, 1) with color 0 and another at position (4, 4) with color 1, and we want to move the second object to position (2, 2), the output sequence would contain two objects as well, one at position (1, 1) with color 0 and another at position (2, 2) with color 1. Note that the second object's position has been shifted by one position to the left, and its size remains unchanged.

Be careful to include all the pixels in the sequence.', 'object_description': 'To describe the objects in the input sequence, focus on their color, size, and position. If an object is missing, indicate that it should remain unchanged in the output sequence.', 'transformed_objects': 'To describe how the objects should look like in the output sequence, focus on their color, size, and position. If an object is missing, indicate that it should remain unchanged in the output sequence. If an object has undergone a transformation, provide details about what action was performed and where the object ended up after the transformation.', 'output': 'Create the resulting output sequence by combining the transformed objects together.

def transformation(input):
    # Identify objects in the input sequence
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(input)):
        if input[i] != 0:
            objects.append({'color': input[i], 'start_index': i, 'end_index': i})

    transformed_objects = []
    for obj in objects:
        if obj['color'] == 0:
            # Remove object
            pass
        elif obj['color'] == 1:
            # Recolor object
            pass
        else:
            # Move object
            pass
    
    # Transform objects in the input sequence
    transformed_input = []
    for i in range(len(input)):
        if input[i] != 0:
            transformed_input.append(input[i])
    
    return transformed_input

# Test the function
print(transformation([0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))

Note: This is just an example implementation, and the actual transformation patterns and instructions will depend on the specific requirements of the task.
