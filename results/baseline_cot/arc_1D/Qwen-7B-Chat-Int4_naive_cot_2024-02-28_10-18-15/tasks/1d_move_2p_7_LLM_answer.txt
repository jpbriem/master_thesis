prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has three identical objects, each of which is located at index 1, 2, and 3. The object at index 1 has color 3, while the other two objects have color 0. The output sequence has the same objects but with different colors. Specifically, the object at index 1 now has color 0, while the other two objects still have color 3.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has two identical objects, each of which is located at index 1 and 2. The object at index 1 has color 2, while the other object has color 0. The output sequence has the same objects but with different colors. Specifically, the object at index 1 now has color 0, while the other object still has color 2.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has three identical objects, each of which is located at index 1, 2, and 3. The object at index 1 has color 3, while the other two objects have color 0. The output sequence has the same objects but with different colors. Specifically, the object at index 1 now has color 0, while the other two objects still have color 3.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For this transformation pattern, there are three objects in the input sequence. Each object consists of one pixel, which can either be a background pixel (value 0) or an object pixel (value 1-9). The objects are arranged in a specific order, with the first object starting at index 1 and ending at index 3, the second object starting at index 4 and ending at index 5, and the third object starting at index 6 and ending at index 7. The transformation rule involves changing the color of the pixels in the objects. Specifically, if the original color of an object pixel is x, then the new color of the pixel will be y, where y is determined based on the value of the corresponding object description field in the test cases. If the object description field does not specify a new color, then the pixel will remain unchanged and retain its original color.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence using this transformation pattern, you need to follow these steps:

  * Identify the number of objects in the input sequence.
  * Determine the starting and ending indices of each object in the input sequence.
  * Check the object description field in the test cases to determine the new color of each object pixel.
  * Apply the new color to each object pixel in the input sequence according to the specified rules.

Here is an example of how to apply this transformation pattern to the test case:

  * There are three objects in the input sequence.
  * The first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 3.
  * The second object starts at index 4 and ends at index 5.
  * The third object starts at index 6 and ends at index 7.
  * The object description field specifies that the color of the pixels in the first object should be changed from 3 to 0, the color of the pixels in the second object should be changed from 2 to 0, and the color of the pixels in the third object should remain unchanged.

Based on this information, we can create the following output sequence:

  * [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]
  * [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  * [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Note that the output sequence has the same objects as the input sequence, but with different colors according to the specified rules. To obtain the output sequence, you can simply replace each object pixel in the input sequence with the corresponding object pixel in the output sequence, based on the new color specified in the object description field.', 'transformation': {'input': '[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence. The first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 3. The second object starts at index 4 and ends at index 5. The third object starts at index 6 and ends at index 7. The object description field specifies that the color of the pixels in the first object should be changed from 3 to 0, the color of the pixels in the second object should be changed from 2 to 0, and the color of the pixels in the third object should remain unchanged.', 'transformed_objects': 'The first object becomes [0, 0, 0], the second object becomes [0, 0, 2], and the third object remains unchanged. ', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]'}

In summary, the input sequence [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0].
