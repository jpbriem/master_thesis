            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe transformation pattern shared among these examples can be inferred as follows:\n\n  * There exists a fixed number of objects in each input sequence, represented by numbers from 1 to n.\n  * Each object has a fixed size, represented by an integer k.\n  * The positions of the objects relative to one another are defined by their distances (i.e., the absolute difference between two consecutive object indices).\n  * The colors of the objects are represented by integers from 1 to m.\n\nGiven this information, we can define the overall pattern as follows:\n\n  * Transform the input sequence by counting the number of occurrences of each object color and the total number of objects.\n  * Create a new sequence where each object color corresponds to the corresponding count.\n  * If there are any remaining unassigned counts, assign them to the background color.\n  * Sort the resulting sequence according to the order of the original object colors.\n\nTo transform the given test case, we can follow these steps:\n\n  1. Count the number of occurrences of each object color and the total number of objects:\n    * The test case contains 6 objects with colors 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, and 2.\n    * There are 6 distinct object colors.\n    * The total number of objects is 6.\n  2. Create a new sequence where each object color corresponds to the corresponding count:\n    * We can create a new sequence with 6 elements, where each element represents the count of the corresponding object color.\n    * The sequence will look like this: [5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n  3. Assign the remaining unassigned counts to the background color:\n    * Since there are no more unassigned counts, we do not need to perform this step.\n  4. Sort the resulting sequence according to the order of the original object colors:\n    * We can sort the sequence using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, passing it the original object colors as keys.\n\nTherefore, the resulting test output sequence would be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]."
