            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, there are two objects. Object 1 has a size of 2x2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 2. Object 2 has a size of 2x2, starting at index 4 and ending at index 4.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, there is one object.

Object 2 has a size of 2x2, starting at index 4 and ending at index 4. Object 3 has a size of 2x2, starting at index 8 and ending at index 11.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'In each example, the input sequence contains objects. Each object is represented by a range of indices in the input sequence. The objects can overlap and may contain other objects.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. An object is a range of consecutive indices in the input sequence.\n  2. Determine the size of each object.\n  3. Move each object to a new location in the output sequence. If two objects overlap, they cannot be placed simultaneously in the output sequence. Instead, they must be separated by a non-overlapping region of the output sequence.\n  4. Repeat step 3 until all objects have been placed in the output sequence.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, we would identify two objects: [1, 2] and [4, 5]. We would then determine their sizes: 2x2 and 2x2 respectively. Next, we would move each object to a new location in the output sequence. Since the objects do not overlap, we could place them side-by-side without any issues. Finally, we would repeat this process until all objects have been placed in the output sequence.\nOnce you have identified the objects in the input sequence and determined their sizes, you can create the corresponding objects in the output sequence using the provided transformation instructions. In this case, since the input sequence contains no noise pixels, we simply need to place the objects in the output sequence without modifying them in any way. Therefore, the output sequence would be identical to the input sequence.\nOverall, the transformation pattern involves identifying objects in the input sequence, determining their sizes, moving them to a new location in the output sequence, and repeating this process until all objects have been placed in the output sequence. The specific details of the transformation will depend on the characteristics of the input and output sequences, including the presence of overlapping objects, noise pixels, and other constraints."
