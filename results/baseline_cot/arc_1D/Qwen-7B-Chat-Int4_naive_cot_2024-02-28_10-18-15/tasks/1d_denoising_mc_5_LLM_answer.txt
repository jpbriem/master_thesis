prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 7, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'The input sequence contains many instances of the color 2. The output sequence has no instances of this color. Therefore, the transformation removed all instances of color 2.', 'Example_2': 'The input sequence contains one instance of the color 4. The output sequence also contains one instance of this color. Therefore, the transformation copied the instance of color 4 from the input sequence to the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'The input sequence contains two objects, one of which has the color 1 and another of which has the color 7. The output sequence also contains two objects, both of which have the color 2. Therefore, the transformation recolored all objects in the input sequence to the color 2.', 'Overall_pattern': 'In general, the transformation takes an input sequence and produces an output sequence where each object is either copied from the input sequence (if it exists), removed (if it does not exist in the input sequence), recolored (if its color differs from the majority of colors in the input sequence), or scaled down (if its size is larger than the average size of objects in the input sequence).', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify each object in the input sequence and decide whether to copy it, remove it, recolor it, or scale it down. You can then apply these operations to create the output sequence. For example, if there is an object in the input sequence with the color 4 but no similar object in the output sequence, you would remove it from the input sequence and add it to the output sequence. If there is an object in the input sequence with the color 1 but all other objects have the color 2, you would recolor it to the color 2. If there is an object in the input sequence that is significantly larger than the average size of objects in the input sequence, you would scale it down to the average size.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regard the test input sequence as a set of objects. Each object consists of a color and a bounding box indicating its location in the image. Focus on the number of objects, their positions, sizes, and colors.', 'transformed_objects': 'Create the output sequence by applying the transformation rules to the objects in the input sequence. This involves copying objects from the input sequence to the output sequence, removing objects from the input sequence, recoloring objects in the input sequence, and scaling objects down to the average size.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence.
