prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence consists of nine identical 0s and three identical 3s. The output sequence also has nine identical 0s and three identical 3s, but they are arranged differently. In this example, there is no change in the number or type of objects present in the input or output sequences. However, the positions of the objects have been rearranged.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence consists of nine identical 6s and six identical 0s. The output sequence also has nine identical 6s and six identical 0s, but they are arranged differently. In this example, there is no change in the number or type of objects present in the input or output sequences. However, the positions of the objects have been rearranged.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence consists of nine identical 0s and one identical 1. The output sequence also has nine identical 0s and one identical 1, but they are arranged differently. In this example, there is no change in the number or type of objects present in the input or output sequences. However, the positions of the objects have been rearranged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All three examples demonstrate a simple transformation where the input sequence is rearranged to create the output sequence. Specifically, each example involves moving objects around without changing their size or color. This can be achieved using the "move" operation in our transformation model.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, you will need to move objects around until they are arranged in the desired order. You can do this by identifying the starting position of each object and then moving it to a new location. Keep track of the size and color of each object as you move them so that you can recreate the output sequence correctly.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'For the given input sequence, identify the objects present. Each object consists of a color (represented by a value from 1 to 9) and a position represented by a pair of indices (e.g., (1, 1)) indicating the starting position of the object. The size of the object is determined by the number of consecutive 0s in the input sequence before the object begins. Note that the objects may overlap or contain other objects.', 'transformed_objects': 'Create the transformed output sequence by rearranging the objects in the input sequence. To do this, move each object to a new location while preserving its color and size. If two objects overlap, merge them together by combining their colors and sizes. Repeat this process until the output sequence is complete. Be sure to maintain the correct position and size of each object in the output sequence.', 'output': 'Once you have created the transformed output sequence, copy it to the output field provided in the task. Remember to mind the sequence length and ensure that the output sequence accurately reflects the desired arrangement of objects.'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]'}
