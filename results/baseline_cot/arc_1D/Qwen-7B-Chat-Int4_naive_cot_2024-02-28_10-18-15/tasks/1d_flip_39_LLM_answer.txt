prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": {"Example_1": "In Example_1, we see that there is one object (a group of six consecutive 8s) in the input sequence. In the output sequence, this object has been moved one space to the right.", "Example_2": "In Example_2, we see two objects in the input sequence - an object consisting of six 7s and another object consisting of seven 7s. In the output sequence, both objects have remained unchanged." }, "overall_pattern": "Both examples demonstrate that objects can remain unchanged or move in the output sequence according to some unknown rule.", "instructions": "To transform the input sequence into its output sequence, you need to determine what rule governs the movement of objects in the output sequence. Once you have identified this rule, you can apply it to the input sequence to obtain the desired output sequence.", "transformation": {"input": "Copy the input sequence from the task.", "object_description": "Identify the objects in the input sequence. Each object consists of a contiguous block of identical pixels.", "transformed_objects": "Move each object according to the rule governing the movement of objects in the output sequence. If no specific rule is given, make a reasonable assumption about the movement of objects based on the examples provided.", "output": "Create the output sequence by applying the appropriate moves to the objects in the input sequence." }, "test_output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]" }
