            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 5, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\nIn this problem, we are given a set of input sequences of pixels, where each pixel has a value from 1 to 9 representing a different color. The goal is to transform these input sequences into their corresponding output sequences by applying certain operations on the pixels. We need to apply operations such as moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc., to the objects present in the input sequences. Additionally, we also need to consider noise pixels and arithmetical operations based on the objects. We can also make use of conditions while performing the transformations.\nOverall Pattern:\nThe overall pattern followed in this problem is to take an input sequence of pixels, perform certain operations on it, and get an output sequence of pixels. The operations performed on the input sequence depend on the type of objects present in the input sequence. Some common operations include moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc. We can also use conditions while performing the transformations. In addition to these operations, we also need to consider noise pixels and arithmetical operations based on the objects. Finally, we need to ensure that the output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence.\nInstructions:\n\n  * To create the output sequence, you need to follow the following steps:\n    1. Identify the objects present in the input sequence.\n    2. Perform the required operations on the objects.\n    3. Remove any noise pixels.\n    4. Apply arithmetical operations based on the objects.\n    5. Ensure that the output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence.\n  * You may use the provided examples to understand the transformation process better.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input Sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Object Description: There are no objects present in the input sequence.\n  * Transformed Objects: No objects need to be transformed.\n  * Output Sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
