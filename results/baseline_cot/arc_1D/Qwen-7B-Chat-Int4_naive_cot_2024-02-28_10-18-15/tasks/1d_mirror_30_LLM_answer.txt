prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": {"Example_1": "In Example 1, we see two objects of size 4x4 each. The first object is at (1,1) and the second object is at (6,6).", "Example_2": "In Example 2, we again see two objects of size 7x7 each. However, this time the first object is shifted horizontally and vertically compared to the previous one.", "Example_3": "In Example 3, we see three objects of size 2x2 each. The first two objects are aligned horizontally and vertically, while the third object is placed at the center." }, "overall_pattern": "All examples follow the same transformation pattern where objects can be moved, scaled, copied, recolored, removed, etc. Additionally, there may be noise pixels introduced in the input and output sequences.", "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation actions to them. This could involve moving, scaling, copying, recoloring, removing, etc. You also need to pay attention to the noise pixels in the input and output sequences. Finally, make sure that the output sequence has the correct length." , "transformation": {"input": "[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]", "object_description": "There are two objects present in the input sequence. Object 1 is located at (1,1) and has dimensions 7x7. Object 2 is located at (6,6) and has dimensions 7x7.", "transformed_objects": "For Object 1, you could move it to the top-left corner of the output sequence by shifting it up and left by 5 positions. For Object 2, you could shift it down and right by 3 positions. After these movements, the transformed objects would be located at (1,1) and (3,3), respectively. As for Object 3, since it is a noise pixel, no action needs to be taken.", "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]" }, "test_output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]" }
