            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: The input sequence contains 15 objects, where each object has 2 pixels. The output sequence also contains 15 objects, but their positions and sizes are different compared to the input sequence. In particular, two objects were removed, one was moved, another was resized, and some were copied.\n  * Example_2: The input sequence contains 15 objects, where each object has 2 pixels. The output sequence also contains 15 objects, but their positions and sizes are different compared to the input sequence. In this case, no objects were removed, modified, or copied.\n  * Example_3: The input sequence contains 15 objects, where each object has 2 pixels. The output sequence also contains 15 objects, but their positions and sizes are different compared to the input sequence. In this case, two objects were removed, one was moved, another was resized, and some were copied.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * The overall pattern is that there is a mapping function that takes an input sequence and produces an output sequence. This mapping function can involve removing, modifying, copying, or creating new objects in the output sequence.\n  * The specific details of the mapping function depend on the input and output sequences. In general, the mapping function will try to preserve the relative order and structure of the objects in the input sequence while making changes to their positions, sizes, or colors.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform a new input into its output, you need to follow these steps:\n    * Identify the objects in the input sequence using the provided object description.\n    * Use the provided instructions to determine how to modify the objects in the output sequence based on the corresponding input objects.\n    * Create the resulting output sequence by applying the modifications to the input sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Object Description: There are 15 objects in the input sequence, each with 2 pixels. The objects are numbered starting at index 1.\n  * Transformed Objects: Remove object 1 (with index 1), move object 2 (with index 2) to position 14, resize object 4 (with index 4) to size 1x1, copy object 10 (with index 10) twice, create new object 15 with size 1x1 and color 8.\n  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 2"
