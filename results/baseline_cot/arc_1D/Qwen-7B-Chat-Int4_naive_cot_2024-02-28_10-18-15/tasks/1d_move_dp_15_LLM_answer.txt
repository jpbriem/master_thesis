prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": { "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has 6 objects (one object per digit), each with a size of 2 pixels. In the output sequence, one object was removed from the middle of the sequence. Specifically, the object at index 4 was removed, leaving 5 objects. Additionally, the object at index 2 had its size increased from 2 pixels to 3 pixels.", "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence has 7 objects (one object per digit), each with a size of 8 pixels. In the output sequence, one object was moved to the right end of the sequence. Specifically, the object at index 6 was moved to index 7, leaving 6 objects. Additionally, the object at index 2 had its size decreased from 8 pixels to 7 pixels." }, "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern observed in these examples is that the input sequence consists of a series of objects, where each object is represented by a single value in the sequence. Each object has a specific size and position within the sequence. The output sequence contains the same number of objects as the input sequence, but their positions and sizes may differ. Specifically, some objects may be removed, modified, or added to the output sequence. Additionally, there may be changes in the relative positions of the objects within the sequence. Overall, the transformation pattern involves manipulating the individual objects within the input sequence to create the desired output sequence." }, "instructions": "To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and modify them according to the transformation pattern. This typically involves removing, adding, moving, or modifying objects within the sequence. To determine the correct modifications, you can focus on the relative positions and sizes of the objects within the sequence, as well as any conditions or constraints that may apply. Once you have identified the necessary modifications, you can apply them to the input sequence to generate the corresponding output sequence." }, "transformation": {"input": "[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]", "object_description": "The input sequence consists of 7 objects, each represented by a single value in the sequence. The objects have a size of 4 pixels and are located at indices 0 through 6. There is no noise in the input sequence.", "transformed_objects": "To transform the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence, we need to identify the necessary modifications to the objects within the sequence. Specifically, we need to remove one object from the middle of the sequence and modify the object at index 2 so that it has a size of 3 pixels instead of 4 pixels. Here's how we can do this:

  * Remove the object at index 4: We can simply delete the value at index 4 from the input sequence to achieve this. The updated sequence would then be [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0].
  * Modify the object at index 2: We can increase the size of the object at index 2 by setting its value to 3 instead of 4. This will change the size of the object from 4 pixels to 3 pixels. The updated sequence would then be [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0].

By applying these modifications, we have successfully transformed the input sequence into the corresponding output sequence." }, "test_output": "[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0]" }
