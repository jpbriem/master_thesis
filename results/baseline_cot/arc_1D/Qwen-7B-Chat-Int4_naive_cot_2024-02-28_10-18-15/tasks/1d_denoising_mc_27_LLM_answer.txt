prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 2, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description of Example_1:

In this example, the input sequence consists of 25 consecutive zeros followed by 25 consecutive ones. The output sequence also has 25 consecutive zeros followed by 25 consecutive ones. However, there is one significant difference between the two sequences: the objects in the output sequence are arranged differently than in the input sequence. In the input sequence, the objects are scattered randomly throughout the sequence, while in the output sequence, they are aligned horizontally at the center of the sequence. This indicates that the transformation involved some kind of reordering or arrangement of the objects.

Overall Pattern:

Based on the three given examples, it seems that the transformation involves rearranging the objects in the input sequence so that they align horizontally at the center of the sequence. The exact details of the transformation may vary depending on the specific input sequence, but the general pattern appears to involve moving objects around until they are properly aligned.

Instructions:

To transform a new input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify any objects in the input sequence by looking for groups of consecutive pixels with the same value (except for the background color).
2. Determine the positions of each object relative to the center of the sequence.
3. Rearrange the objects so that they align horizontally at the center of the sequence.

For example, let's consider the following input sequence:

```css
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This input sequence contains no objects. To create an output sequence that aligns the objects horizontally at the center of the sequence, we could do the following:

```css
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

In this output sequence, the pixels are arranged horizontally at the center of the sequence, with no objects present.

Transformation:

Here is the input sequence you need to transform:

```css
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```

First, identify the objects in the input sequence:

```python
objects = []
for i in range(len(input)):
    if input[i] == 0:
        continue
    else:
        objects.append((i, input[i]))
```

Next, determine the positions of each object relative to the center of the sequence:

```makefile
center = len(input) // 2
positions = [(x - center) % len(input), x - center] for x, _ in objects
```

Finally, arrange the objects so that they align horizontally at the center of the sequence:

```scss
output = [input[0]]
for pos in positions:
    output += [input[pos[0]]] + [input[pos[1] + 1]]
output += [input[-1]]
print(output)
```

This will give you the output sequence that aligns the objects horizontally at the center of the sequence:

```sql
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```
