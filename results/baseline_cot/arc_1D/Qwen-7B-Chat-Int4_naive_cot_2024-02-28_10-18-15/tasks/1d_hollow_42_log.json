            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has 10 identical elements at index 0. In the output sequence, the first element at index 0 is replaced by an object with the same color but a smaller size.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence has 10 identical elements at index 4. In the output sequence, the first element at index 4 is replaced by an object with the same color but a larger size.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence has 10 identical elements at index 5. In the output sequence, the first element at index 5 is replaced by an object with a different color.', 'Overall_pattern': 'All input-output pairs follow the same pattern: one or more objects are inserted into the sequence, replacing some or all of the original objects. Each object is either the same color as one of the original objects or a different color. The number of objects inserted can vary depending on the specific transformation rule applied.'}, 'instructions': 'To transform the given input into its corresponding output, you need to perform the following steps:\n\n  * Identify any existing objects in the input sequence. These are represented by a dictionary containing information about their color, position, and size.\n  * Determine what kind of transformation needs to be performed on the input sequence. This could involve adding, removing, scaling, rotating, or otherwise modifying existing objects, or creating entirely new objects.\n  * Apply the chosen transformation to the input sequence, using the identified objects as necessary. If new objects are added, make sure they do not overlap with existing objects.\n  * Check if the resulting sequence satisfies the requirements of the transformation pattern. Specifically, ensure that each object has the correct color, position, and size, and that no two objects overlap.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, the resulting sequence will be the desired output.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': {'Original_objects': [{'color': 0, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}]}}, 'output': '[0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'test_output': np.array([0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}, 'test_output': np.array([0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])}\nNote: Please replace the placeholder value in the `transformation` field with the actual input sequence provided in the question."
