prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern: In this task, there seems to be a pattern where each object has a fixed color and size, and can be moved horizontally or vertically to a new location. There may also be some noise pixels in the input sequence, but they do not seem to affect the output sequence. Additionally, there may be some arithmetical operations involved, such as counting the number of objects in the input sequence.
Instructions: To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we need to identify the objects in the input sequence and then move them to their desired locations while preserving their original color and size. We can use the concept of moving objects horizontally or vertically to achieve this. If there are any noise pixels in the input sequence, we can ignore them during the transformation process. Finally, we can perform some arithmetical operations on the transformed objects, such as counting the total number of objects, if required.
Transformation: Input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Transformed Objects: [Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 2, end_index: 3, size: 1}, Object_2: {color: 5, start_index: 5, end_index: 5, size: 1}]
Test Output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
