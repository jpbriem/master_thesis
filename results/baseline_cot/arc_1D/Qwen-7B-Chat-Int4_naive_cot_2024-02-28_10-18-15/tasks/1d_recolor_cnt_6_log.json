            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: In this example, we can see that there are two groups of four identical pixels (objects) located at the beginning and the end of the sequence. After applying the transformation, one group has been moved one position towards the right while the other remains unchanged.\n  * Example_2: This example shows another instance of two groups of four identical pixels, but this time they are separated by an additional object at index 8. Applying the transformation moves both groups of four pixels one position towards the right, and the extra object is removed.\n  * Example_3: In this example, there are three groups of four identical pixels, each separated by two blank pixels. Applying the transformation removes the blank pixels and moves the groups of four pixels closer together.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * Input consists of a sequence of pixels where each pixel takes value 0 or 1, representing either the background color (0) or a specific object color (1).\n  * Output consists of the same sequence of pixels, but with some modifications applied to the objects. These modifications include moving, removing, copying, or recoloring objects.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the necessary transformations to them.\n  * Move objects by changing their positions relative to each other. Remove objects by deleting them from the sequence entirely. Copy objects by creating duplicates of them in the sequence. Recolor objects by changing their color values.\n  * Apply these transformations in order to create the final output sequence.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4]\n  * Description: There are two groups of four identical pixels at the beginning and the end of the sequence.\n  * Object description: One group is located at indices 0 to 3 and another group is located at indices 7 to 10.\n  * Transformed objects: After applying the transformation, the group at indices 0 to 3 is moved one position towards the right while the group at indices 7 to 10 remains unchanged.\n  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output:\n\n  * Numpy array format: [[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 5, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]]"
