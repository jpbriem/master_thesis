            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe given input-output pairs follow a common pattern where each object in the input sequence is replaced by an identical object in the output sequence. In other words, the transformation is one-to-one mapping of objects.\nFor Example 1, the input sequence has two objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}] and [Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}]. The output sequence also has two objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}] and [Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}]. Therefore, the transformation is simply copying the objects from the input to the output without any changes.\nFor Example 2, the input sequence has three objects: [Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}] and [Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}] and [Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}]. The output sequence also has three objects: [Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}] and [Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}] and [Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}]. Therefore, the transformation is again just copying the objects from the input to the output without any changes.\nFor Example 3, the input sequence has four objects: [Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}] and [Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}] and [Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}] and [Object_4: {color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}]. The output sequence also has four objects: [Object_1: {color: 8, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}] and [Object_2: {color: 0, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}] and [Object_3: {color: 0, start_index: 6, end_index: 6, size: 1}] and [Object_4: {color: 0, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}]. Therefore, the transformation is again just copying the objects from the input to the output without any changes.\nOverall, the transformation pattern can be summarized as:\n\n  * Each object in the input sequence is mapped to an identical object in the output sequence.\n  * The size and position of the objects remain unchanged.\n  * The color of the objects may change (if there are multiple instances of the same color in the input sequence).\n\nInstructions for transforming a new input into its output:\n\n  * Identify the number of objects in the input sequence.\n  * Create an empty list to store the transformed objects.\n  * Iterate through each object in the input sequence.\n  * For each object, find its corresponding object in the output sequence.\n  * Copy the properties of the corresponding object in the output sequence to the current object in the input sequence.\n  * Append the transformed object to the list of transformed objects.\n  * Return the list of transformed objects as the output.\n\nTransformation action for a new input sequence:\n\n  * Follow the above instructions to identify and transform each object in the input sequence.\n\nTest Output:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]"
