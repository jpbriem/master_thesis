prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, there are two objects, one of them is an object of color 3 (represented by [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) and the other is an object of color 0 (represented by [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). The objects are arranged in a specific order, where the object of color 3 comes first and then the object of color 0. In the output sequence, the objects are still arranged in this specific order, but they are hollowed out. The size of both objects remains the same, but their positions change slightly.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, there is one object of color 5 (represented by [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]) and no other objects. The object of color 5 is arranged at the center of the output sequence. The size of the object remains the same, but its position changes slightly.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, there is one object of color 1 (represented by [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) and no other objects. The object of color 1 is arranged at the center of the output sequence. The size of the object remains the same, but its position changes slightly.'}, 'Overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern shared among these three examples is that each input sequence contains multiple objects of the same color, arranged in a specific order. Each object has a specific color and position, and can either remain unchanged or undergo some transformation. In the output sequences, the objects may be hollowed out, moved, resized, or colored differently. However, the overall structure and arrangement of the objects remain the same, and the number and type of objects do not change.'}, 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation to each object. You can hollow out objects by removing their interior pixels, move objects by changing their position, resize objects by changing their size, and recolor objects by changing their color. You can also count the number of objects in the input sequence and sort them based on their color or position. If the input sequence contains noise pixels, you can filter them out using appropriate techniques. Once you have identified the necessary transformations and applied them to the input sequence, you will get the output sequence. Remember to follow the conditions mentioned in the problem statement while performing the transformation.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the test case:', 'object_description': 'Explain the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'Create the resulting output sequence by applying the appropriate transformations to the input sequence. Mind the sequence length!', }, 'test_output': 'A numpy array containing the transformed input sequence.'}
