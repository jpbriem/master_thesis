prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has 16 zeros followed by 8 ones. The output sequence has 16 zeros followed by 8 zeros instead of ones.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has 16 fours followed by 8 zeros. The output sequence has 16 zeros followed by 8 fours instead of zeros.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has 16 zeros followed by 8 fives. The output sequence has 16 zeros followed by 8 fives instead of zeros.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'The input-output pattern involves transforming each object in the input sequence by replacing it with an object of the opposite color, while maintaining the overall structure of the sequence. Specifically, if there are n zeros in the input sequence followed by m ones (or vice versa), then the output sequence will have n zeros followed by m zeros (or vice versa).', 'instructions': 'To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you can follow these steps:

  * Identify all the objects in the input sequence.
  * Determine their sizes, positions, and colors.
  * Replace each object with an object of the opposite color, keeping track of any changes made to the original objects.
  * Ensure that the overall structure of the sequence remains unchanged, i.e., the number of zeros and ones before and after each object remains constant.

For instance, in Example_1, we replace the first eight ones with eight zeros, effectively creating a new object of the opposite color. Similarly, in Example_2 and Example_3, we replace the first eight objects with their opposites, preserving the overall structure of the sequence.

Note that this transformation pattern does not involve noise pixels or arithmetical operations based on objects. It solely focuses on the replacement of objects with their opposites. If you encounter any difficulties in understanding or implementing this pattern, please consult the provided examples or seek additional clarification.' , 'transformation': { 'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Be sure to maintain the correct order of the objects and update their positions accordingly.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence by applying the above transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the output sequence would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], where each element corresponds to the position of the corresponding object in the input sequence.
