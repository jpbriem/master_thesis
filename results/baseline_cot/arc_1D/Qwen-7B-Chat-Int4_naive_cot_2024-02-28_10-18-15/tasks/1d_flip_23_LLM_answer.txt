prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has 25 zeros and 1 object. The object is located at index 8 and it consists of 5 consecutive pixels with value 7. In the output sequence, there are also 25 zeros but the object is now located at index 13 and consists of 4 consecutive pixels with value 7.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has 25 zeros and 1 object. The object is located at index 1 and it consists of 7 consecutive pixels with value 7. In the output sequence, there are still 25 zeros but the object is now located at index 8 and consists of 6 consecutive pixels with value 7.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence has 25 zeros and 1 object. The object is located at index 1 and it consists of 4 consecutive pixels with value 4. In the output sequence, there are still 25 zeros but the object is now located at index 10 and consists of 6 consecutive pixels with value 6.'}, 'Overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that each input sequence contains 25 zeros and one object. The object can consist of any number of consecutive pixels with the same value, starting at any index. After applying the transformation, the object is moved to a new location, but always stays within the bounds of the original sequence. The size of the object remains unchanged.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, you need to identify the object in the input sequence and move it to a new location without changing its size or shape. You can do this by finding the indices where the object starts and ends, then moving it to a new location using these indices. Make sure that the object stays within the bounds of the original sequence after being moved.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'The object is located at index 8 and consists of 5 consecutive pixels with value 7.', 'transformed_objects': 'After transformation, the object is located at index 13 and consists of 4 consecutive pixels with value 7.', 'output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'}
```css
# Transform the input sequence

# Identify the object in the input sequence
indices = np.where(input == 7)

# Move the object to a new location
new_indices = np.array([i + 2 for i in indices[0]])

# Create the output sequence
output = np.copy(input)
output[new_indices] = 7

# Check if the object is correctly moved
print(np.all(output == expected_output))
```

Note that this solution assumes that the object is always surrounded by zeros. If the object is not surrounded by zeros, additional steps may be required to ensure that it stays within the bounds of the original sequence.
