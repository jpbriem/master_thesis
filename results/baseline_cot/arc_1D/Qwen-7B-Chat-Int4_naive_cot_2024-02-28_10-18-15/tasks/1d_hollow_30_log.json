            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has 18 objects of color 0, arranged in a grid pattern.

The specific operations applied depend on the characteristics of the input and output sequences. The goal is to create a sequence that reflects the intended transformation while preserving the overall structure of the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n\n  * Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n  * Determine what operation(s) to apply to the objects.\n  * Apply the selected operation(s) to the objects, taking care to preserve their relative positions and sizes.\n  * Combine the modified objects to form the final output sequence.\n\nFor example, if the input sequence contains several small objects of color 2 arranged in a line, you could choose to hollow out the objects to create a single large object of color 0. Alternatively, if the input sequence contains several large objects of color 7 arranged in a grid pattern, you could choose to recolor the objects to color 0. It is important to note that the specific transformation will depend on the characteristics of the input and output sequences, so it may require some experimentation to find the correct solution.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Each object consists of a group of 5 consecutive pixels of color 0. To identify the objects, you can count the number of groups of 5 consecutive pixels of color 0 and divide by 5 to get the total number of objects. You can also visualize the input sequence using a plotting library such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to see the arrangement of the objects.', 'transformed_objects': 'To hollow out the objects, you can iterate over each group of 5 consecutive pixels of color 0 and set the value of those pixels to 0. This will effectively remove the object from the output sequence. Note that you need to take care when setting the value of pixels to avoid creating holes in the output sequence. You can do this by iterating over the rows and columns of the pixels separately and checking if any of the neighboring pixels are not 0 before setting the current pixel to 0.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence.
