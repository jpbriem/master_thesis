            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example_1: In this example, we can see that there are two groups of objects, one group with all zeros and another group with sixes. We can see that the objects in the second group are arranged symmetrically around the center object (which has value 6). The transformation rule seems to involve moving and copying these objects.\n  * Example_2: This example also shows two groups of objects, but this time they are arranged differently. The first group consists of zeros and the second group consists of sixes, but now the sixes are arranged in a zigzag pattern. It appears that the transformation involves removing some of the objects and rearranging them.\n  * Example_3: In this example, we again have two groups of objects, but this time they are arranged randomly. There doesn't seem to be any clear pattern in their arrangement. The transformation rule seems to involve moving and copying these objects.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * Input: A sequence of pixels where each pixel has a value from 1 to 9 representing different colors.\n  * Output: A sequence of pixels where each pixel has a value from 1 to 9 representing different colors, but with objects arranged according to a certain pattern.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and then apply the appropriate transformation rule to arrange them according to the desired pattern.\n  * You may need to use logical reasoning and creativity to come up with the correct transformation rule.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Object Description: Two groups of objects, one group with all zeros and another group with sixes. The objects in the second group are arranged symmetrically around the center object (which has value 6).\n  * Transformed Objects: The transformed objects should be arranged symmetrically around the center object (which still has value 6), just like in the original input sequence.\n  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output:\n\n  * Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\n\nNote: Since this is a text-based prompt, I cannot provide the exact output sequence without it being converted into a numerical array format. However, you can create a similar array using the given instructions and apply the transformation rules to obtain the desired output."
