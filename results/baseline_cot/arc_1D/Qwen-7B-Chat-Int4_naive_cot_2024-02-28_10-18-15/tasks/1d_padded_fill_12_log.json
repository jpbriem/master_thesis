            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

Specifically, it seems that each object has a starting point and an ending point, and the transformation involves moving the object from one point to another. Additionally, some of the objects appear to be modified in terms of their color or other properties.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform a new input into its output, we need to identify the objects present in the input and then apply the appropriate transformation to each object. Here are the steps we can follow:\n\n1. Identify the objects: We can use a method such as connected component analysis to identify the individual objects in the input image.\n\n2. Move objects: Once we have identified the objects, we can move them around using techniques such as translation or rotation.\n\n3. Recolor objects: If necessary, we can change the color of any objects in the input image.\n\n4. Remove objects: Finally, if any objects are no longer required, we can remove them from the output image.\n\nTransformation:\n\nHere's an example implementation of the above instructions:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\ndef transform(input_image):\n    # Step 1: Identify objects\n    objects = detect_objects(input_image)\n    \n    # Step 2: Move objects\n    for obj in objects:\n        x, y = obj['start']\n        w, h = obj['size']\n        dx, dy = obj['direction']\n        obj['end'] = (x + w, y + h)\n        \n        # Apply translation\n        input_image[y:y+h, x:x+w] += np.array([dx, dy])\n    \n    # Step 3: Recolor objects\n    # ...\n    \n    # Step 4: Remove objects\n    # ...\n\n    return input_image\n\n# Example usage\ninput_image = cv2.imread('example_input.png')\noutput_image = transform(input_image)\n\ncv2.imshow('Output', output_image)\ncv2.waitKey(0)\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\nNote that this is just one possible implementation, and there may be many ways to achieve the desired result depending on the specific requirements of the problem at hand."
