prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ 'description': { 'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains multiple instances of the object with color 6, starting at index 1 and ending at index 5. The output sequence removes these instances, leaving only one instance of color 6, starting at index 6.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence contains multiple instances of the object with color 6, starting at index 1 and ending at index 5. The output sequence removes these instances, leaving only one instance of color 6, starting at index 7.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, the input sequence contains multiple instances of the object with color 3, starting at index 1 and ending at index 8. The output sequence removes these instances, leaving only one instance of color 3, starting at index 9.' }, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input sequence, there is an object with a specific color. In the output sequence, this object is either removed entirely (if it occurs more than once) or replaced with a single instance of the same color, starting at a later index. This process can also involve moving the object to a different location in the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To transform a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:

  * Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color.
  * Determine if any of the identified objects occur more than once.
  * If so, remove all but one instance of that object.
  * If not, leave the input sequence unchanged.
  * Repeat this process for all identified objects in the input sequence.
  * Finally, adjust the positions of any remaining objects in the output sequence as necessary.

Note that the overall pattern involves removing or replacing instances of a specific object based on whether they occur more than once and where they appear in the input sequence. It does not involve any other types of transformations, such as scaling or recoloring objects. ', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence below:', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color:', 'transformed_objects': 'Remove all but one instance of each identified object, then adjust the positions of any remaining objects in the output sequence as necessary:', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence below:' }, 'test_output': 'numpy.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])' } }
```scss
import numpy as np

def transform(input_seq):
    # Identify objects in input sequence based on color
    objects = {}
    for i, color in enumerate(input_seq):
        if color == 0:
            continue
        if color not in objects:
            objects[color] = []
        objects[color].append(i)
    
    # Remove duplicates
    for color, indices in objects.items():
        if len(indices) > 1:
            objects[color] = [max(indices)]
    
    # Adjust positions of remaining objects
    output_seq = np.zeros_like(input_seq)
    for color, indices in objects.items():
        for i in indices:
            output_seq[i] = color
    
    return output_seq

# Test case
input_seq = np.array([0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
print(transform(input_seq))
```

Output:
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
