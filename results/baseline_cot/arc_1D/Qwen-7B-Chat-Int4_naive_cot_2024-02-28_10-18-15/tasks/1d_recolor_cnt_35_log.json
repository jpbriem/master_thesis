            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe given input-output pairs follow a pattern where each object in the input sequence is replaced by an object with similar properties but shifted horizontally by one position. Specifically, if an object has a starting index i and ending index j (i <= j), it is replaced by another object with the same color and starting index i+1 and ending index j+1. If there are no more objects to replace, the last object is simply copied. \n\nTo transform the input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, we can iterate over the input sequence and apply this replacement rule as follows:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list `objects` to store the transformed objects.\n2. Iterate over the input sequence using a sliding window approach, where we keep track of the current object's starting and ending indices and the next object's starting index.\n3. If the current object's starting index is less than the next object's starting index, append the current object to `objects`.\n4. Otherwise, create a new object with the same color and starting index as the current object plus one, and append it to `objects`. Repeat steps 3-4 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence.\n5. Return the `objects` list as the transformed output sequence.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement this transformation algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef transform(input):\n    objects = []\n    prev_start = None\n    for i in range(len(input)):\n        if prev_start is None:\n            obj = input[i:i+1]\n        else:\n            obj = input[prev_start:i+1]\n        while len(objects) > 0 and objects[-1][0] < obj[0]:\n            objects.pop()\n        if len(objects) == 0:\n            objects.append([obj])\n        else:\n            obj_start = max(objects[-1][1], obj[0]) + 1\n            obj_end = min(objects[-1][2], obj[1])\n            objects[-1].append(obj_start)\n            objects[-1].append(obj_end)\n        prev_start = obj_end\n    return objects\n\n# Test the function\nprint(transform([0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n```\n\nFor the given test case, the output would be `[0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nNote that the output sequence may contain multiple objects with the same color, depending on the number of objects present in the input sequence. Also, the output sequence will always have the same number of elements as the input sequence, even if some objects are removed during the transformation process."
