prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence has 1 object with color 6. This object starts at index 1 and ends at index 11. It spans across 10 positions.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence has 1 object with color 3. This object starts at index 1 and ends at index 11. It spans across 10 positions.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence has 1 object with color 5. This object starts at index 1 and ends at index 11. It spans across 10 positions.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that each input sequence has one object that starts at index 1 and ends at index 11. The object's color is always either 0 or one of the other numbers in the sequence (except for 0). The object spans across exactly 10 positions. In the output sequence, this object remains unchanged, but it may be placed differently, depending on the specific transformation applied.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to find the object in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation action(s) to it. Here are some general steps to follow:

  * Identify the object in the input sequence. Look for the largest contiguous block of the same color.
  * Determine what transformation actions to apply to the object. Some possible options include moving, scaling, removing, copying, recoloring, etc.
  * Apply the chosen transformation actions to the object.
  * Repeat these steps for any remaining objects in the input sequence.

For example, if the input sequence contains two objects - one blue and one red - and you want to make both objects appear next to each other without changing their relative positions, you could perform the following steps:

  * Find the blue object in the input sequence.
  * Copy the blue object twice, placing them next to each other.
  * Recolor the copied objects to red.

After applying these transformation actions, the resulting output sequence would contain three objects - two blue copies and one red copy - arranged side-by-side.', 'transformation': {'input': '[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]', 'object_description': 'The input sequence contains one object with color 8 that spans across 10 positions.', 'transformed_objects': 'The transformed objects should remain unchanged, except for their placement.

Specifically, they should be moved so that they are arranged side-by-side in the output sequence.', 'example_output': 'The example output sequence contains three objects - two blue copies and one red copy - arranged side-by-side.'}}, 'test_output': '[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0]'
