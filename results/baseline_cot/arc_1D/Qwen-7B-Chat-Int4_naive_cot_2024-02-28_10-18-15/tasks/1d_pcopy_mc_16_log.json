            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nDescription:\n\n  * Example 1: In this example, there are two objects, one of size 3 (from index 1 to index 3) and another of size 4 (from index 5 to index 8). Both objects are located at the beginning of the input sequence. After applying the transformation, the objects are moved to their final positions, which are now outside the boundaries of the input sequence. This results in a change of the objects' sizes and positions.\n  * Example 2: In this example, there are three objects, one of size 2 (from index 1 to index 2), one of size 3 (from index 4 to index 6), and another of size 1 (from index 8 to index 8). All objects are located at the beginning of the input sequence. After applying the transformation, the objects are scaled down by half and moved closer together. This results in a change of the objects' sizes and positions.\n  * Example 3: In this example, there are four objects, one of size 2 (from index 1 to index 2), one of size 3 (from index 4 to index 6), one of size 1 (from index 8 to index 8), and another of size 4 (from index 10 to index 14). All objects are located at the beginning of the input sequence. After applying the transformation, the object of size 2 is removed, and the remaining objects are rearranged so that they are no longer overlapping. This results in a change of the objects' sizes and positions.\n\nOverall Pattern:\n\n  * The overall pattern is that each input sequence has multiple objects of various sizes and positions. The transformation moves, scales, removes, copies, recolors, and arranges these objects in some way. The goal is to create an output sequence where the objects are arranged according to the desired pattern.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  * To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence using the `object_description` field. You can then apply the appropriate transformation operations to the objects using the `transformed_objects` field. Finally, you need to create the resulting output sequence using the `output` field.\n\nTransformation:\n\n  * Input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  * Object Description: There are three objects in this input sequence. The first object is of size 2 and starts at index 1. The second object is of size 3 and starts at index 4. The third object is of size 1 and starts at index 8.\n  * Transformed Objects: Move object 1 to index 14, move object 2 to index 10, and move object 3 to index 12. Scale object 1 by half. Resize object 2 to size 2. Resize object 3 to size 3. Recolor object 1 to red. Recolor object 2 to green. Recolor object 3 to blue. Remove object 3.\n  * Output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output:\n\n  * [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
