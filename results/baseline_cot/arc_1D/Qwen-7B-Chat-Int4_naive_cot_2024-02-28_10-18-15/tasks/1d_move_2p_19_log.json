            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has no objects, but the output sequence contains one object with the same color as the background (0).', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, there is an object in the input sequence, but it is not present in the output sequence. Instead, the background color (0) appears in the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'In Example_3, two objects appear in the input sequence, but they are both removed in the output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The input-output relationships for these examples involve removing or adding objects, as well as changing the color of some objects. In each example, the number of objects in the input and output sequences matches, but their positions and colors may differ.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input sequence into the output sequence, you can follow these steps:\n\n  * Identify any objects in the input sequence.\n  * Remove or add objects as necessary to match the number of objects in the output sequence.\n  * Change the color of any objects as necessary to match the colors in the output sequence.\n  * Ensure that the positions of all objects are correct relative to each other.\n\nFor example, in Example_1, you would need to identify the single object with color 0 in the input sequence and add it to the output sequence. In Example_2, you would need to remove the single object with color 6 from the input sequence. In Example_3, you would need to remove both objects with color 6 from the input sequence and change the color of the remaining object to 0.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence provided:', 'object_description': 'Identify the objects in the input sequence:', 'transformed_objects': 'Remove or add objects as necessary to match the number of objects in the output sequence:', 'output': 'Create the output sequence using the instructions above:', }, 'test_output': 'numpy.array([0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])'}"
