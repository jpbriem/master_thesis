prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
Description:

  * Example 1: In this example, the input sequence contains only one object, which has a size of 16 (from 1 to 16). It starts at index 1 and ends at index 16. The output sequence also contains only one object, which has the same size and position as the input object.
  * Example 2: This example shows two objects in the input sequence. The first object has a size of 8 (from 1 to 8) and starts at index 1 and ends at index 8. The second object has a size of 2 (from 1 to 2) and starts at index 9 and ends at index 11. Both objects are placed horizontally next to each other. The output sequence has three objects. The first object is identical to the input object. The second object is identical to the input object, but it has been rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees. The third object is identical to the input object, but it has been translated vertically downwards by 2 units.
  * Example 3: In this example, there are four objects in the input sequence. The first object has a size of 10 (from 1 to 10) and starts at index 1 and ends at index 10. The second object has a size of 5 (from 1 to 5) and starts at index 11 and ends at index 16. The third object has a size of 3 (from 1 to 3) and starts at index 17 and ends at index 20. The fourth object has a size of 2 (from 1 to 2) and starts at index 21 and ends at index 22. All objects are placed horizontally next to each other. The output sequence has five objects. The first object is identical to the input object. The second object is identical to the input object, but it has been rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees. The third object is identical to the input object, but it has been translated horizontally rightwards by 5 units. The fourth object is identical to the input object, but it has been translated vertically upwards by 3 units. The fifth object is identical to the input object, but it has been translated horizontally leftwards by 2 units.

Overall Pattern:

  * In all examples, the input and output sequences have the same number of objects. Each object in the input sequence corresponds to an object in the output sequence.
  * Each object in the input sequence has a unique size and position. These properties are preserved in the output sequence.
  * Each object in the input sequence can be rotated and translated. The rotation and translation operations are applied to the corresponding object in the output sequence.

Instructions:

  * To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the appropriate transformation operations to them.
  * Start by identifying the objects in the input sequence using the `object_description` field.
  * Once you have identified the objects, apply the appropriate transformation operations to them using the `transformed_objects` field.
  * Finally, create the resulting output sequence using the `output` field.

Transformation:

  * Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  * Description: There is only one object in the input sequence, which is translated vertically down by 2 units.
  * Transformed Objects: [Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 10, size: 10, translation: [-2, 0]}]
  * Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test Output:

  * Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!
    * [array([0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), array([0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])]

Note: The above solution assumes that the input sequence does not contain any noise pixels or duplicate objects. If either of these cases occurs, additional steps may be required to handle them.
