prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence has no objects. In the output sequence, there is one object with the color 3 and the size 2.', 'Example_2': 'In Example_2, the input sequence has two objects with the colors 5 and 6. In the output sequence, these objects remain unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern in these examples can be described as transforming an input sequence into an output sequence where each object is replaced by another object of the same color, but potentially with a different size and/or position. This process may involve moving, scaling, copying, recoloring, or removing objects.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and their characteristics (e.g., color, size, position). You then need to determine what action(s) to take to transform each object into its corresponding output object. These actions could include moving, scaling, copying, recoloring, or removing objects. You should also consider any conditions or constraints that apply to the transformation process. Once you have identified the appropriate actions to take and applied them to the input sequence, you will obtain the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there are four objects with the colors 0, 8, 8, and 8. Each object has the same size (8) and is located at the same position (the center of the sequence).', 'transformed_objects': 'To obtain the transformed output sequence, you would replace each object in the input sequence with a new object of the same color, but potentially with a different size and/or position. For example, you could replace the object with the color 0 with a new object with the color 8 and the same size (8), but positioned at the beginning of the sequence. Similarly, you could replace the object with the color 8 with a new object with the color 8 and the same size (8), but positioned at the end of the sequence. You could also choose to leave some objects unchanged, depending on your desired outcome. It is important to note that the specific actions taken will depend on the requirements of the transformation pattern.', 'output': 'Create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': '[[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]]'}
