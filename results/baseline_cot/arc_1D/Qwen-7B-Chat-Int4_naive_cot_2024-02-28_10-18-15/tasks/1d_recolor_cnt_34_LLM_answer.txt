prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example 1, the input sequence contains two groups of four identical objects, each group having a background color of 0. The output sequence shows the same objects but with a background color of 9. Each object has been shifted one position to the right.', 'Example_2': 'In Example 2, the input sequence also contains two groups of four identical objects, each group having a background color of 0. The output sequence shows the same objects but with a background color of 7. Each object has been shifted two positions to the left.', 'Example_3': 'In Example 3, the input sequence contains three groups of four identical objects, each group having a background color of 0. The output sequence shows the same objects but with a background color of 0. Each object has been shifted three positions to the right.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'All examples follow the same transformation pattern. Input sequences contain multiple groups of similar objects with a background color of 0. Output sequences show the same objects but with a different background color and shifted positions. This pattern can be described using simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) and logical conditions (equality).', ' instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, identify the groups of similar objects and shift their positions according to the desired output background color. If the background color is different than 0, add or subtract the appropriate number of pixels from each object. Check if the shifted objects still satisfy the condition of being similar to the original ones. If so, repeat the process until the output sequence is obtained. In this case, the transformation rule is to shift objects by one position to the right when the background color is 9, two positions to the left when the background color is 7, and no action when the background color is 0. Alternatively, you could use more complex transformations such as scaling, rotating, or applying filters to the objects. Note that these actions may affect the overall appearance of the output sequence and require careful consideration of the input sequence characteristics and constraints.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence below:', 'object_description': 'Identify the groups of similar objects in the input sequence. For example, in Example 1 there are two groups of four identical objects.', 'transformed_objects': 'Shift the objects according to the desired output background color. For example, in Example 1 shift the objects one position to the right when the background color is 9.', 'output': 'Create the output sequence by shifting the objects and changing the background color accordingly. Make sure to check if the transformed objects still satisfy the condition of being similar to the original ones. Repeat the process until the output sequence is obtained. Here is an example output sequence for the given input sequence:', 'example_output': '[[0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]'}, 'test_output': '[[0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]'}}
```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_seq):
    # Identify the groups of similar objects in the input sequence
    # Shift the objects according to the desired output background color
    # Create the output sequence by shifting the objects and changing the background color accordingly
    # Make sure to check if the transformed objects still satisfy the condition of being similar to the original ones
    # Repeat the process until the output sequence is obtained

input_seq = np.array([[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]])
