prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": { "Example_1": "In Example 1, the input sequence has 24 zeros followed by one 9. The output sequence has the same number of zeros but with each zero replaced by a 2, starting from the second element.", "Example_2": "In Example 2, the input sequence has 24 zeros followed by a 7. The output sequence has the same number of zeros but with each zero replaced by a 0, starting from the second element." }, "overall_pattern": "For both input-output pairs, the input sequence consists of 25 elements. Each element is either a 0 or a 9. The output sequence is obtained by replacing each 0 in the input sequence with the corresponding value from another sequence (either 2 or 0).", " instructions": "To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, you need to count the number of zeros in the input sequence. Once you know the number of zeros, you can replace each zero with the corresponding value from another sequence (either 2 or 0), depending on the value of the previous element. You also need to make sure that the resulting sequence has the same length as the original input sequence.", "transformation": {"input": "[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]", "object_description": "The object description refers to the fact that there are two types of objects in this input-output pair: the input sequence itself, and the other sequence used to generate the output sequence. The input sequence consists of 25 elements, while the other sequence consists of 25 elements that are either 0s or 9s.", "transformed_objects": "To create the transformed objects, you need to count the number of zeros in the input sequence (which is 25) and then replace each zero with the corresponding value from the other sequence. In this case, since the other sequence contains 25 elements, you will need to replace each zero with a 2, starting from the second element. Therefore, the transformed objects would be [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0].", "output": "[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]" } }
{ "test_output": "[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]" }
