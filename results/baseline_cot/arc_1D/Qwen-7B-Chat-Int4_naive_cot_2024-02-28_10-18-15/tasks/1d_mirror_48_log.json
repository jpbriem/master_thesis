The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In Example_1, the input sequence contains 16 pixels, each with value from 0 to 9, except for one pixel with value 0 representing the background color.

The output sequences contain pixels with values from 0 to 9, representing different colors.

The transformation involves moving, scaling, copying, recoloring, and removing objects from the input sequences to create the corresponding output sequences.', ' instructions': 'To transform a new input into its output, you need to identify the objects in the input sequence and apply the necessary transformation operations to them. You can use the provided examples as a reference for understanding the transformation patterns. For instance, if the input sequence contains multiple objects, you need to move, scale, copy, recolor, or remove these objects according to the transformation rules. Once you have applied the transformation operations to the objects, you can combine them into a single output sequence using the appropriate indexing conventions. Finally, make sure that the output sequence has the correct number of pixels and that they have the correct values and colors.', 'transformation': {'input': 'Copy the input sequence from the task.
