prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]

Sample Outputs:
{ "description": { "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has 8 objects, each object consists of 6 consecutive pixels of value 6. In the output sequence, one object is removed and replaced with another object consisting of 7 consecutive pixels of value 7.", "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence has 8 objects, each object consists of 2 consecutive pixels of value 2. In the output sequence, two objects are copied and pasted twice." }, "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern for these examples can be summarized as: an input sequence with n objects is transformed into an output sequence with n objects. Each object is either removed, replaced with another object of the same color, or copied and pasted multiple times." , "instructions": "To transform the given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, you need to follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence. An object is defined as a group of consecutive pixels of the same color.
  2. Remove any object that appears more than once in the input sequence.
  3. If there are any objects left in the input sequence, replace them with new objects of the same color. You can choose to copy and paste the old object multiple times or create a new object with a different number of pixels.
  4. Check if there are any empty spaces left in the input sequence after removing or replacing objects. If there are, add some noise pixels to fill up those spaces.
  5. Finally, count the number of objects in the input sequence and ensure that it matches the number of objects in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, we can identify three objects: [Object_1: {color: 6, start_index: 1, end_index: 8, size: 7}, Object_2: {color: 6, start_index: 9, end_index: 16, size: 7}, Object_3: {color: 6, start_index: 17, end_index: 24, size: 7}]. We can then remove Object_2 since it appears twice, and replace it with a new object of the same color. After filling up any empty spaces with noise pixels, we get the output sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7].

For Example_2, we can identify four objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 2, start_index: 5, end_index: 8, size: 3}, Object_3: {color: 2, start_index: 9, end_index: 12, size: 3}, Object_4: {color: 2, start_index: 13, end_index: 16, size: 3}]. We can then copy and paste Object_2 twice to get the output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7].

For Example_3, we can identify five objects: [Object_1: {color: 6, start_index: 1, end_index: 8, size: 7}, Object_2: {color: 6, start_index: 9, end_index: 16, size: 7}, Object_3: {color: 6, start_index: 17, end_index: 24, size: 7}, Object_4: {color: 5, start_index: 25, end_index: 32, size: 7}, Object_5: {color: 5, start_index: 33, end_index: 40, size: 7}]. We can then remove Object_1 and replace it with a new object consisting of 7 consecutive pixels of value 7. After filling up any empty spaces with noise pixels, we get the output sequence: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]." }
