prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
output: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



### Example_1

#### Description

Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!

#### Overall Pattern

The overall pattern is that each object has a fixed size (in this case it's always one) and moves along the sequence until it reaches an edge. At that point it stops moving and stays at the edge.

#### Instructions

First we need to define what an object is. In our case, an object is any nonzero value in the sequence. We can then create a function that takes in the current index and returns whether or not there is an object present at that location. If so, return True; otherwise False.

Next, we want to know if two objects are adjacent. This means that they are both at the same index. To do this, we will check if the current index is greater than the previous index plus one. If so, then the objects are adjacent.

Now that we know where the objects are located, we can determine their direction. If the current index is less than the previous index, then the object is moving left. Otherwise, it is moving right.

Finally, we need to know when an object reaches an edge. An edge occurs whenever the current index equals the maximum index minus one. Once an object reaches an edge, it remains stationary until another object arrives at that spot.

Once we understand these basic principles, we can begin implementing them using Python code. First, let’s write some helper functions to make things easier.

```python
def get_current_index(sequence):
    """Get the current index in a given sequence."""
    return len(sequence)-1

def is_adjacent(i, j):
    """Check if two indices i and j are adjacent."""
    return i < j + 1

def is_edge(i, max_index):
    """Check if an index i is equal to the maximum index - 1."""
    return i == max_index - 1
```

We now have everything we need to implement our main algorithm. Let’s start by defining a class called “Object” that holds information about an individual object.

```python
class Object():
    def __init__(self, color=None, size=1, pos=-1):
        self._color = color
        self._size = size
        self._pos = pos
    
    @property
    def color(self):
        return self._color
    
    @color.setter
    def color(self, color):
        self._color = color
        
    @property
    def size(self):
        return self._size
    
    @size.setter
    def size(self, size):
        self._size = size
        
    @property
    def pos(self):
        return self._pos
    
    @pos.setter
    def pos(self, pos):
        self._pos = pos
```

Next, let’s define a method called “move”. It takes in an object and updates its position according to the current index.

```python
def move(obj, index):
    obj.pos += 1
    if obj.pos >= index+1:
        obj.pos -= 1
```

Finally, let’s define a method called “check_for_edge”, which checks if an object has reached an edge.

```python
def check_for_edge(obj, max_index):
    if obj.pos == max_index - 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

With these methods defined, we can now implement our main algorithm.

```python
def transform(sequence):
    # Initialize variables
    objects = []
    current_index = get_current_index(sequence)
    max_index = len(sequence) - 1
    
    while current_index!= max_index:
        # Get the next object
        obj = None
        for o in objects:
            if o.pos <= current_index:
                obj = o
                
        # Check if the object is adjacent to another object
        if obj is not None:
            if is_adjacent(obj.pos, current_index):
                pass
            
        elif is_edge(current_index, max_index):
            break
        
        # Move the object
        if obj is not None:
            move(obj, current_index)
            
        # Add the object to the list of objects
        objects.append(obj)
        
        # Update the current index
        current_index += 1
        
        # Check if the object has reached an edge
        if check_for_edge(obj, max_index):
            break
```

Now that we have implemented our main algorithm, let’s run it on the provided test cases.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Example_1')
    sequence = [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    result = transform(sequence)
    assert result == [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    
    print()
    print('Example_2')
    sequence = [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
    result = transform(sequence)
    assert result == [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]
    
    print()
    print('Example_3')
    sequence = [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    result = transform(sequence)
    assert result == [6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
