            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\n### Example_1\n\n#### Description\n\nRegarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\n\n#### Overall Pattern\n\nThe overall pattern is that each object has a fixed size (in this case it's always one). Each object starts at index 1 and ends at index n+1.\n\n#### Instructions\n\nFirst we need to create an empty list where we will store our objects. We then iterate through the input sequence and check if the current value is equal to 0. If so, we add another object to our list. Otherwise, we simply append the current value to the next object.\n\nOnce we have iterated over the entire sequence, we can now print out the objects in order.\n\n#### Transformation\n\nWe need to copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!\n\nWe also need to describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color.\n\nIn this case there is just one object. It has a fixed size of 1 and starts at index 1.\n\n#### Test Output\n\nCreate the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\n#### Return Value\n\nReturn the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\n\n### Example_2\n\n#### Description\n\nRegarding the second example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\n\n#### Overall Pattern\n\nThe overall pattern is that each object has a fixed size (in this case it's always two) and starts at index 1. They do not overlap but they may align vertically.\n\n#### Instructions\n\nFirst we need to create an empty list where we will store our objects. We then iterate through the input sequence and check if the current value is equal to 0. If so, we add another object to our list.

Mind the sequence length!\n\nWe also need to describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color.\n\nThere are three objects here. Two of them have a fixed size of 2 and start at index 1. One of these objects does not overlap any other object but it does align vertically with the other object.\n\n#### Test Output\n\nCreate the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\n#### Return Value\n\nReturn the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!\n\n### Example_3\n\n#### Description\n\nRegarding the third example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\n\n#### Overall Pattern\n\nThe overall pattern is that each object has a fixed size (in this case it's always four) and starts at index 1. They do not overlap but they may align horizontally.\n\n#### Instructions\n\nFirst we need to create an empty list where we will store our objects. We then iterate through the input sequence and check if the current value is equal to 0. If so, we add another object to our list.

Four of them have a fixed size of 4 and start at index 1. One of these objects does not overlap any other object but it does align horizontally with the other object.\n\n#### Test Output\n\nCreate the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!\n\n#### Return Value\n\nReturn the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!"
