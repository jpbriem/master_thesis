            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\noutput: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\n### Example_1\n\n#### Description\n\nRegarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\n\n#### Overall Pattern\n\nThe overall pattern is that each object has a fixed size (in this case it's always one) and moves along the sequence until it reaches an edge. At that point it stops moving and stays at the edge.\n\n#### Instructions\n\nFirst we need to define what an object is. In our case, an object is any nonzero value in the sequence. We can then create a function that takes in the current index and returns whether or not there is an object present at that location. If so, return True; otherwise False.\n\nNext, we want to know if two objects are adjacent. This means that they are both at the same index. To do this, we will check if the current index is greater than the previous index plus one. If so, then the objects are adjacent.\n\nNow that we know where the objects are located, we can determine their direction. If the current index is less than the previous index, then the object is moving left. Otherwise, it is moving right.\n\nFinally, we need to know when an object reaches an edge. An edge occurs whenever the current index equals the maximum index minus one. Once an object reaches an edge, it remains stationary until another object arrives at that spot.\n\nOnce we understand these basic principles, we can begin implementing them using Python code. First, let\u2019s write some helper functions to make things easier.\n\n```python\ndef get_current_index(sequence):\n    \"\"\"Get the current index in a given sequence.\"\"\"\n    return len(sequence)-1\n\ndef is_adjacent(i, j):\n    \"\"\"Check if two indices i and j are adjacent.\"\"\"\n    return i < j + 1\n\ndef is_edge(i, max_index):\n    \"\"\"Check if an index i is equal to the maximum index - 1.\"\"\"\n    return i == max_index - 1\n```\n\nWe now have everything we need to implement our main algorithm. Let\u2019s start by defining a class called \u201cObject\u201d that holds information about an individual object.\n\n```python\nclass Object():\n    def __init__(self, color=None, size=1, pos=-1):\n        self._color = color\n        self._size = size\n        self._pos = pos\n    \n    @property\n    def color(self):\n        return self._color\n    \n    @color.setter\n    def color(self, color):\n        self._color = color\n        \n    @property\n    def size(self):\n        return self._size\n    \n    @size.setter\n    def size(self, size):\n        self._size = size\n        \n    @property\n    def pos(self):\n        return self._pos\n    \n    @pos.setter\n    def pos(self, pos):\n        self._pos = pos\n```\n\nNext, let\u2019s define a method called \u201cmove\u201d. It takes in an object and updates its position according to the current index.\n\n```python\ndef move(obj, index):\n    obj.pos += 1\n    if obj.pos >= index+1:\n        obj.pos -= 1\n```\n\nFinally, let\u2019s define a method called \u201ccheck_for_edge\u201d, which checks if an object has reached an edge.\n\n```python\ndef check_for_edge(obj, max_index):\n    if obj.pos == max_index - 1:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nWith these methods defined, we can now implement our main algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    # Initialize variables\n    objects = []\n    current_index = get_current_index(sequence)\n    max_index = len(sequence) - 1\n    \n    while current_index!= max_index:\n        # Get the next object\n        obj = None\n        for o in objects:\n            if o.pos <= current_index:\n                obj = o\n                \n        # Check if the object is adjacent to another object\n        if obj is not None:\n            if is_adjacent(obj.pos, current_index):\n                pass\n            \n        elif is_edge(current_index, max_index):\n            break\n        \n        # Move the object\n        if obj is not None:\n            move(obj, current_index)\n            \n        # Add the object to the list of objects\n        objects.append(obj)\n        \n        # Update the current index\n        current_index += 1\n        \n        # Check if the object has reached an edge\n        if check_for_edge(obj, max_index):\n            break\n```\n\nNow that we have implemented our main algorithm, let\u2019s run it on the provided test cases.\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print('Example_1')\n    sequence = [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    result = transform(sequence)\n    assert result == [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n    print()\n    print('Example_2')\n    sequence = [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n    result = transform(sequence)\n    assert result == [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n    print()\n    print('Example_3')\n    sequence = [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    result = transform(sequence)\n    assert result == [6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n"
