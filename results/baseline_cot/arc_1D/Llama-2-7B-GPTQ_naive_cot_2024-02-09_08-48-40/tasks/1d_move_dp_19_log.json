            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n\n\n### Example_1\n\n#### Description\n\nRegarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\n\n#### Overall Pattern\n\nThe overall pattern is that each object is moved one unit forward (or backward) depending on its direction.\n\n#### Instructions\n\nFirst, we need to define what an object is. An object is defined by its color, starting index, ending index, and size.\n\nNext, we need to define the noise pixels. A noise pixel is any pixel whose color does not match the current object's color.\n\nNow, we can define the arithmetical operations. We will count the number of noise pixels and sort them according to their color.\n\nFinally, we can define the conditions. If there are no noise pixels, then the object is removed. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.\n\n#### Transformation\n\nWe begin by copying the input sequence into our working space. Next, we iterate through every object in order to perform the necessary transformations.\n\nFor each object, we check if it has been modified yet. If so, we continue iterating until we find another object that hasn't been modified yet. Once we do, we modify this object using the appropriate transformation rule.\n\nIf the object has already been modified, then we skip over it and proceed to the next iteration. This ensures that we don't accidentally modify multiple objects at once.\n\nOnce we reach the end of the input sequence without modifying any more objects, we know that we have finished processing all of the objects in our working space. At this point, we simply return the final result as our answer.\n\n#### Test Output\n\nThe test output is just a simple copy of the original input sequence. There are no modifications made during testing since we want to ensure that our algorithm works correctly regardless of whether or not there are any noise pixels present in the input data set.\n\n### Example_2\n\n#### Description\n\nRegarding the second example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\n\n#### Overall Pattern\n\nThe overall pattern is that each object is moved one unit forward (or backward) depending on its direction.\n\n#### Instructions\n\nFirst, we need to define what an object is.
