            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\n### Example_1\n\n#### Description\n\nRegarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\n\n#### Overall Pattern\n\nThe overall pattern is that each object has a fixed size (in this case it's always one). Each object can either be removed or copied. If an object is moved, then it will be shifted by one unit.\n\n#### Instructions\n\nIf you want to create a new input sequence, just copy the given input sequence.\n\nThen, if there is no noise pixel, simply copy the whole sequence again. Otherwise, remove any noise pixel.\n\nNext, check whether there is an object. If so, do the following:\n* If the object is empty, remove it.\n* Else, if the object is aligned with another object, remove both objects.\n* Else, if the object is overlapping with another object, remove them both.\n* Else, if the object is contained inside another object, remove both objects.\n* Else, if the object is adjacent to another object, remove both objects.\n* Else, if the object is distant enough from other objects, keep it.\n* Else, if the object is too close to other objects, remove it.\n\nFinally, sort the remaining objects according to their distance.\n\n#### Transformation\n\nInput:\n```\n[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nFirstly, we need to remove the noise pixels. In this case, they are at index 5 and 7.\n\nSecondly, we need to check whether there is an object. There is one object here, namely Object_1.\n\nThirdly, we need to check whether the object is aligned with another object. It is not.\n\nFourthly, we need to check whether the object is overlapping with another object. It is not.\n\nFifthly, we need to check whether the object is contained inside another object. It is not.\n\nSixthly, we need to check whether the object is adjacent to another object. It is not.\n\nSeventhly, we need to check whether the object is distant enough from other objects. It is not.\n\nEighthly, we need to check whether the object is too close to other objects. It is not.\n\nNinthly, we need to sort the remaining objects according to their distance.\n\nLastly, we need to copy the whole sequence again.\n\n\n### Example_2\n\n#### Description\n\nRegarding the second example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!\n\n#### Overall Pattern\n\nThe overall pattern is that each object has a fixed size (in this case it's always one).
