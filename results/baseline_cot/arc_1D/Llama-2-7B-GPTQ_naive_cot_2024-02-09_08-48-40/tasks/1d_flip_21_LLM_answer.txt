prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

### Example_1

#### Description

Regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!

#### Overall Pattern

The overall pattern is that each object is moved one unit forward (or backward) depending on its direction.

#### Instructions

First, we need to define what an object is. An object is defined by its color, starting index, ending index, and size.

Next, we need to define the noise pixels. A noise pixel is any pixel whose color does not match the current object's color.

Now, we can begin our transformation. We will go through each object individually.

Object_1:

We want to move this object two units forward. To do so, we must find the nearest neighboring object. In this case, it is Object_2.

We then subtract the starting index of Object_2 from the starting index of Object_1. This gives us the number of steps to take before reaching Object_2.

We then add the ending index of Object_2 to the ending index of Object_1. This gives us the number of steps after passing Object_2.

Finally, we multiply these numbers together to get the total number of steps to take.

Once we know the total number of steps, we simply iterate over them until we reach the ending index of Object_1.

Object_2:

Similarly, we want to move this object three units forward. However, there is no other object to pass, so we just move directly forward.

Object_3:

There is nothing special about this object, so we leave it alone.

Noise Pixels:

These are ignored.

Counting:

Sorting:

### Example_2

#### Description

Regarding the second example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!

#### Overall Pattern

The overall pattern is that each object is moved one unit forward (or backward) depending on its direction.

#### Instructions

First, we need to define what an object is. An object is defined by its color, starting index, ending index, and size.

Next, we need to define the noise pixels. A noise pixel is any pixel whose color does not match the current object's color.

Now, we can begin our transformation. We will go through each object individually.

Object_1:

We want to move this object four units forward. To do so, we must find the nearest neighboring object. In this case, it is Object_2.

We then subtract the starting index of Object_2 from the starting index of Object_1. This gives us the number of steps to take before reaching Object_2.

We then add the ending index of Object_2 to the ending index of Object_1. This gives us the number of steps after passing Object_2.

Finally, we multiply these numbers together to get the total number of steps to take.

Once we know the total number of steps, we simply iterate over them until we reach the ending index of Object_1.

Object_2:

Similarly, we want to move this object eight units forward. However, there is no other object to pass, so we just move directly forward.

Object_3:

There is nothing special about this object, so we leave it alone.

Noise Pixels:

These are ignored.

### Example_3

#### Description

Regarding the third example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!

#### Overall Pattern

The overall pattern is that each object is moved one unit forward (or backward) depending on its direction.

#### Instructions

First, we need to define what an object is. An object is defined by its color, starting index, ending index, and size.

Next, we need to define the noise pixels. A noise pixel is any pixel whose color does not match the current object's color.

Now, we can begin our transformation. We will go through each object individually.

Object_1:

We want to move this object seven units forward. To do so, we must find the nearest neighboring object. In this case, it is Object_2.

We then subtract the starting index of Object_2 from the starting index of Object_1. This gives us the number of steps to take before reaching Object_2.

We then add the ending index of Object_2 to the ending index of Object_1. This gives us the number of steps after passing Object_2.

Finally, we multiply these numbers together to get the total number of steps to take.

Once we know the total number of steps, we simply iterate over them until we reach the ending index of Object_1.

Object_2:

Similarly, we want to move this object five units forward. However, there is no other object to pass, so we just move directly forward.

Object_3:

There is nothing special about this object, so we leave it alone.

Noise Pixels:

These are ignored.
