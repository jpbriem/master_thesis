The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

In the output, this object has been transformed to have a hole in the middle, with the first and last pixels maintaining their color, resulting in two separate objects of color 2 with a size of 1 each.\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"Similarly to Example 1, the continuous object of color 4 from index 0 to index 2 in the input sequence has been changed in the output to have a hole in the middle, leaving two pixels of color 4 at the start and end of the original object.\",\n    \"Example_3\": \"Following the same transformation pattern, the object of color 7 from index 6 to index 8 in the input sequence has been altered to include a hole in the middle, creating two objects of color 7 at the beginning and end of the original object with a size of 1 each.\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"For all input-output pairs, the transformation involves creating a hole in the center of each object. If the object has an even size, the hole is one pixel wide, placed in the center. If the object has an odd size, the center pixel is kept, and the hole is created just before the center pixel. This transformation only applies to objects of size greater than 1.\",\n  \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, identify the objects, then create a hole in the object by setting the middle pixel(s) to the background color (0). If the object size is even, change the middle pixel to 0. If the object size is odd, change the pixel just before the middle to 0.
