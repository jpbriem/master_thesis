You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "Single-color objects of size 1 in the input sequence are scaled to size 4 in the output sequence, and the transformed object starts at the original object's starting index.",
        "Example_2": "Similar to Example_1, the single-color object of size 1 is scaled to size 4, with the transformation starting at the object's starting index in the input sequence.",
        "Example_3": "Following the same pattern, the single-color object of size 1 becomes size 4 in the output, beginning at the same starting index as in the input."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Single-color objects of size 1 in the input are scaled up to size 4 in the output, beginning at the same starting index. Any additional space beyond the object's new size remains as background color.",
    "instructions": "Identify single-color objects of size 1 in the input sequence. Replace these objects with an object of the same color but with a size of 4, starting at the same index. Fill the rest of the sequence with the background color if necessary.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
        "object_description": "There are two objects: Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 1, size: 1}, Object_2: {color: 4, start_index: 3, end_index: 3, size: 1}.",
        "transformed_objects": "The transformed objects should be: Transformed_Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}, Transformed_Object_2: {color: 4, start_index: 3, end_index: 6, size: 4}. Since the objects overlap, the final object will cover indices 1 to 6.",

    },
