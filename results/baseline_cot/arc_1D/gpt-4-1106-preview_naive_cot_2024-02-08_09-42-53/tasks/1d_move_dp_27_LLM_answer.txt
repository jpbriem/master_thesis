You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]

Sample Outputs:
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "The object with color 1 was shifted to the right by 3 positions, while the object with color 9 remained in the same position.",
        "Example_2": "The object with color 7 was shifted to the right by 1 position, while the object with color 9 was shifted to the left by 1 position.",
        "Example_3": "The object with color 2 was shifted to the right by 3 positions, while the object with color 9 remained in the same position."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "All objects except the last object are shifted to the right until they are one position away from either another object or the end of the sequence. The last object stays in the same position if it is at the end of the sequence, otherwise it shifts to the left until it is one position away from the previous object.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: 1. Identify all distinct objects in the sequence based on color. 2. Shift the first object to the right until it is one position away from the next object or the end of the sequence. Repeat for subsequent objects except the last one. 3. If the last object is not already at the end of the sequence, shift it to the left until it is one position away from the previous object.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]",
        "object_description": "Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 9, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}",
        "transformed_objects": "Object_1 should be shifted to the right by 2 positions, starting at index 3 and ending at index 5. Object_2 should remain at the same position, starting and ending at index 8.",
