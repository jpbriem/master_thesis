You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "The single object of color 5 in the input is expanded to fill the space between its first and last occurrence, creating a contiguous block of color 5.",
    "Example_2": "Similarly to Example_1, the object of color 7 is expanded to fill the entire space between the first and last pixel of color 7.",
    "Example_3": "The object of color 2 is expanded to the left, filling the space between the first and last occurrence, while the background color on the right side remains the same."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "For each pair of same-colored objects, the space between the first and last occurrence of that color is filled with the same color, effectively expanding the objects to create one contiguous block of that color. If there are multiple objects of the same color, they are merged into a single object. If there is only one object, it remains unchanged.",
  "instructions": "Identify pairs of objects with the same color. Fill the space between the first and last occurrence of each color with the same color to form a contiguous block. If there is only one object of a color, do not modify it.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
    "object_description": "There are two objects of color 7, with the first object at position 0 and the second object at position 4. Each object is of size 1.",
    "transformed_objects": "The two objects of color 7 should be expanded to create a contiguous block of color 7 starting at position 0 and ending at position 4.",
    "output": "[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

  "test_output": "numpy.array([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])"
