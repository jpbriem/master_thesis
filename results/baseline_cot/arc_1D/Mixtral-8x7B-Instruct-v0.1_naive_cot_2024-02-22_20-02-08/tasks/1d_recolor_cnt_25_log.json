            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON format response to the given problem:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input sequence contains two horizontal lines of object_4 at positions 2-3 and 7-8, while the output sequence has three horizontal lines of object_6 at positions 2-4, 7-8, and 11-11, one line of object_2 at positions 5-6, and one line of object_8 at positions 10-10. Therefore, the differences between the input and output sequences are that some of the original object_4's were replaced by other objects (object_6, object_2, and object_8), and their positions and sizes were adjusted accordingly.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"Similar to Example_1, but with different positions and sizes of the objects.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence containing object_n's, where n can be any integer value from 1 to 9, the output sequence will replace some of the object_n's with other objects (let's call them object_m) according to a specific rule set, adjusting their positions and sizes accordingly. Some noise pixels may also appear in the output sequence.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:<br>1.
