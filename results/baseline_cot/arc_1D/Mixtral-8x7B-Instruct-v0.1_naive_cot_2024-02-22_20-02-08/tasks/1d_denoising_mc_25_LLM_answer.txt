prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input and output sequences differ in the way the consecutive pixels of color 7 are treated. In the input sequence, there are two groups of 7's separated by a single 8. However, in the output sequence, these gaps are filled with 7's so that there is only one continuous group of 7's.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, there are three separate groups of 7's in the input sequence, while the output sequence has them merged into one continuous group."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence, if there are multiple groups of consecutive identical pixels (i.e., objects) separated by other pixels (noise), then the output sequence will merge all those groups into one continuous group of identical pixels.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n1. Identify all the objects (consecutive identical pixels) in the input sequence.\n2. Merge all the identical pixels together, ignoring any noise pixels separating them.\n3. Create the output sequence by placing the merged objects back into their original positions.",

        "object_description": "There are four objects in the input sequence: [(5, 6, 4), (8, 13, 1), (7, 28, 1), (0, 30, 3)] where each tuple denotes (pixel_value, start_index, length).",
        "transformed_objects": "After merging the identical pixels, we get: [(5, 6, 10), (8, 13, 2), (7, 28, 1), (0, 30, 3)]",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]"

Explanation:

* Description: We explain the differences between the input and output sequences for Examples 1 and 2.
* Overall Pattern: If there are multiple groups of identical pixels separated by other pixels, the output sequence will merge all those groups into one continuous group of identical pixels.
* Instructions: To transform a new input sequence, identify the objects, merge the identical pixels together, and place the merged objects back into their original positions.
* Transformation:
	+ Input: Copy the test case input sequence.
	+ Object Description: Describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, and color.
	+ Transformed Objects: Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, and color.
	+ Output: Create the resulting test output sequence.
