            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the object with color 6 moved one index to the left if there was no noise pixel (0) before it.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, the object with color 2 moved three indices to the right if there were at least three noise pixels (0) before it.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"In Example_3, the object with color 6 moved two indices to the right if there were no noise pixels (0) after it.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence, each object moves a certain number of indices determined by the number of noise pixels before or after it.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: 1) Identify the objects and their positions in the input sequence. 2) Determine the number of noise pixels before or after each object. 3) Move each object a certain number of indices based on the number of noise pixels before or after it.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There are two objects in the input sequence: one with color 2 starting at index 5 and ending at index 7, and another with color 3 starting at index 10 and ending at index 10.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"The object with color 2 will move four indices to the right since there are four noise pixels (0) before it.
