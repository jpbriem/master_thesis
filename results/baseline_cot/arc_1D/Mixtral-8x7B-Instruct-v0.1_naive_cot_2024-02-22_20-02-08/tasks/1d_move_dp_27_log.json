            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON format response you requested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input sequence contains a horizontal line of 5 white pixels at the beginning of the sequence. In the output sequence, this line has been moved to the end of the sequence.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence contains a horizontal line of 4 black pixels followed by a block of 4 green pixels. In the output sequence, the black pixels have been moved to the beginning of the sequence, while the green pixels remain unchanged.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"In Example_3, the input sequence contains a horizontal line of 3 red pixels followed by three zeros. In the output sequence, the red pixels have been moved to the end of the sequence.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence containing one or more blocks of consecutive pixels (referred to as 'objects') separated by noise pixels (zeros), the output sequence moves each object to the end of the sequence, maintaining their relative order.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Identify each contiguous group of non-zero pixels as an object.\\n2. Sort the objects in reverse order according to their starting index.\\n3. Concatenate the sorted objects together, inserting zeros between them if necessary to maintain the original spacing.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\",\n        \"object_description\": \"There are two objects in the input sequence: a block of 3 green pixels starting at index 1, and a single blue pixel at index 8.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"The transformed objects will consist of the same green and blue pixels, but arranged in reverse order: the blue pixel will appear first, followed by the green pixels.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n}\n```"
