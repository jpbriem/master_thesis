prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response you requested:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains two horizontal blocks of color 7, each of length 4. In the output sequence, these blocks have been replaced by two horizontal blocks of color 3 (of the same length) and one vertical block of color 9 (also of the same height).",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence contains three horizontal blocks of color 7, one vertical block of color 7, and some noise pixels. In the output sequence, the horizontal blocks have been shifted towards the left, the vertical block has been replaced by a horizontal block of color 9, and the noise pixels remain unchanged.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the input sequence contains one horizontal block of color 7 followed by a larger horizontal block of color 7, and some noise pixels. In the output sequence, the smaller block has been replaced by a vertical block of color 9, while the larger block has been replaced by six horizontal blocks of color 3."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence containing horizontal and/or vertical blocks of color 7, possibly interspersed with noise pixels, replace each block of color 7 with a transformed version of itself, where the transformation depends on the shape and position of the block relative to other blocks of color 7.",
    "instructions": "To transform a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify all connected components of color 7 in the input sequence.\n2. For each component, determine its shape (horizontal or vertical), size, and position relative to other components.\n3. Apply the appropriate transformation to each component based on its shape, size, and position, as follows:\n   - Horizontal components of length 4 or more become vertical components of height 4 or more, centered vertically and horizontally within the original component's bounding box.\n   - Smaller horizontal components become horizontal components of color 3, also centered horizontally within the original component's bounding box.\n   - Vertical components of height 4 or more become horizontal components of color 9, centered horizontally within the original component's bounding box.\n4. Leave any noise pixels (i.e., isolated pixels of color 7) unchanged.",
