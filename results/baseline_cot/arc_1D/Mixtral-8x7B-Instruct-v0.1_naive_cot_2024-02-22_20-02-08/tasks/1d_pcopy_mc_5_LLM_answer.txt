prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object with color 8 in the input sequence moves to the right by one position and changes its size from 3 to 2. Additionally, the noise pixel value 6 replaces the original object's last two positions.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the object with color 4 remains stationary while changing its size from 3 to 4. The noise pixel value 2 replaces the original object's last position."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "For each input sequence, an object made up of consecutive pixels with the same non-zero value (except for the first and last elements) will either remain stationary and change its size or move to the right by one position and maintain its size. In both cases, the replaced positions will be filled with the noise pixel value located immediately before the object in the input sequence.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input sequence, follow these steps: \n1. Identify the object(s) in the input sequence.\n2. Determine if the object will stay stationary or move to the right by checking whether the noise pixel value is smaller than the object's value.\n3. If the object stays stationary, increase its size by adding the noise pixel value at its beginning and end.\n4. If the object moves to the right, add the noise pixel value at its original position and remove it from the beginning and end.\n5. Fill the replaced positions with the noise pixel value.",

        "object_description": "There are two objects in this input sequence: Object_1 has a color value of 9, starting at index 2, ending at index 4, and originally having a size of 3; Object_2 has a color value of 9, starting at index 10, ending at index 10, and originally having a size of 1.",
        "transformed_objects": "Object_1 will grow to a size of 5, replacing indices 0, 1, 13, and 14 with the noise pixel value 9. Object_2 will move to the right by one position and grow to a size of 3, replacing indices 11, 12, and 15 with the noise pixel value 0.",
