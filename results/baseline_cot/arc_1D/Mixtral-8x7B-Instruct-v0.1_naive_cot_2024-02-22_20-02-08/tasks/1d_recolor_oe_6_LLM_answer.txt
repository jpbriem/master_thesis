prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input contains two horizontal groups of 7's, one at the beginning and one near the end. In the output, these groups of 7's have been replaced with 4's and 6's respectively, maintaining their horizontal grouping but changing their positions slightly. Additionally, the sizes of both groups have been reduced.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input contains three horizontal groups of 7's, one at the beginning, one in the middle, and one near the end. In the output, these groups of 7's have been replaced with 4's and 6's respectively, maintaining their horizontal grouping but changing their positions slightly. Additionally, the sizes of all groups have been reduced."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The input consists of horizontal groups of identical numbers (excluding 0), where each group may appear once or multiple times. The output replaces each group with another group of the same length, consisting of either 4's or 6's, arranged horizontally while preserving the relative positions of the original groups. The specific replacement depends on the number in the input group and its position within the input sequence.",
    "instructions": "To transform an input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:
    1. Identify all horizontal groups of identical numbers (excluding 0) in the input sequence.
    2. Replace each group according to the following rules:
        - If the group consists of 7's and it is the first group in the input sequence, replace it with a group of 4's.
        - If the group consists of 7's and it is the last group in the input sequence, replace it with a group of 6's.
        - If the group consists of 7's and it is neither the first nor the last group, replace it with a group of 6's if it appears before the first 7 group; otherwise, replace it with a group of 4's.
    3. Preserve the relative positions of the replaced groups in the output sequence.",
