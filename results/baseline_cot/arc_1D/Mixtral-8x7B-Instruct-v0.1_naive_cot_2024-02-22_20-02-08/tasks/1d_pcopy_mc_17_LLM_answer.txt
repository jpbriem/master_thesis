prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, object_1 (color 5) in the input sequence moves three places to the right and overlaps with object_2 (color 3), becoming one larger object in the output sequence.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, object_1 (color 1) in the input sequence moves two places to the left and merges with object_2 (color 2), creating a larger object of color 1 in the output sequence. Object_3 (color 7) also moves to the right, occupying the previous positions of object_2."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence, each object moves to the position of the next object of higher value while retaining its own value. If there is no next object of higher value, it remains at its current position. After moving, if any two adjacent objects have the same value, they merge into a single object of that value.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n1. Identify each object's starting and ending indices, color, and size.\n2. Starting from the lowest valued object, determine the target index for movement by finding the starting index of the next object with a higher value.\n3. Move the identified object to the determined target index, updating the starting and ending indices accordingly.\n4. Merge adjacent objects with the same value.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all objects have been processed.",

        "input": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are four objects in this input sequence: {\"color\": 1, \"start_index\": 1, \"end_index\": 3, \"size\": 3}, {\"color\": 4, \"start_index\": 6, \"end_index\": 6, \"size\": 1}, {\"color\": 9, \"start_index\": 11, \"end_index\": 11, \"size\": 1}",
        "transformed_objects": "After applying the overall pattern, the transformed objects will be: {\"color\": 1, \"start_index\": 1, \"end_index\": 3, \"size\": 3}, {\"color\": 4, \"start_index\": 8, \"end_index\": 8, \"size\": 1}, {\"color\": 9, \"start_index\": 11, \"end_index\": 11, \"size\": 1}",
