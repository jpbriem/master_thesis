prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object with color 4 in the input sequence moves to the right by one position and overlaps with the object with color 8. Additionally, the object with color 8 in the input sequence expands to the left by two positions.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the object with color 2 in the input sequence moves to the right by one position and overlaps with the object with color 7. Similarly, the object with color 7 in the input sequence expands to the left by three positions and overlaps with the object with color 8."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence, each non-background pixel (i.e., non-zero) triggers a movement of itself and the neighboring background pixels to the right until it reaches another non-background pixel. During this movement, if the moving pixel encounters a non-background pixel, they merge together and form a single object with the merged color. If the moving pixel does not encounter any other non-background pixel during its movement, then it simply moves to the last position in the sequence.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n1. Iterate over each non-background pixel in the input sequence.\n2. For each non-background pixel, find the next non-background pixel to its right.\n3. Move the current non-background pixel and all background pixels to the right of it up to but excluding the next non-background pixel.\n4. Merge the moved non-background pixel with the next non-background pixel if they have different colors; otherwise, leave them as is.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all non-background pixels in the input sequence.",

        "object_description": "There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 has color 6, starts at index 1, ends at index 3, and has a size of 3. Object_2 has color 4, starts at index 6, ends at index 6, and has a size of 1.",
        "transformed_objects": "After applying the transformation, there will be two objects in the output sequence: Object_1 will have color 6, start at index 1, end at index 3, and have a size of 3. Object_2 will have color 4, start at index 7, end at index 7, and have a size of 1.",
