prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains an object of color 1 with a length of 5. In the output sequence, this object has been replaced with an object of color 6 with the same length (5) at the same position.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence contains an object of color 1 with a length of 4. In the output sequence, this object has been replaced with an object of color 6 with the same length (4) at the same position.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the input sequence contains two overlapping objects of color 1 with lengths of 5 and 4 respectively. In the output sequence, these objects have been replaced with objects of color 6 and 7 with the same lengths at the same positions."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence with one or more consecutive objects of color 1, replace each object with a new object of a different color (6 or 7), while preserving the original length and position of each object.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Replace each object's color value with a new color value (6 or 7).\n3. Preserve the length and position of each object during replacement.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are three objects in the input sequence: one object of color 1 with a length of 2 starting at index 3, another object of color 1 with a length of 1 starting at index 6, and a final object of color 1 with a length of 3 starting at index 7.",
        "transformed_objects": "The transformed objects will have the same lengths and positions as the original objects but with different color values: one object of color 6 with a length of 2 starting at index 3, another object of color 6 with a length of 1 starting at index 6, and a final object of color 7 with a length of 3 starting at index 7.",
