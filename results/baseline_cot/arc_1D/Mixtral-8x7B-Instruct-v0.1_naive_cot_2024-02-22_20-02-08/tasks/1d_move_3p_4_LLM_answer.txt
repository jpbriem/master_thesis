prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example\_1, the input sequence contains an object of color 3 at the beginning of the sequence followed by some noise pixels and then another instance of the same object at the end of the sequence. In the output sequence, the two instances of the object have been merged together, eliminating the noise pixels in between.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example\_2, there is an object of color 5 at the end of the sequence separated by noise pixels from the rest of the sequence. These pixels have been removed in the output sequence, merging the object with the rest of the sequence.",
        "Example_3": "In Example\_3, there is an object of color 1 near the beginning of the sequence, surrounded by noise pixels. In this case, the noise pixels have been replaced with the object's pixels, effectively moving the object to the beginning of the sequence."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence, if there are any noise pixels separating two instances of the same object (i.e., two adjacent pixels with the same nonzero value), merge those instances together by removing the noise pixels in between. If there are noise pixels surrounding an object, replace those pixels with the object's pixels, effectively moving the object to the nearest non-noise pixel(s).",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation to a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify any instances of the same object separated by noise pixels.\n2. Merge those instances together by removing the noise pixels in between.\n3. Identify any objects surrounded by noise pixels.\n4. Replace those noise pixels with the object's pixels, effectively moving the object to the nearest non-noise pixel(s).",

        "object_description": "There are two objects in the input sequence: one at positions 8 through 15 with a color of 7, and another at positions 16 through 23 with the same color. Both objects are surrounded by noise pixels.",
        "transformed_objects": "After applying the transformation, the two objects will be merged together, forming a single object spanning positions 8 through 23 with a color of 7. There will no longer be any noise pixels separating or surrounding the object.",
