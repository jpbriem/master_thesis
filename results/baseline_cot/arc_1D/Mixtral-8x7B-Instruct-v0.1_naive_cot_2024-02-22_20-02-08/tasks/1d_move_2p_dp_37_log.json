            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and test output for the given problem:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input sequence contains an object of color 3 at positions 1 to 4, followed by a noise pixel (0) and two more noise pixels (0). In the output sequence, this object has been moved to the left by one position, so it now starts at position 0.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence contains an object of color 6 at positions 0 to 4, followed by two noise pixels (0). In the output sequence, this object has been moved to the right by one position, so it now ends at position 5.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence with an object of a single color, the output sequence will contain the same object but shifted by one position to the left if the object does not include the first position, or to the right if the object does not include the last position.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\\n1. Identify the object(s) in the input sequence.\\n2. If the object does not include the first position, shift it to the left by one position.\\n3. If the object includes the first position but not the last position, shift it to the right by one position.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There is an object of color 7 in the input sequence, starting at position 0 and ending at position 3, with a size of 4.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"In the output sequence, the object of color 7 should appear starting at position -1 and ending at position 3, effectively shifting it to the right by one position.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n}\n```\nNote: I am unable to return the test\\_output in numpy array format directly here, but you can easily convert the final list to a numpy array using `np.array([0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0])`."
