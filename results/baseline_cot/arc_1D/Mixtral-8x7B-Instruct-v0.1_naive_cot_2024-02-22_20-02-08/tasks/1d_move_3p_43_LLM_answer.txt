prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and test output for the given input sequence:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input has an object (of color 8) at the beginning of the sequence, while the output moves this object to the end of the sequence.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, the input has an object (of color 4) at the end of the sequence, and the output moves it to the beginning of the sequence.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, there is no noise or other objects, so the entire sequence consists of one large object (of color 6). In this case, the output shifts the object to the right by two positions."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence consisting of noise pixels (0), single-colored objects, and possibly multiple adjacent objects of the same color, the output sequence will shift the leftmost object to the right by a specific number of positions determined by the length of the longest continuous chain of noise pixels found in the input sequence.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the leftmost object in the input.\n2. Find the longest continuous chain of noise pixels in the input.\n3. Shift the identified object to the right by the length of the longest chain of noise pixels plus one.\n4. Fill any gaps caused by shifting with noise pixels (0).",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There is one object in the input, consisting of nine consecutive non-zero elements with a value of 2.",
        "transformed_objects": "The object should appear in the output shifted to the right by three positions, maintaining its original size and color.",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
