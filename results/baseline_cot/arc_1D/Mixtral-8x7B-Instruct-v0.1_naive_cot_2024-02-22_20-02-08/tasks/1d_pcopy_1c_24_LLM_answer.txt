prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json

    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object with color 4 moves one position to the right.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the two objects with color 1 merge into a single object with color 1 at the original position of the second object.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the two objects with color 8 swap positions."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence with objects of various sizes and colors, each object moves or merges according to specific rules based on their relative positions and colors.",
    "instructions": "For each object in the input sequence, do the following:\n1. Determine the next position of the object based on its current position and color.\n2. If there is another object at the determined position, merge the two objects if they have the same color, otherwise move the current object to the next available position after the other object.\n3. Repeat steps 1-2 until all objects have been processed.",

        "object_description": "There are three objects in the input sequence: Object_1 has color 7, starts at index 2, ends at index 4, and has a size of 3; Object_2 has color 7, starts at index 6, ends at index 6, and has a size of 1; Object_3 has color 7, starts at index 11, ends at index 11, and has a size of 1.",
        "transformed_objects": "After applying the transformation instructions, the objects will look like this: Object_1 remains unchanged since it's already at the correct position; Object_2 moves to the position immediately before Object_3 (i.e., index 10), so it now starts at index 10, ends at index 10, and has a size of 1; Object_3 stays at its current position since no other object occupies its previous position.",
