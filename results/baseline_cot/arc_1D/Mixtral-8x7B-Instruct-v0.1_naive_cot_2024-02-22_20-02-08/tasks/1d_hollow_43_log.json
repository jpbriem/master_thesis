            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON format response to your request:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, object_1 (color 2) moves 2 units to the right, changing its position from [1, 2] to [3, 8].\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, object_1 (color 3) moves 1 unit to the right, changing its position from [4, 9] to [5, 6].\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence containing one continuous object, the object moves to the right by a number of units equal to half of its size.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: 1) Identify the object in the input sequence. 2) Calculate the number of units to move the object by dividing its size by 2. 3) Move the object to the right by the calculated number of units. 4) Set the original position of the object to 0.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": \"[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\",\n        \"object_description\": \"There is one object in the input sequence, which has a color of 5 and a size of 5. It starts at index 0 and ends at index 4.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"In the output sequence, the object will have a color of 5 and a size of 5. Its starting index will be 7 and its ending index will depend on the movement.\",\n        \"output\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": []\n}\n```\nNow let's calculate the transformed object's position and create the output sequence:\n\n* Starting index = Ending index - Half of the size + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3\n* Ending index = Starting index + Half of the size - 1 = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4\n\nTransformed object: {color: 5, start\\_index: 3, end\\_index: 4, size: 2}\n\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo we update the `transformation` and `test_output` sections of the JSON format response:\n```json\n\"transformation\": {\n   ...\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\"\n},\n\"test_output\": [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n```"
