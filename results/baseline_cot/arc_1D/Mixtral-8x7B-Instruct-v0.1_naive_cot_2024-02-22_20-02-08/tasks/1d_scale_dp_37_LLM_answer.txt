prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]



Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and the test output for the given input:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence has a noise pixel (value 0) at index 5, which gets replaced by the color 3 in the output sequence.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, there are three noise pixels (values 0) at indices 5, 6, and 7, which get replaced by the color 6 in the output sequence.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, there are two noise pixels (values 0) at indices 5 and 6, which get replaced by the color 1 in the output sequence."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "For any given input sequence, if an object contains noise pixels (i.e., pixels with value 0), then replace those noise pixels with the color of the adjacent object.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: 1) Identify the objects and their adjacent noise pixels. 2) Replace each noise pixel with the color of the adjacent object.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
        "object_description": "There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 with color 7 and sizes 4, and Object_2 with color 2 and size 1.",
        "transformed_objects": "Objects in the output sequence will remain the same as in the input sequence, except for the noise pixels, which will be replaced by the color of the adjacent object.",
        "output": "[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2]"
    },
    "test_output": np.array([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2])
