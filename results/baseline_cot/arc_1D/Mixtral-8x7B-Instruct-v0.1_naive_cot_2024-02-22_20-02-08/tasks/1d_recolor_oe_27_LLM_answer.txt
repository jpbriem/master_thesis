prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and test output:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input has two groups of consecutive 1's (white pixels) at positions 3-8 and 15-17, while the output replaces these groups with consecutive 8's (red pixels) and 6's (blue pixels), respectively. Thus, the white pixels were replaced by red and blue pixels.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, the input has two groups of consecutive 1's at positions 3-7 and 11-14, while the output replaces them with consecutive 6's (blue pixels) and 8's (red pixels). Therefore, the white pixels became blue and red pixels."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence with consecutive groups of identical non-zero numbers (representing white pixels), replace each group with another set of consecutive numbers (representing colored pixels) according to their order in the original sequence.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation, follow these steps: 1) Identify consecutive groups of identical non-zero numbers in the input sequence; 2) Replace each group with a new series of consecutive numbers based on their order in the input sequence, using the mapping: first group becomes 8 (red), second group becomes 6 (blue), third group becomes 7 (green), etc.; 3) Keep the background (0's) unchanged.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are three groups of consecutive white pixels: one starting at position 1 with a length of 4, another starting at position 7 with a length of 4, and the last one starting at position 15 with a length of 4.",
        "transformed_objects": "The first group will become 8 (red), the second group will become 6 (blue), and the third group will remain unchanged since it starts after the fourth group of consecutive numbers (which would correspond to 7 if present).",
        "output": "[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
