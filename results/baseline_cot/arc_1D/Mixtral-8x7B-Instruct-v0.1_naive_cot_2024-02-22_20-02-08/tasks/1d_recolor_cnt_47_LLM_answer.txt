prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains two groups of adjacent 8's (objects) that are horizontally aligned and separated by one noise pixel. In the output sequence, these two groups of 8's are replaced by two groups of adjacent 6's and 3's respectively, maintaining their horizontal alignment and separation. Additionally, the value of each group is decreased by 5.",
        "Example_2": "Similar to Example_1, but with different positions and sizes of the objects. The objects are again replaced by other numbers while preserving their relative positions."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Each object in the input sequence is replaced by another number in the output sequence, where the new number depends on the original number and its position relative to other objects. Specifically, the objects are sorted according to their starting index, then they are replaced by new numbers based on their order in the sorted sequence and their original value.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation to a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and extract their properties (start and end indices, color).\n2. Sort the objects based on their starting indices.\n3. Replace each object with a new number based on its order in the sorted sequence and its original color using the provided mapping:",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
        "object_description": "There are four objects with color 8 at the following positions: [(3, 3), (7, 9), (11, 13), (19, 21)]",
        "transformed_objects": "The transformed objects will have the following properties: [[(3, 3), 3], [(7, 9), 6], [(11, 13), 6], [(19, 21), 4]]",
        "output": "[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

}
```

Note: I assumed that you want me to provide the output as a numpy array. If this is incorrect, please let me know and I can adjust it accordingly.
