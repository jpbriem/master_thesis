prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output for the given test case:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains an object with color 6 at indices 4 and 5, while the output sequence has this object moved one index to the right (to indices 5 and 6) and replaced with color 4.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence contains an object with color 7 at indices 3 and 4, while the output sequence has this object moved two indices to the right (to indices 5 and 6) and replaced with color 8."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence with adjacent pixels of the same color forming objects, each object moves to the right by a number of positions equal to the difference between the current position of the object and the desired final position, where the desired final position is determined by the highest color value among the adjacent pixels in the object. If there are multiple objects, they move independently.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their respective color values.\n2. Determine the desired final position for each object based on the highest color value among the adjacent pixels in the object.\n3. Move each object to the right by the number of positions equal to the difference between the current position and the desired final position.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0],
        "object_description": "There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 with color 5 at indices 4 and 5, and Object_2 with color 7 at indices 5 to 8.",
        "transformed_objects": "Object_1 remains unchanged since it is already at its desired final position. Object_2 moves three positions to the right (from indices 5 to 8 to indices 8 to 11).",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7]"
    },
    "test_output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7]
}
```
Note: I am unable to return the test\_output in numpy array format as requested because I cannot create numpy arrays directly. However, you can easily convert the provided list to a numpy array using `np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7])`.
