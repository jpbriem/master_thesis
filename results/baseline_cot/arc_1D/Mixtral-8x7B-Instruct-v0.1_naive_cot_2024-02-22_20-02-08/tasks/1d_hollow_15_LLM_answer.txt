prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, object_1 (color 7) moves one position to the left if there is no noise pixel or object at the destination position.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, object_1 (color 7) moves to the leftmost position of the sequence, skipping any noise pixels or objects."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence, each maximal connected component consisting of identical non-zero numbers will move to the leftmost position in the sequence, skipping over noise pixels and other objects while preserving their internal order.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation, follow these steps:\n1. Identify all maximal connected components (i.e., objects) in the input sequence.\n2. Sort them according to their colors.\n3. Starting from the highest priority color, iterate through the objects and find the leftmost available position.\n4. Move the object to this position, updating the positions of subsequent objects accordingly.\n5. Repeat step 3 and 4 for lower priority colors.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are two objects in the input sequence: object_1 (color 4), starting at index 4 and ending at index 14, has a size of 11.",
        "transformed_objects": "In the test output sequence, both objects should appear at the beginning of the sequence, maintaining their relative order: object_1 (color 4) starts at index 0 and ends at index 5, followed by object_2 (also color 4).",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
