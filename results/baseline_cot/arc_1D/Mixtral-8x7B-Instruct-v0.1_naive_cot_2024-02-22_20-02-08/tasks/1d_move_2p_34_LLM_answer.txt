prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object's position has changed. In the input sequence, the object starts at index 7 and ends at index 10, while in the output sequence, the object starts at index 6 and ends at index 9.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the object's position has changed. In the input sequence, the object starts at index 2 and ends at index 5, while in the output sequence, the object starts at index 1 and ends at index 4."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence containing one connected object, if the object does not start at index 0, shift it to the left so that its starting index becomes 0.",
    "instructions": "1. Identify the object(s) in the input sequence. 2. If there is only one connected object, check its starting index. 3. If the starting index is greater than 0, shift the object to the left by adding zeros at the beginning of the sequence until the object's starting index becomes 0.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
        "object_description": "There is one connected object with a color value of 8, starting at index 2 and ending at index 7, with a size of 6.",
        "transformed_objects": "After shifting the object to the left, the object will still have a color value of 8, but its starting index will be 0, and its ending index will be 5, with a size of 6.",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
