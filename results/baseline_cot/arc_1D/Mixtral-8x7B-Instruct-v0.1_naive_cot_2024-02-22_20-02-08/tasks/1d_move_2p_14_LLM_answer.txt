prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response you requested:

```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object in the input sequence has been shifted one index to the right, and an additional instance of the object has been added at the beginning of the sequence.",
    "Example_2": "In Example_2, the object in the input sequence has been shifted one index to the left, and an additional instance of the object has been added at the end of the sequence.",
    "Example_3": "In Example_3, the object in the input sequence has been shifted two indices to the left, and an additional instance of the object has been added at both the beginning and the end of the sequence."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence containing a single object (i.e., a contiguous sequence of identical non-zero numbers), the output sequence will consist of the original object shifted by some number of indices to the left or right, along with the addition of one or more instances of the object at either the beginning or end of the sequence (or both).",
  "instructions": "To transform a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:
  1. Identify the location and extent of the object(s) in the input sequence.
  2. Determine the number of indices by which the object(s) should be shifted. This may involve identifying the location of the leading or trailing edge of the object(s) relative to the boundaries of the sequence.
  3. Insert any necessary copies of the object(s) at the appropriate locations in the sequence, taking care to preserve the order and spacing of existing elements.
  4. Shift the object(s) by the determined number of indices, again taking care to preserve the order and spacing of other elements in the sequence.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
    "object_description": "There is a single object consisting of 15 consecutive instances of the number 8, located between indices 2 and 16 inclusive.",
    "transformed_objects": "The object should appear once in the output sequence, starting at index 7 and extending through index 21 inclusive. There should also be an additional instance of the object at the beginning of the sequence.",
    "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]"
