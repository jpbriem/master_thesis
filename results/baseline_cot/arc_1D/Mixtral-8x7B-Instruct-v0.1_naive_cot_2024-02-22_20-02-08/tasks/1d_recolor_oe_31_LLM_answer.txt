prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response you requested:

```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains two objects of color 5, each of size 3, separated by a gap of 0's. The output sequence has the same objects, but their color has been changed to 4 and 7 respectively. The positions and sizes of the objects remain unchanged.",
    "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence contains three objects of color 5, each of size 5, separated by gaps of 0's. The output sequence has the same objects, but their color has been changed to 4 and 7 respectively. The positions and sizes of the objects remain unchanged."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "The input sequence consists of objects of the same size, made up of consecutive pixels of the same color, interspersed with gaps of 0's. The output sequence has the same objects, but their color is transformed according to a simple rule: the leftmost object is transformed to one color (say, 4), the rightmost object is transformed to another color (say, 7), and the other objects are transformed to a third color (say, 4 or 7, alternating).",
  "instructions": "To transform a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:
  1. Identify the objects in the input sequence, i.e., contiguous sequences of non-zero pixels of the same color.
  2. Assign a color to each object according to the following rule: if the object is the leftmost object, assign it color 4; if it is the rightmost object, assign it color 7; otherwise, alternate between colors 4 and 7 for each object moving from left to right.",
  3. Create the output sequence by replacing each object with the assigned color.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]",
    "object_description": "There are four objects in the input sequence: object 1 has color 5 and size 4, object 2 has color 5 and size 3, object 3 has color 5 and size 3, and object 4 has color 5 and size 5.",
