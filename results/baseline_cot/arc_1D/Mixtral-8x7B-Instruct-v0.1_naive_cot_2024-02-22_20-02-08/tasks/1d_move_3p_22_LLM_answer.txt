prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to your request:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object's position has been shifted rightwards by one index, while preserving its original size and color.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, the object's position has been shifted leftwards by one index, again preserving its original size and color.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the object's position has been shifted rightwards by four indices, maintaining its original size and color."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence containing an object (a contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels), shift the object's position either leftwards or rightwards by some number of indices, depending on whether the leading edge of the object is to the left or right of the center of the sequence, respectively. Preserve the object's original size and color during this shift.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: 1) Identify the object(s) in the input sequence, noting their positions, sizes, and colors. 2) If the object's leading edge is to the left of the center of the sequence, shift it rightwards by enough indices so that its trailing edge aligns with the center of the sequence. If the object's leading edge is already at or to the right of the center of the sequence, do nothing. 3) Create the resulting output sequence, ensuring that the object's position, size, and color remain unchanged from the input.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There is one object in the input sequence, starting at index 1, ending at index 9, having a size of 9, and consisting of pixels of color 1.",
        "transformed_objects": "The object in the output sequence should appear identical to the object in the input sequence, but potentially shifted along the sequence axis.",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"
    },
    "test_output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}
```
Explanation: In each example, we observe that the object is being shifted towards the center of the sequence. To determine the direction of the shift, we calculate the middle index of the sequence (which would be `len(sequence) // 2`). If the leading edge of the object is to the left of this middle index, then we shift the object rightwards; otherwise, if the leading edge is at or to the right of the middle index, we leave the object as is. This results in centering the object within the sequence.
