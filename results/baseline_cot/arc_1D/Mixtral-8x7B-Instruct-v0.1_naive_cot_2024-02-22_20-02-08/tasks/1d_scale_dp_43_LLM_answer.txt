prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object you requested:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains an object of color 8 at the beginning of the sequence followed by noise pixels, then an object of color 5 at the end of the sequence. In the output sequence, the object of color 8 has been extended to include the noise pixels, so that it now spans the entire sequence up until the object of color 5.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence consists entirely of an object of color 4, except for some noise pixels at the very end of the sequence and an object of color 5 at the very end. In the output sequence, the object of color 4 has been extended to include the noise pixels, so that it now spans the entire sequence up until the object of color 5."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence containing one or more objects separated by noise pixels, extend each object to include all adjacent noise pixels, up until the next object or the end of the sequence.",
    "instructions": "To transform a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their respective positions and sizes.\n2. Starting from the leftmost object, iterate through the input sequence, extending each object to include any adjacent noise pixels until reaching the next object or the end of the sequence.\n3. Repeat this process for each object in the input sequence.\n4. Return the resulting output sequence.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5],
        "object_description": "There are two objects in the input sequence: a object of color 2 spanning indices 2 through 11 (inclusive), and a object of color 5 at index 14.",
        "transformed_objects": "The object of color 2 will span indices 1 through 11 (inclusive) after transformation, while the object of color 5 will remain unchanged.",
