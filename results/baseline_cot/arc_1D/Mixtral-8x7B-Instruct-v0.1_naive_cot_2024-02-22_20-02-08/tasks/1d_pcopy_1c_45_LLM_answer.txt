prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and the test output for the given input:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input has an isolated group of three 9's at the beginning, while the output moves this group so it is adjacent to another group of three 9's towards the end.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input has two separate groups of three 9's, while the output merges these groups together.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the input has a single group of three consecutive 1's separated by zeros, while the output moves one 1 to form a group of three consecutive 1's at the end."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence where some non-zero numbers (other than 9) appear in isolated groups, the output sequence modifies these groups so they are either moved or merged together.",
    "instructions": "For each isolated group of non-zero numbers other than 9, find the closest group of three consecutive 9's towards the right side of the input sequence. If there is no such group, leave the current group unchanged. Otherwise, merge the two groups if their combined size is greater than three, otherwise move the current group to the location of the group of three consecutive 9's.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are four isolated groups of 5's, each of size three.",
        "transformed_objects": "The first and third groups will be merged with the nearest group of three consecutive 9's, while the second and fourth groups will remain unchanged.",
        "output": "[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
