            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and test output for the given task:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the single object (of color 3) in the input sequence has been shifted right by two positions.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"Similarly, in Example_2, the single object (of color 6) in the input sequence has been shifted right by one position.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"For Example_3, the single object (of color 1) in the input sequence has been shifted left by two positions.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence with one continuous object, shift it either to the left or right while ensuring that the relative order of noise pixels and the object's color remains unchanged.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To apply the transformation, find the starting index of the non-zero object. If there exists a single object, check if shifting it to the left or right would result in a valid output. Shift the object accordingly, maintaining the relative order of noise pixels and the object's color.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There is a single object with color 7, having a size of 4, starting at index 0, and ending at index 3.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"The object will remain intact but may change its position according to the applied transformation rule.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n}\n```\nNote: In the `output` field under `transformation`, I provided the expected output as a Python list instead of a NumPy array since JSON does not support direct representation of NumPy arrays. To convert this list to a NumPy array, you can simply call `numpy.array(<list>)`."
