prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output for the given test case:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, adjacent pixels of the same color (objects) in the input sequence were moved together towards the right side of the sequence, merged with any existing pixels of the same color at their destination, and had their color spread to fill any gaps caused by merging. This resulted in contiguous blocks of identical color pixels in the output sequence.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, the green pixels (color 7) were moved towards the right side of the sequence, merged with any existing pixels of the same color at their destination, and had their color spread to fill any gaps caused by merging. However, in this case, there was already an isolated block of green pixels on the right side of the input sequence, so those pixels remained in place while the other green pixels were merged and spread."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence of pixels, where each contiguous group of non-background pixels forms an object, the output sequence is generated by moving each object towards the right side of the sequence, merging it with any existing pixels of the same color at its destination, and spreading its color to fill any gaps caused by merging. If multiple objects of the same color exist in the input sequence, they will be merged and spread separately, but if an object overlaps with an existing block of pixels of the same color at its destination, it will merge with and spread into that block.",
    "instructions": "To generate the output sequence from an input sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify each contiguous group of non-background pixels in the input sequence as an object.\n2. Sort the objects by their color value, in ascending order.\n3. For each object, starting with the leftmost one:\n   a. Determine the index of the rightmost pixel of the object.\n   b. Starting from that index, search for the next occurrence of the object's color value to the right of the current object.\n   c. Merge the current object with any pixels of the same color found during the search, and spread its color to fill any gaps caused by merging.\n   d. Repeat steps 3a-c for each subsequent object, until all objects have been processed.",

        "object_description": "There are three objects in the input sequence: a red object (color 6) consisting of three pixels at indices 1-3, a blue object (color 5) consisting of two pixels at indices 8-9, and a green object (color 7) consisting of a single pixel at index 21.",
        "transformed_objects": "After processing all objects, the output sequence will consist of four contiguous blocks of pixels: a red block (color 6) consisting of five pixels at indices 1-5, a blue block (color 5) consisting of six pixels at indices 8-13, a second red block (color 6) consisting of seven pixels at indices 15-21, and a green block (color 7) consisting of eight pixels at indices 22-29.",
