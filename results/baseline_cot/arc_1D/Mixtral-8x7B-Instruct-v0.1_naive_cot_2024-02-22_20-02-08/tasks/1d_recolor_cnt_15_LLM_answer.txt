prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given problem:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains two objects of color 7, each having a size of 3. In the output sequence, these objects are replaced by objects of color 8 (first object) and color 5 (second object), both having a size of 2. Additionally, there is an extra pixel of color 9 inserted at the beginning of the second object.",
        "Example_2": "Similar to Example_1, but the order of the objects is reversed, and the replacement objects are of different sizes."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "For every pair of adjacent objects of the same color in the input sequence, replace them with two new objects of possibly different colors in the output sequence. The new objects may also differ in their sizes and positions compared to the original objects. Insert additional noise pixels before or after the newly formed objects if necessary.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation to a new input sequence, follow these steps:<br>1. Identify pairs of adjacent objects of the same color.<br>2. Replace each identified pair with two new objects according to some rule.<br>3. Optionally insert noise pixels before or after the newly formed objects.<br>",
