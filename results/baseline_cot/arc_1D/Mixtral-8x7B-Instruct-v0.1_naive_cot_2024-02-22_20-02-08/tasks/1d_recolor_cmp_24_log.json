            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON format response to the given problem:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the object with color 9 in the input sequence has been replaced by an object with color 2 in the output sequence at the same position, maintaining the same size.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, the object with color 9 in the input sequence has been replaced by an object with color 2 in the output sequence at the same position, but with reduced size.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"In Example_3, the object with color 9 in the input sequence has been replaced by an object with color 2 in the output sequence at the same position, but with reduced size.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence containing one or more consecutive objects with color 9, each object will be replaced by another object with color 2 in the output sequence at the same position, possibly with a smaller size.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: (1) Identify all consecutive objects with color 9 in the input sequence; (2) Replace each identified object with a new object having color 2 at the same position while adjusting its size according to the rule: if the original object's size is greater than or equal to 5, keep it unchanged; otherwise, reduce its size so that it becomes half of its original size.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There are two objects with color 9 in the input sequence, both starting at index 1 and ending at indices 3, 7, and 16 respectively, with sizes of 3, 7, and 3.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"In the output sequence, there will be two objects with color 2 replacing the original objects with color 9, where the first object starts at index 1 and ends at index 3 with a size of 3, and the second object starts at index 7 and ends at index 8 with a size of 4.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n}\n```"
