prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and test output:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input has a long sequence of consecutive 2's at the beginning, followed by some noise pixels (0's) at the end. In the output, these initial 2's were moved towards the right side of the sequence, preserving their order but removing the leading zeros.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, there was a sequence of consecutive 1's surrounded by noise pixels. These 1's were moved together towards the right side of the sequence, maintaining their relative positions while eliminating the leading zeros.",
        "Example_3": "For Example_3, we had a sequence of consecutive 5's separated by noise pixels. Again, the non-zero elements were shifted towards the right side of the sequence, keeping their internal structure intact."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence consisting of one or more consecutive non-zero pixels (objects), followed by any number of noise pixels (zeros), the task requires moving the objects towards the right side of the sequence without changing their internal arrangement.",
    "instructions": "To apply this transformation to a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the starting index of the first non-zero element.\n2. Find the ending index of the last non-zero element.\n3. Create a new empty sequence of the same length.\n4. Copy the identified sub-sequence (step 2) to the new sequence, starting from the second element.\n5. Set the first element of the new sequence to 0.\n6. Return the newly created sequence.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": "[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
        "object_description": "There is a single object in the input sequence, consisting of five consecutive 2's, located at indices 1 through 5.",
        "transformed_objects": "The object will remain unchanged in terms of its internal structure; however, it will appear in the output sequence starting from index 1.",
        "output": "[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
