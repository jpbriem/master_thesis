            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output for the given task:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the leftmost and rightmost 8's were moved to the second last and last positions respectively.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"Similarly, in Example_2, the leftmost 2 was moved to the third position from the left.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"In Example_3, the middle three 4's were swapped, i.e., the first two 4's were moved one position to the right.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence, if there exists a single contiguous block of non-zero pixels (i.e., an object), then it is shifted towards the center of the sequence while preserving its relative order and spacing between pixels.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To apply the transformation to a new input sequence, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Identify the position(s) of the contiguous block(s) of non-zero pixels.\\n2. If there is more than one block, choose the largest one.\\n3. Calculate the center position of the chosen block.\\n4. Move each pixel in the block toward the calculated center position, maintaining its relative position and spacing with other pixels in the block.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There is a single contiguous block of five non-zero pixels with value 2, starting at index 5 and ending at index 9, having a total size of 5.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"The block of 2's will be moved towards the center of the sequence, i.e., the fourth position from the left.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n}\n```\nNote: In the `test_output` field, I assumed you wanted the actual NumPy array representation instead of a string."
