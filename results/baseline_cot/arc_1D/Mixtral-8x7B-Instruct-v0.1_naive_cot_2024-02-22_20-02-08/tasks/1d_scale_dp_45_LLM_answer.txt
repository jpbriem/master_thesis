prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object you requested:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, a single object of color 1 appears in the input sequence. In the output sequence, this object has been extended by three units to the right.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, an isolated object of color 1 appears in the input sequence. In the output sequence, this object has been extended by three units to the right.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, an object of color 6 spans the entire input sequence. In the output sequence, this object remains unchanged."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence containing one or more contiguous objects, extend each object to the right by a fixed number of units (three, in these examples). If an object already extends to the end of the sequence, leave it unchanged.",
    "instructions": "To transform a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, perform the following steps:\n1. Identify all contiguous objects in the input sequence.\n2. For each object, determine its current length and calculate the index of the final element plus four (to account for extending the object by three units).\n3. Replace the original object with a new object of the same color and length equal to the calculated index.\n4. Leave any noise pixels (i.e., non-object pixels) unchanged.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are two objects in the input sequence: a block of four consecutive pixels with value 5, followed by a single pixel with value 9.",
        "transformed_objects": "In the output sequence, the block of four consecutive pixels with value 5 will be extended by three units to the right, becoming a block of seven consecutive pixels with value 5. The pixel with value 9 will remain unchanged.",
        "output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
