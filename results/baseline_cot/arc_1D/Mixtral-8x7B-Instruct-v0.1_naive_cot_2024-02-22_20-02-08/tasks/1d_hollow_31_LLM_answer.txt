prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response you requested:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object with color 6 in the input sequence has been split into two separate objects in the output sequence. The first object has a size of 1 and starts at index 7, while the second object has a size of 15 and starts at index 18.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the object with color 3 in the input sequence has been split into two separate objects in the output sequence. The first object has a size of 1 and starts at index 5, while the second object has a size of 15 and starts at index 20."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The input sequence contains one long object, and the output sequence splits this object into two smaller objects, where the first object starts at the beginning of the original object and ends at some index k, and the second object starts at index k+1 and ends at the end of the original object.",
    "instructions": "To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, find the index k that splits the long object into two parts of sizes n and m, respectively. Set the value of the (k+1)th element to 0, then set the values of elements from k+2 to k+n to the color of the long object. Finally, set the values of elements from k+n+1 to the end of the sequence to the color of the long object.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There is one object in the input sequence, with color 4, starting at index 2, ending at index 27, and having a size of 26.",
        "transformed_objects": "There will be two objects in the output sequence, both with color 4. The first object will start at index 2, end at index k, and have a size of n. The second object will start at index k+1, end at index 27, and have a size of m.",
        "output": []
    },
    "test_output": []
}
```

Note that I left the `output` and `test_output` fields empty because they depend on the specific value of `k`, which is not provided in the problem statement. To compute these fields, you would need to implement the instructions given in the `instructions` field.
