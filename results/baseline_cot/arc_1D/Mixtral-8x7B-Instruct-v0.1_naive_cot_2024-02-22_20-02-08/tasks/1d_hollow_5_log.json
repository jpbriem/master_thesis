            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n {'description': {'Example\\_1': 'In Example\\_1, the object with color 4 in the input sequence has been split into two separate objects in the output sequence, both with the same color but with one less pixel each.',\n   'Example\\_2': 'In Example\\_2, the object with color 6 in the input sequence has been shifted to the right by two indices, leaving a gap of two zeros between the original position and the new position.',\n   'Example\\_3': 'In Example\\_3, the object with color 8 in the input sequence has been shifted to the right by three indices, and an additional pixel with value 0 has been added at the previous position of the object.'},\n  'overall\\_pattern': 'Given an input sequence with objects of various sizes and colors, the output sequence will have the same objects but possibly modified positions and potentially separated into smaller objects.',\n  'instructions': 'To transform a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these steps:\\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties (start index, end index, color).\\n2. Modify the objects according to the following rules: \\n   - If there are noise pixels (i.e., non-zero pixels) before or after the object, shift the object to the right by the number of noise pixels.\\n   - After shifting the object, if there are any remaining noise pixels between the original and new positions, insert a new object with the same color and size as the original object at the position of the first noise pixel encountered.\\n3.
