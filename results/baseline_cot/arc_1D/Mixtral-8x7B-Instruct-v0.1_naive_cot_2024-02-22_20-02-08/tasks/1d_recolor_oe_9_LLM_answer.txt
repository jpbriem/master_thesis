prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and the test output for the given input sequence:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains two large groups of 9's separated by zeros. In the output sequence, these groups of 9's are replaced by smaller groups of 1's and 7's, maintaining the same positions and sizes.",
        "Example_2": "Similar to Example_1, but with larger groups of 9's. The output sequence has larger groups of 1's and 7's at the same positions and sizes.",
        "Example_3": "In this example, the input sequence consists of several groups of 9's interspersed with zeros. The output sequence replaces each group of 9's with another number (either 1 or 7), preserving their positions and sizes."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence consisting of groups of identical numbers separated by zeros, replace each group with one or more other numbers while preserving their positions and sizes.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation, follow these steps: 1) Identify consecutive groups of identical numbers in the input sequence. 2) Replace each group with a new set of numbers, ensuring that the new group maintains the original group's position and size. Use different numbers for adjacent groups.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are three main groups of 9's in the input sequence, along with some leading and trailing zeros.",
        "transformed_objects": "Replace the leftmost group of 9's with a group of 5's, the middle group with a group of 6's, and the rightmost group with a group of 8's.",
        "output": [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
