prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, adjacent equal colored pixels (objects) in the input were merged together, making them consecutive without gaps.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, adjacent equal colored pixels (objects) in the input were merged together, filling the gaps between them."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence where equal colored pixels appear adjacent but separated by gaps, merge these adjacent equal colored pixels so they become consecutive.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, iterate through the input sequence while keeping track of the current object's color and position. If you encounter another pixel of the same color, update the end index of the current object; otherwise, add the current object to the output sequence and reset the object's properties.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are three objects in this input sequence: Object_1 has a color of 1, starts at index 1, ends at index 2, and has a size of 2; Object_2 has a color of 1, starts at index 5, ends at index 6, and has a size of 2; Object_3 has a color of 1, starts at index 9, ends at index 10, and has a size of 2.",
        "transformed_objects": "After applying the merging rule, there will be no gaps between the equal colored pixels, meaning each object will have consecutive indices. In other words, Object_1 will have a size of 3, Object_2 will have a size of 3, and Object_3 will have a size of 3.",
        "output": "[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
