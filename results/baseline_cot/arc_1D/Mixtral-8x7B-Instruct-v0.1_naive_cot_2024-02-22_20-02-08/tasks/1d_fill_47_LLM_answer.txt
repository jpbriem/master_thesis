prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 {'description': {'Example\_1': 'In Example\_1, the object with color 3 in the input sequence has been filled, meaning it has replaced the background (0) pixels adjacent to it in the output sequence.',
   'Example\_2': 'Similarly, in Example\_2, the object with color 3 in the input sequence has been filled, replacing the background (0) pixels adjacent to it in the output sequence.',
   'Example\_3': 'In Example\_3, the object with color 8 in the input sequence has been filled, replacing the background (0) pixels adjacent to it in the output sequence.'},
  'overall\_pattern': 'Given an input sequence, if there exists an object (non-background pixels), then replace the background (0) pixels adjacent to this object with the object\'s color in the output sequence.',
  'instructions': 'Step 1: Identify any objects (non-background pixels) present in the input sequence.\n'
                  'Step 2: If an object is found, iterate through each index of the input sequence.\n'
                  'Step 3: If the current index contains a background (0) pixel and is adjacent to the identified object, replace it with the object\'s color in the output sequence.',
  'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
                     'object\_description': 'There are two objects with color 5, both having a size of 2 and positioned at indices 3 and 6.',
                     'transformed\_objects': 'The objects will remain the same but will fill the background (0) pixels adjacent to them in the output sequence.',
                     'output': '[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]'},
