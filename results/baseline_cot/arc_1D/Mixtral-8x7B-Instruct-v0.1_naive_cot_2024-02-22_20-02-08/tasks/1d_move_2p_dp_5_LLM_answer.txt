prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the second object (with color 2) was extended by one pixel to the left.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the first object (with color 3) was extended by two pixels to the right.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the second object (with color 4) was replaced with the third object (with color 5), maintaining its position."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence with two non-background objects, the second object will either be shifted or replaced by the third object.",
    "instructions": "To transform the input into the output, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the second and third objects.\n2. If the second object has a larger size than the third object, shift the second object towards the first object until it reaches the beginning or end of the first object.\n3. Otherwise, replace the second object with the third object, preserving the position of the third object.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are three objects: \n- Object 1: Color=2, Start Index=10, End Index=12, Size=3\n- Object 2: Color=5, Start Index=17, End Index=17, Size=1",
        "transformed_objects": "After applying the transformation, the objects will appear as follows:\n- Object 1: Color=2, Start Index=10, End Index=12, Size=3\n- Object 2: Color=5, Start Index=16, End Index=16, Size=1",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
    },
    "test_output": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
Note: In the `transformation` section, I've provided the expected output as a string; however, you can convert this string to a NumPy array if required.
