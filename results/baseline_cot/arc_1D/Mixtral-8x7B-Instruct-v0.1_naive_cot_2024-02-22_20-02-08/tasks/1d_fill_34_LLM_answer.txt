prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response describing the transformation pattern and instructions to convert the given input sequence to its corresponding output sequence:

```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object with color 5 moved one index to the right and filled any gaps between itself and other instances of the same color.",
    "Example_2": "Similar to Example_1, the object with color 7 moved one index to the right and filled any gaps between itself and other instances of the same color.",
    "Example_3": "In Example_3, the object with color 2 expanded to occupy all available indices between its two occurrences."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence containing objects (consecutive non-zero elements) separated by noise pixels (zeros), each object expands to occupy all available indices between its two outermost positions while maintaining its original order.",
  "instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the objects and their positions.\n2. For each object, find its leftmost and rightmost indices.\n3. Replace all noise pixels between the leftmost and rightmost indices with the object's color.\n4. Preserve the original object's color and position.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": "[7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
    "object_description": "There are two objects in this input sequence: Object_1 has a color of 7 and spans indices 0 to 1; Object_2 has a color of 7 and spans indices 4 to 4.",
    "transformed_objects": "After applying the transformation, Object_1 will span indices 0 to 6, and Object_2 will remain at indices 4 to 4 since it already occupies all available indices between its two outermost positions.",
    "output": "[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
  },
  "test_output": [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
