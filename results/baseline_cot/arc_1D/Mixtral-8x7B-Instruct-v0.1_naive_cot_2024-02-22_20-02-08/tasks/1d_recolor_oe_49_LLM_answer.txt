prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains two groups of 6's separated by zeros. In the output sequence, these groups of 6's are replaced by groups of 3's and 9's, where the left group becomes 3's and the right group becomes 9's.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the input sequence contains one group of 6's at the beginning and three groups of 6's separated by zeros. In the output sequence, these groups of 6's are replaced by groups of 3's and 9's, where the first group becomes 9's and the other three groups become 3's.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the input sequence contains two groups of 6's separated by zeros, where the second group has a single 6 at the beginning. In the output sequence, these groups of 6's are replaced by groups of 3's and 9's, where the left group becomes 9's and the right group becomes 3's."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The overall pattern involves replacing each group of consecutive 6's (objects) with two groups of consecutive numbers, where the number of elements in each group depends on the length of the original group. If the group of 6's starts at an even index, it will be replaced by a group of 3's followed by a group of 9's. Otherwise, if the group of 6's starts at an odd index, it will be replaced by a group of 9's followed by a group of 3's.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: 1) Identify each contiguous group of 6's in the input sequence and record their starting indices. 2) Replace each group of 6's with a group of 3's and 9's depending on whether the starting index is even or odd. Specifically, if the starting index is even, replace the group of 6's with a group of 3's of equal length followed by a group of 9's of equal length. If the starting index is odd, replace the group of 6's with a group of 9's of equal length followed by a group of 3's of equal length.",
