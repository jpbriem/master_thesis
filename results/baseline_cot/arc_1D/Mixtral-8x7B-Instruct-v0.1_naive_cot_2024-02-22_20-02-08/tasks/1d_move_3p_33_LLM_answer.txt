prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and test output:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input has a consecutive sequence of 8 blue pixels (color 2) at the center, while the output shifts this sequence towards the left by one position. This means that each pixel moves one position to the left, wrapping around the edges.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, the input has a consecutive sequence of 15 red pixels (color 6) at the center, and the output shifts it towards the right by two positions. Each pixel moves two positions to the right, again wrapping around the edges.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, there is no central sequence of pixels to shift. Instead, the three zeros before the sixes are moved after them, effectively swapping their order."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence, if there exists a contiguous block of non-zero pixels, then every pixel in the sequence will move either left or right by a number of positions equal to the length of the block minus one. If there is no such block, then any group of zeros adjacent to the block of non-zero pixels will swap places with the block's leading elements.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation, follow these steps:\n1. Find the longest contiguous block of non-zero pixels.\n2. Determine whether the block is located more towards the left or right half of the sequence.\n3. Move every pixel in the sequence by a number of positions equal to the length of the block minus one, either to the left or right depending on the location found in step 2.\n4. If there is no such block, find the closest group of zeros adjacent to the block of non-zero pixels and swap their positions with the leading elements of the block.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There is a single object consisting of nine 3's starting at index 0 and ending at index 8.",
        "transformed_objects": "The object should remain unchanged in terms of size and color but may change in position. Specifically, since the object is located towards the left half of the sequence, we expect it to move towards the right by eight positions, wrapping around the edges.",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]"
