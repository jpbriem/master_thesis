            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON format response you requested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the color of the objects has changed from 4 to 9 at the beginning and end of each object, while the color of the objects has changed from 4 to 8 in the middle of each object.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, the color of the objects has changed from 4 to 8 at the beginning and end of each object, while the color of the objects has changed from 4 to 9 in the middle of each object.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"For each pair of adjacent objects, if they are separated by noise pixels (i.e., 0's), then change the color of the first object to a specific value A and the second object to a specific value B. If there is no separation between two adjacent objects, then change the color of both objects to another specific value C. All other pixels remain unchanged.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: 1) Identify the objects and their adjacency relationships. 2) Change the color of each object according to the overall pattern specified above.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There are three objects in this input sequence: Object_1 has a color of 4, starts at index 1, ends at index 3, and has a size of 3; Object_2 has a color of 4, starts at index 6, ends at index 8, and has a size of 3; Object_3 has a color of 4, starts at index 15, ends at index 17, and has a size of 3.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"In the transformed output sequence, Object_1 will have a color of A, Object_2 will have a color of B, and Object_3 will have a color of C.\",\n        \"output\": []\n    },\n    \"test_output\": []\n}\n```\n\nNote that I left the `output` and `test_output` arrays empty because I don't know what specific values A, B, and C should be. However, based on the given examples, we can assume that A = 9, B = 8, and C = 8 when the original object color is 4. Therefore, the `output` and `test_output` arrays would be:\n\n```json\n\"output\": [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\"test_output\": [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```"
