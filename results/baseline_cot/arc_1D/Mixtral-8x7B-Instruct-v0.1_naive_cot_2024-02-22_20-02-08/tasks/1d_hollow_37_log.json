            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and the test output for the given input:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input has a single horizontal object of color 1 at the beginning of the sequence. In the output, this object remains but has been shifted one unit to the right while leaving a gap (0) behind it.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"Similar to Example_1, the input has a single horizontal object of color 5 occupying the entire sequence. In the output, this object remains but has been shifted two units to the left while leaving gaps (0) behind it.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence with consecutive pixels of some color forming an object, shift the object towards the center of the sequence by introducing noise pixels (0's) while preserving the original object's color and structure.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To apply the transformation, follow these steps: \\n1. Identify the starting index and ending index of the object in the input sequence.\\n2. Calculate the desired offset for shifting the object towards the center.\\n3. Insert noise pixels (0's) at appropriate positions to create space for shifting the object.\\n4. Shift the object towards the calculated offset without changing its internal structure.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There is a single horizontal object of color 7 spanning from index 3 to index 6 in the input sequence.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"The object will remain unchanged in terms of color and structure; however, it will be shifted towards the center of the sequence due to the introduction of noise pixels.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0])\n}\n```"
