prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object you requested:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object with color 8 moved one index to the left.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the object with color 4 moved two indices to the left.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, the object with color 6 did not move."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence with a single object (excluding noise) and a 1 at the end, the object moves to the left until it reaches the beginning of the sequence or encounters another object. If there are multiple objects in the input sequence, each object moves independently according to this rule.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation to a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify all objects in the input sequence.\n2. For each object, find the nearest index to its left that either contains a non-zero value or is out of bounds.\n3. Move the object to the index found in step 2.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all objects.\n5. Add a 1 at the rightmost index of the sequence if it does not already exist.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0],
        "object_description": "There is one object with color 2, starting at index 2 and ending at index 11, with a size of 10.",
        "transformed_objects": "The object with color 2 will move to the left, starting at index 1 and ending at index 10, with a size of 10.",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0]"
    },
    "test_output": [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0]
}
