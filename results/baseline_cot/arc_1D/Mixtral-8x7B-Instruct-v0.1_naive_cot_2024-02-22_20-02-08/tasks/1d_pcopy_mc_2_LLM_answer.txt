prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the object with color 5 in the input sequence moves to the right by one index and overlaps with the object with color 6, while maintaining its size and color. Additionally, the object with color 6 in the input sequence expands to the left by two indices, maintaining its color.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the object with color 5 in the input sequence maintains its position and size but changes its color to match the color of the next non-zero object (color 3) to its right. Similarly, the object with color 3 expands to the left by three indices, maintaining its color. Lastly, the object with color 4 in the input sequence expands to the right by three indices, maintaining its color."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence, each non-zero object moves to the right until it reaches another non-zero object or the end of the sequence, expanding and merging with any consecutive non-zero objects of the same color. If there are no consecutive non-zero objects of the same color to merge with, the object maintains its original color. Non-zero objects may also change their color to match the color of the next non-zero object to their right if they do not expand.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output sequence, follow these steps:\n1. Iterate through the input sequence from left to right.\n2. For each non-zero object, find the next non-zero object of the same color to its right.\n3. Move the current object to the right by the number of indices between its current position and the position of the next non-zero object found in step 2.\n4. Expand the current object to include any consecutive non-zero objects of the same color merged during the movement in step 3.\n5. Change the color of the current object to match the color of the next non-zero object to its right if it did not expand in step 4.\n6. Repeat steps 1-5 for all non-zero objects in the input sequence.",

        "object_description": "There are two main objects in the input sequence: one with color 5, starting at index 1, ending at index 3, and having a size of 3; and another with color 6, starting at index 7, ending at index 7, and having a size of 1.",
        "transformed_objects": "The object with color 5 will move to the right by six indices, merging with any consecutive non-zero objects of the same color along the way. It will maintain its color. The object with color 6 will expand to the left by six indices, maintaining its color.",
