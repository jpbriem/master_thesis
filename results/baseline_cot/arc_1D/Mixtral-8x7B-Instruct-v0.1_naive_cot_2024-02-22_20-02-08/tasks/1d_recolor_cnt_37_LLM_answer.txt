prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 7, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response describing the transformation pattern and instructions to convert the given input sequence to its corresponding output sequence:

```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "In Example_1, object_1 (of color 4) moves one index to the right, changes its color to 2, and increases its size by 1. Object_2 (also of color 4) moves two indices to the right, changes its color to 7, and increases its size by 1.",
    "Example_2": "In Example_2, object_1 (of color 4) moves one index to the left, changes its color to 9, and increases its size by 1. Object_2 (also of color 4) moves three indices to the right, changes its color to 2, and decreases its size by 1.",
    "Example_3": "In Example_3, object_1 (of color 4) moves four indices to the right, changes its color to 7, and increases its size by 1. Object_2 (also of color 4) moves six indices to the right, changes its color to 2, and decreases its size by 1."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Each object moves according to its starting position, changing its color and increasing or decreasing its size based on its original size and position. If an object starts at an even index, it will change its color to 7 and increase its size by 1. Otherwise, if an object starts at an odd index, it will change its color to 2 and decrease its size by 1.",
  "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: 1) Identify each object's starting position, ending position, and color. 2) Determine whether each object starts at an even or odd index. 3) Apply the appropriate color change and size adjustments based on the object's starting position. 4) Shift the position of each object according to its starting position.",
  "transformation": {
    "input": [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],
    "object_description": "There are two objects in this input sequence: Object_1 has a color of 4, a start index of 3, an end index of 5, and a size of 3; Object_2 has a color of 4, a start index of 9, an end index of 11, and a size of 3.",
    "transformed_objects": "Object_1 will have a color of 7, a start index of 6, an end index of 8, and a size of 3; Object_2 will have a color of 2, a start index of 13, an end index of 13, and a size of 1.",
