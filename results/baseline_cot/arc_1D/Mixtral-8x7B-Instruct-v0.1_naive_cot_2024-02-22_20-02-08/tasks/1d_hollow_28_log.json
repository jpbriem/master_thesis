            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation steps, and test output for the given problem:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the middle pixel (5) of the single object moves one index to the right.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, the second and third pixels of the single object become noise pixels (0).\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"In Example_3, the fourth and fifth pixels of the single object move one index to the left.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"For each continuous group of non-zero pixels, if there exists at least two adjacent non-zero pixels, then either the first or last pixel of the group becomes a noise pixel (0), otherwise, the middle pixel of the group moves one index towards the side where there is no noise pixel.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"1. Identify each continuous group of non-zero pixels.\\n2. Check if there exist at least two adjacent non-zero pixels in the group.\\n3. If yes, randomly choose one of the first or last pixel of the group and change it to a noise pixel (0).\\n4. Otherwise, find the middle pixel of the group and move it one index towards the side where there is no noise pixel.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There is a single object consisting of five consecutive pixels with value 7, starting from index 0 and ending at index 4.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"The middle pixel of the object will move one index to the right, becoming a pixel with value 7 at index 5.\",\n        \"output\": \"[7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": np.array([7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0])\n}\n```\nNote: In the `transformation` section, I assumed that when you said \"middle pixel,\" you meant the middle pixel among the non-noise pixels. This means that if the number of non-zero pixels is even, the pixel moved would be the one closest to the center."
