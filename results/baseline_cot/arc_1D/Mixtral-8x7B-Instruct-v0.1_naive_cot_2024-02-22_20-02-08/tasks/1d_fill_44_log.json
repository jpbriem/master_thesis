            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output for the given test case:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the object with color 2 moves one position to the left.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, the object with color 4 moves two positions to the left.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"In Example_3, the object with color 7 grows by one position to the right.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence with at most one object (consecutive non-zero pixels) per color, the output sequence is obtained by moving the object's starting position to the left by a number of positions equal to half of its size, rounded down. If the object consists of an odd number of pixels, it will remain centered around the original position.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\\n1. Identify the color and position of each object in the input.\\n2. Calculate the number of positions to shift the object to the left as half of its size, rounded down.\\n3. Shift the object to the left by the calculated number of positions.\\n4. Set the value of any noise pixels (0) to their original value in the input.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There are two objects in the input sequence: object 1 has color 3, starts at index 4, ends at index 5, and has a size of 2; object 2 has color 3, starts at index 8, ends at index 9, and has a size of 2.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"After shifting both objects to the left by one position (rounded down), object 1 will have color 3, start at index 3, end at index 4, and have a size of 2; object 2 will have color 3, start at index 7, end at index 8, and have a size of 2.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n}\n```"
