prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given problem:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, object_1 (color 3) moved one index to the left.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, object_1 (color 2) moved two indices to the right.",
        "Example_3": "In Example_3, there was no change since the object was already at the beginning."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "If an object exists at the beginning of the sequence, leave it unchanged; otherwise, shift the object one index to the left.",
    "instructions": "1. Check if the first element of the sequence is non-zero (i.e., contains an object). If yes, proceed to step 2; else, return the original sequence.\n2. Iterate through the elements of the sequence starting from the second element until you find the first non-zero value.\n3. Move the found object one index to the left.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There is one object in this sequence - object_1 with color 4, starting at index 0, ending at index 2, and having a size of 3.",
        "transformed_objects": "After applying the transformation, object_1 will still have the same properties but shifted one index to the left.",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]"
    },
    "test_output": [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]
