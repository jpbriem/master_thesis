            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON format response to your request:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, object_1 (color=3) moves one index to the left.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, object_1 (color=3) moves three indices to the left.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence with two non-background objects, where object_1 appears before object_2, object_1 will move to the left by a number of positions equal to the size of object_2.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To apply the transformation to a new input sequence, follow these steps:\\n1. Identify the two non-background objects.\\n2. Determine the size of the second object.\\n3. Move the first object to the left by the size of the second object.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n        \"object_description\": \"There are two non-background objects: object_1 (color=3) has a size of 3 and starts at index 2; object_2 (color=2) has a size of 1 and starts at index 10.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"After applying the transformation, object_1 (color=3) will have a size of 3 and start at index -1 (effectively moved out of the sequence). Object_2 remains unchanged.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* In this problem, we need to identify the movement of the first object based on the size of the second object.\n* We can see that in both examples, the first object moves to the left by the size of the second object.\n* To create the test output, I identified the two non-background objects and applied the overall pattern to them."
