prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response you requested:

```json
{
  "description": {
    "Example_1": "In Example_1, object colors in the input sequence were shifted up by 1 and then mirrored around the center of each group of objects. Specifically, the leftmost object of color 2 became an object of color 3, and the rightmost object of color 2 became an object of color 1.",
    "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, object colors in the input sequence were shifted down by 5 and then mirrored around the center of each group of objects. Specifically, the leftmost object of color 2 became an object of color 7 (which was outside the range of valid colors but could be interpreted as noise), and the rightmost object of color 2 became an object of color 3."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "For any given input sequence, objects consisting of adjacent pixels of the same non-zero color are identified. Each object's color is shifted up or down by some constant value, and then the modified objects are mirrored around their centers. If an object's new color falls outside the range of valid colors (1-9), it can be interpreted as noise (0).",
  "instructions": "To transform a new input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps: 1) Identify all objects in the input sequence, noting their positions, sizes, and colors. 2) Shift each object's color up or down by some constant value. 3) Mirror each object around its center. 4) Replace any out-of-range colors with noise (0).",

    "input": [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    "object_description": "There are three objects in this input sequence: one object of color 2 at positions 2-3 and 26-27, one object of color 2 at positions 5-7, and one object of color 2 at positions 12-14 and 18-19.",
    "transformed_objects": "In the output sequence, we expect to see three objects: one object of color 4 at positions 2-3 and 26-27, one object of color 0 (interpreted as noise) at positions 5-7, and one object of color 6 at positions 12-14 and 18-19.",
