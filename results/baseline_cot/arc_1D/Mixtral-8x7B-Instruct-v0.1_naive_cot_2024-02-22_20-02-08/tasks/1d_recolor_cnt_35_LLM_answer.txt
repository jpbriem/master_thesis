prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format response to the given task:

```json

    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input sequence contains objects with color 2, while the output sequence has objects with color 1, 4, and 5. Each object's position remains the same, but their sizes change according to their order in the sequence.",
        "Example_2": "Similar to Example_1, the input sequence contains objects with color 2, while the output sequence has objects with color 1, 4, and 5. Again, each object's position remains the same, but their sizes change according to their order in the sequence."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence containing objects with color 2, the output sequence will have objects with color 1, 4, and 5 at the same positions but with varying sizes depending on their order in the sequence. Specifically, if there are n consecutive objects with color 2, then they will be transformed into one object with color 1 (if n is odd) or two adjacent objects with color 4 and 5 (if n is even).",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the objects with color 2.\n2. Determine the number of consecutive objects with color 2.\n3. If the count is odd, replace them with one object with color 1; otherwise, replace the first half with an object with color 4 and the second half with an object with color 5.",

        "object_description": "There are three objects with color 2: one starting at index 1, another starting at index 6, and the last starting at index 10. Their respective sizes are 2, 1, and 3.",
