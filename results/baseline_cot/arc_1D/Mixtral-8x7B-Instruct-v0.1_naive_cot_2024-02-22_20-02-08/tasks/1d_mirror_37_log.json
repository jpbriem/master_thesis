            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON format response to your request:\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, object_1 (color 2) moved to the right by 5 positions, preserving its size.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"In Example_2, object_1 (color 2) moved to the right by 7 positions, preserving its size.\",\n        \"Example_3\": \"In Example_3, object_1 (color 2) moved to the right by 8 positions, preserving its size.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Given an input sequence with one object (consecutive non-zero pixels), the object moves to the right by a number of positions determined by the position of the first pixel of the object, while preserving its size.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To apply the transformation to a new input sequence, follow these steps:\\n1. Identify the object in the input sequence.\\n2. Determine the position of the first pixel of the object.\\n3. Move the entire object to the right by the same number of positions.\\n4. Preserve the size of the object during the movement.\",\n    \"transformation\": {\n        \"input\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        \"object_description\": \"There is one object in this input sequence, consisting of three consecutive pixels with value 1, starting at index 2 and ending at index 4, with a total size of 3.\",\n        \"transformed_objects\": \"The object will move to the right by 3 positions, starting at index 5 and ending at index 7, still having a size of 3.\",\n        \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n    },\n    \"test_output\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* In the given test case, there is one object with color 1, starting at index 2, ending at index 4, and having a size of 3.\n* To obtain the test output, we need to move the object to the right by 3 positions, so it starts at index 5 and ends at index 7, still having a size of 3."
