prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the description, overall pattern, instructions, transformation, and test output:
```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the long object (color 4) moves to the right by one position, replacing the noise pixels at the beginning of the sequence.",
        "Example_2": "In Example_2, the long object (color 7) moves to the right by six positions, placing itself before the other long object (color 9), while preserving their relative order."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input sequence with two long objects (one of color 7 and one of any other color), the output sequence will have those objects moved towards each other until they touch, maintaining their original order.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation, follow these steps: 1) Find the leftmost long object (color 7). 2) Find the second long object (any color but 7). 3) Move both objects towards each other, stopping when they touch. Make sure to preserve their relative order during this process.",
    "transformation": {
        "input": [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "object_description": "There are two main objects in the input sequence: a long object of color 7 (size 8) starting at index 3, and another long object of color 9 (size 1) starting at index 11. There are also noise pixels scattered throughout the sequence.",
        "transformed_objects": "The long object of color 7 remains unchanged in terms of size and color, but it moves to the right by three positions, ending up at index 6. The long object of color 9 also maintains its size and color, but it moves to the left by four positions, ending up at index 7.",
        "output": "[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
    },
    "test_output": [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
Note that I've provided the `test_output` directly instead of creating a function to generate it since you requested just the output value.
