prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we can see two objects (one red and one blue) and some noise pixels. In the output sequence, the red object has been copied twice, while the blue object remains unchanged.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there is only one object (red). It has been duplicated three times in the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'Again, there is only one object (blue), but it has been moved forward by four positions compared to the original input sequence.', 'overall_pattern': 'We observe that the overall pattern consists of copying/moving an existing object and adding zeros at the beginning and end of the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps:\n\t1. Identify the number of objects present in the input sequence.\n\t2. Determine whether each object needs to be copied or moved.\n\t3. If an object needs to be copied, create multiple copies of it according to the specified rule.\n\t4. If an object needs to be moved, shift it along the sequence by the given amount of positions.\n\t5. Add leading and trailing zeros to match the desired output sequence length.'}, 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: \nObject_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}\nObject_2: {color: 5, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}', 'transformed_objects': 'For the test output sequence, both objects remain unchanged regarding their size and position. However, Object_1 will be copied once more after itself. Thus, the final output sequence should look like this: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5].'}}
