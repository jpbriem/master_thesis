prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects (one red and one blue) separated by three zeros. In the output, these three zeros are replaced by six blues.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there are four zeros separating the red object from the green object. These four zeros are replaced by nine greens in the output.', 'Example_3': 'Similarly, here five zeros separate the red object from the green object. They are replaced by seven greens in the output.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'We can observe that the number of zeros between two adjacent objects determines the number of pixels of the second object\'s color that will replace them. This means that if there are n zeros between two objects, then those n zeros will be replaced by n times the number of pixels of the second object\'s color.', 'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Determine the number of zeros between each pair of adjacent objects.\n3. Replace those zeros with the appropriate number of pixels of the second object's color.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all zeros have been replaced.\n5. Return the modified output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: an object of size 4 starting at index 1 with color 4 (red), and another object of size 8 starting at index 8 with color 8 (green).', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the object of size 4 starting at index 1 with color 4 (red) remains unchanged. However, the object of size 8 starting at index 8 with color 8 (green) expands to include the eight zeros between it and the previous object. Thus, the final object has size 12 and starts at index 1.', 'output': [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]}
