prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of eight ones (1) at the beginning of the input sequence. In the output sequence, the object has been extended by one element to the right.', 'Example_2': 'Here, we observe two objects, each containing three twos (2). They are located next to each other in the input sequence. In the output sequence, they have been merged into one single object containing six elements.', 'Example_3': 'We can identify four objects in the input sequence: One consisting of five ones (1), another one made up of three zeros (0), followed by a third object also containing three zeros (0), and finally an eighth object (8). In the output sequence, the first object has been extended by one element to the left. The second and third objects have been merged into one single object containing six elements. Finally, the fourth object remains unchanged.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to be about extending objects by one element if there is enough space available. If multiple adjacent objects exist, they will be merged into one larger object.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, you need to follow these instructions: First, analyze the input sequence and identify any existing objects. Secondly, check whether it is possible to extend them by one element towards either side while still maintaining their original shape. If so, do it; otherwise skip this part. Thirdly, examine if there are multiple adjacent objects present - if yes, merge them together into bigger entities. Last but not least, make sure that no gaps remain between newly formed/extended objects after applying previous steps.', 'transformation': {'input': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are four distinct objects in the input sequence: An object consisting of ten fours (4), followed by an object containing two zeros (0), then another object composed of two more zeros (0), and finally an object made up of one eight (8).', 'transformed_objects': 'After performing the required transformations, the objects should appear as follows: The first object should now consist of eleven fours (4); the second and third objects should be merged into one single entity containing four zeros (0); lastly, the fourth object stays intact.', 'output': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]}
