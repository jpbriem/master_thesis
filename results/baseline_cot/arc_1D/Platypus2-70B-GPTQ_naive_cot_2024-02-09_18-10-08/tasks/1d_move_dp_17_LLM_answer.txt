prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of nine elements (start index = 1, end index = 9) and another consisting of eight elements (start index = 10, end index = 17). The overall pattern is to shift each object to the left by one element. This means that the first object will now occupy indices 0 through 8 while the second object will occupy indices 9 through 16. Finally, there is an additional noise pixel at index 18.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we again see two objects, but they differ slightly from those in Example_1. The first object consists of ten elements (start index = 1, end index = 10), and the second object also has ten elements (start index = 11, end index = 20). Again, the overall pattern is to shift each object to the left by one element. This results in the first object occupying indices 0 through 9 and the second object occupying indices 10 through 19. There is no noise pixel present in this example.', 'Example_3': 'Finally, in Example 3, we observe three distinct objects rather than just two. The first object contains five elements (start index = 1, end index = 5), followed by a gap of four empty spaces before encountering our next object containing six elements (start index = 10, end index = 15). Afterward, there's yet another gap consisting of three empty spaces until reaching our final object comprising seven elements (start index = 19, end index = 25). As usual, according to the established rule set forth previously - shifting every single item towards its respective left side - it becomes apparent that after applying said procedure onto these particular inputs; what emerges would be something along these lines: [0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0]. Notice how despite having multiple entities involved here; when performing said action upon them individually; ultimately leads us back down memory lane whereby everything gets pushed over accordingly so that nothing gets lost nor misplaced during transition process itself.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to shift each object to the left by one element.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions: \n\nStep 1: Identify all objects in both input and output sequences.\nStep 2: Determine their starting and ending indexes.\nStep 3: Shift each identified object to the left by one element.\nStep 4: If any gaps remain due to shifts made earlier, fill them with zeros.\nStep 5: Return the modified output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: one consisting of nine elements (start index = 1, end index = 9) and another consisting of eight elements (start index = 10, end index = 17).', 'transformed_objects': 'After shifting each object to the left by one element, the first object will now occupy indices 0 through 8 while the second object will occupy indices 9 through 16.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0]}
