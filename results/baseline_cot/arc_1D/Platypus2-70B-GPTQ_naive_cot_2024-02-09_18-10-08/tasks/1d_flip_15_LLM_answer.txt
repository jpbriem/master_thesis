prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one containing four elements (start index = 5) and another containing three elements (start index = 8). In the output sequence, these two objects are swapped.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there are three objects, each consisting of one element. They are moved to the rightmost positions in the output sequence.', 'Example_3': 'Similarly, here, there are five objects, each consisting of one element. They are also moved to the rightmost positions in the output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For any given input sequence, the output sequence will consist of the same number of elements as the input sequence. All objects in the input sequence will be shifted to the rightmost positions in the output sequence. If multiple objects occupy the same position, they will be sorted according to their sizes, starting from the largest object at the leftmost position.', 'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps:\n\t1. Identify all objects in the input sequence.\n\t2. Sort them according to their sizes, starting from the largest object at the leftmost position.\n\t3. Move each object to the rightmost position in the output sequence.\n\t4. Fill the remaining gaps with zeros.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence: an object containing six elements (start index = 1), an object containing four elements (start index = 3), and another object containing four elements (start index = 5).', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the objects should appear in the following order: the largest object (six elements) at the leftmost position, followed by the other two objects (four elements each) in descending order of their sizes.', 'output': [6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, 'test_output': np.array([[6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
