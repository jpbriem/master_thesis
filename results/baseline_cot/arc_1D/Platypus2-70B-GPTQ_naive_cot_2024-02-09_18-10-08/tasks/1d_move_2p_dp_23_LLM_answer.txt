prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of three elements (start index = 1, end index = 3) and another consisting of four elements (start index = 5, end index = 8). The overall pattern is to shift each object to the left by one element. This means that the first object will now start at index 0 instead of index 1, and the second object will start at index 6 instead of index 5. In addition, there must be no gaps between objects; if an object ends at index n, then the next object must begin at index n+1. Finally, note that any noise pixels (i.e., those with value 0) remain unchanged throughout the process.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we again see two objects - one consisting of six elements (start index = 1, end index = 6) and another consisting of four elements (start index = 7, end index = 10). As before, our goal is to shift each object to the left by one element while ensuring that there are no gaps between them. Thus, after applying these transformations, the first object starts at index 0 instead of index 1, and the second object begins at index 6 rather than index 7. It's worth mentioning that although some examples may appear similar due to their shared underlying patterns, they could differ slightly depending on specific details such as object sizes or positions. Therefore, it's essential to carefully examine every instance when performing data analysis tasks.', 'Example_3': 'Here we observe yet another pair of objects â€“ one made up of five elements (start index = 1, end index = 5) and another comprised of four components (start index = 6, end index = 9). Following the established trend, both objects need to be moved leftward by one unit each time without leaving empty spaces between them. Consequently, upon completion of these adjustments, the initial group would commence at slot number zero instead of its original starting point at position one; meanwhile, its successor commences right away afterwards occupying slots seven through ten inclusively.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to shift each object to the left by one element while ensuring that there are no gaps between them. Additionally, any noise pixels (i.e., those with value 0) remain unchanged throughout the process.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions: Firstly, identify all existing objects in the given input sequence. Secondly, determine whether any noise pixels exist within said input sequence. If so, leave them unaltered during subsequent operations. Thirdly, calculate the start indices and end indices of each identified object using zero-based indexing. Fourthly, apply shifting logic to each object according to its respective start/end indices. Fifthly, ensure continuity between adjacent objects by eliminating potential gaps caused by shifts. Lastly, return the final transformed output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0], 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, we can observe two distinct objects: one composed of three elements (start index = 1, end index = 3) and another containing four components (start index = 5, end index = 8). Both objects possess unique colors represented by numerical values ranging from 1-9. There are also several noise pixels present in this particular scenario, indicated by zeros.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying appropriate transformations, both objects should appear shifted towards the left side by one element each. Specifically speaking, the former object would initiate at index zero instead of its previous location at position one whereas its counterpart would commence immediately afterwards spanning across indexes six through nine respectively. Furthermore, it's crucial to maintain seamless transitions between neighboring entities thus avoiding unnecessary breaks or discontinuities.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0]}, 'test_output': [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0]}
