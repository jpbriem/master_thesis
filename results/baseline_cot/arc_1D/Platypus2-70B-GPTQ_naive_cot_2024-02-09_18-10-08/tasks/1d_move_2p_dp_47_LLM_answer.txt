prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of seven elements starting at index 1 and ending at index 7 (size = 7), and another object consisting of eight elements starting at index 16 and ending at index 23 (size = 8). In the output sequence, both objects are shifted left by three positions each. This means that the first object starts at index -2 and ends at index 4, while the second object starts at index 13 and ends at index 19. Note that the background color remains unchanged throughout the sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we again observe two objects, but their sizes differ from those in Example_1. The first object consists of four elements starting at index 1 and ending at index 4 (size = 4), followed by another object consisting of thirteen elements starting at index 10 and ending at index 22 (size = 13). In the output sequence, both objects are shifted left by six positions each. As a result, the first object now starts at index -5 and ends at index 1, while the second object starts at index 4 and ends at index 16. Again, note that the background color remains unchanged throughout the sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to involve shifting objects left by some fixed number of positions, regardless of their original size or location. However, it's unclear what determines this fixed number since there doesn't seem to be any obvious correlation between the input and output sequences. Perhaps more data points would help reveal additional insights about the underlying logic behind these transformations.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, you need to identify the objects present in the input sequence and determine how many positions they should be shifted left by. Once you know this information, simply update the corresponding indices accordingly and return the modified output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, we can observe two distinct objects: an initial object consisting of five elements starting at index 1 and ending at index 5 (size = 5) and a subsequent object consisting of eight elements starting at index 11 and ending at index 18 (size = 8). Both objects are separated by a single element of value 0.', 'transformed_objects': 'For the test output sequence, we expect both objects to be shifted left by nine positions each. Consequently, the first object will begin at index -8 and terminate at index -3, whereas the second object will commence at index 2 and conclude at index 9. Please keep in mind that the background color stays constant across the entire sequence.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
