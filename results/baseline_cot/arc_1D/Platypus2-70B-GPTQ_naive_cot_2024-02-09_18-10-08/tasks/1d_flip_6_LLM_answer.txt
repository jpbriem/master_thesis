prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object of size 6 at index 9 (start) and 14 (end). This object has been moved one place to the left.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we see an object of size 9 at index 1 (start) and 9 (end). This object has been moved one place to the right.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we see two objects. One object of size 9 at index 1 (start) and 9 (end), and another object of size 1 at index 10 (start) and 10 (end). These objects have been swapped.', 'overall_pattern': 'We can observe that there is always exactly one object in each pair of inputs and outputs. We also notice that the objects are either shifted one place to the left or right, or they are swapped.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions: Step 1: Identify the object(s) in both the input and output sequences. Step 2: Determine if the object(s) need to be shifted or swapped. If it needs to be shifted, decide whether it will be shifted to the left or right. Step 3: Perform the required action on the identified object(s).', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There is one object in the input sequence. It starts at index 9 and ends at index 14. Its size is 6 and its color is 5.', 'transformed_objects': 'The object should be shifted one place to the right.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
