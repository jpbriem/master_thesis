prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of ten consecutive 7s at the beginning of the input sequence. In the output sequence, there are eleven consecutive 7s. This means that one additional 7 has been added to the front of the object.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of nine consecutive 4s starting at index 5 of the input sequence. In the output sequence, there are ten consecutive 4s. This means that one additional 4 has been added to the back of the object.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of twelve consecutive 4s starting at index 1 of the input sequence. In the output sequence, there are thirteen consecutive 4s. This means that one additional 4 has been added to the back of the object.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'We can observe that in each example, the number of elements in the object increases by one compared to the input sequence. Therefore, the overall pattern seems to be adding one element to the object(s) in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps: \n\nStep 1: Identify any objects present in the input sequence.\nStep 2: Determine if the object's size needs to increase by one (either at the front or back). If so, add another element of the same value as the object's current last/first element.\nStep 3: Repeat Step 2 until no more objects require modification.\nStep 4: Return the modified output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0], 'object_description': 'There is only one object in the input sequence, which consists of ten consecutive 4s starting at index 6.', 'transformed_objects': 'Since the object already starts with four zeros, it does not need to be extended at the front. However, since the object ends with two zeros, it requires extension at the back. To do this, simply append another 4 after the existing ones.', 'output': [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]}, 'test_output': [[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]]
