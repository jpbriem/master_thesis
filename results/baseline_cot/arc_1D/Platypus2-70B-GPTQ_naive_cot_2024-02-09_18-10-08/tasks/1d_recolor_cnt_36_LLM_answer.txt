prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two groups of three adjacent 7s each. In the second group, one 7 has been replaced by a 0. This means that there are now four 7s instead of six.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we also see two groups of three adjacent 7s each. However, in the second group, two 7s have been replaced by 0s. This means that there are now eight 7s instead of nine.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we again see two groups of three adjacent 7s each. However, in the second group, all three 7s have been replaced by 0s. This means that there are now twelve 7s instead of thirteen.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to be that when there are multiple groups of adjacent numbers (in this case, 7s), some of those numbers may be replaced by other numbers (in this case, 0s). The number of replacement digits depends on the specific example given.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation actions, you need to follow these steps: \n\n1) Identify any groups of adjacent numbers in the input sequence.\n2) Determine how many digits need to be replaced in each group according to the provided instructions.\n3) Replace the specified digits with the appropriate value (either 0 or another digit).\n4) Output the modified sequence as the final result.\n\nNote that the exact details of what needs to change will vary depending on the specific example given.
