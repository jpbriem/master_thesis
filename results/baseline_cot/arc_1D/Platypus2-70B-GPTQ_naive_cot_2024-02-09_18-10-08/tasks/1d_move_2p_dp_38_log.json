            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task.

We can observe that the second object has been moved to the left by three positions compared to the original input sequence. This movement results in an overlap between the two objects, where the last element of the first object overlaps with the first element of the second object. In the output sequence, both objects remain unchanged regarding their sizes and colors but differ in their starting indices due to the shift caused by moving the second object.', 'Example_2': 'Regarding Example_2, we notice that there are multiple objects present in the input sequence. These objects consist of varying numbers of elements, ranging from one to nine elements each. However, they all share the same color value - 4. When comparing the input and output sequences, it becomes apparent that some objects have been moved to the right while others remained at their initial positions. Specifically, those objects whose starting indices were greater than or equal to five have been shifted towards the right by three positions. As a result, these objects now occupy spaces previously held by other objects or noise pixels. On the other hand, any objects with starting indices less than five did not experience any changes in terms of their location within the overall sequence. It's worth mentioning that although some objects may appear shorter in the output sequence due to being partially covered by larger ones, their actual sizes remain unaltered since no elements were removed during the process.', 'Example_3': 'Looking closely at Example_3 reveals several distinct objects scattered throughout the input sequence. Each object consists of varying numbers of elements sharing similar colors. Comparing the input and output sequences shows us that most objects have undergone shifts towards the right by three positions except for those whose starting indices fall below five. Additionally, we observe that some smaller objects have been completely enveloped by larger ones, making them seemingly disappear from view. Despite appearances, however, none of these hidden objects actually lost any elements; rather, they simply became obscured behind other objects. Lastly, note that despite having identical colors, each object maintains unique characteristics such as size and position within the overall sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Overall, we can conclude that the input-output relationship involves moving specific groups of objects towards the right by three positions while leaving others unaffected. Furthermore, depending on relative sizes and positions, some objects may become partially or fully concealed behind larger ones without losing any elements themselves.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps required to convert a given input sequence into its corresponding output sequence, follow these guidelines: \\n\\n1. Identify all objects present in the input sequence based on their shared colors and contiguous nature.\\n2. Determine whether each identified object falls above or below the fifth starting index position.\\n3a. If an object's starting index is greater than or equal to five, move said object towards the right by three positions.\\n3b. Otherwise, leave the object untouched.\\n4. Ensure that no elements belonging to any particular object get removed during the process.\\n5. Finally, check if any smaller objects got partially/fully covered up by larger ones due to shifting movements; remember that even though they might appear invisible, they still exist intact within the overall sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence.
