prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects (one red and one blue) separated by some noise pixels. In the output, both objects are moved to the right by three positions. Additionally, their sizes are doubled.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there are four objects (two red and two blue). They are also moved to the right by three positions and their sizes are doubled.', 'Example_3': 'Similarly, here, there are five objects (three red and two blue), which are again moved to the right by three positions and their sizes are doubled.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each object, it moves to the right by three positions and doubles its size.', 'instructions': 'First, identify the objects in the input sequence. Then, move them to the right by three positions and double their sizes. Finally, create the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], 'object_description': 'There are six objects in total: three red ones at indices 1, 5, and 7; and three blue ones at indices 3, 9, and 11. Their original sizes are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, they will become eight red ones at indices 4, 6, and 8; and eight blue ones at indices 6, 12, and 14. Their final sizes will be 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, and 2 respectively.', 'output': [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]}
