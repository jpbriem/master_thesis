prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]



Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of ten elements starting at index 6. This object is moved one element forward (to the left) in the output sequence.', 'Example_2': 'Here, we can observe two objects. One consists of six elements starting at index 7, while the other has five elements starting at index 12. Both objects are shifted one element backward (to the right).', 'Example_3': 'Similarly, there are two objects here. One contains eight elements beginning at index 8, whereas the second comprises four elements commencing at index 13. They are both moved one element ahead (to the left).'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each object, it moves one element either forward or backward depending on whether the number of elements in the object is odd or even. If the number of elements in the object is odd, then it will move one element forward; otherwise, if the number of elements in the object is even, then it will move one element backward.', 'instructions': 'First, identify the objects in the input sequence. Next, determine their sizes and positions. Afterwards, decide whether they need to be moved forward or backward according to their parity. Finally, create the output sequence by shifting these objects accordingly.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence. The first object starts at index 0 and ends at index 4, containing six elements. The second object begins at index 5 and finishes at index 9, having five components. Lastly, the third object initiates at index 10 and terminates at index 13, encompassing four constituents.', 'transformed_objects': 'Since the first object has an odd number of elements, it needs to be moved one element forward. Thus, its new starting point would become index 1, and its ending point would change to index 5. Similarly, since the second object also has an odd number of elements, it must be shifted one element forward too. Consequently, its updated starting point becomes index 6, and its concluding point changes to index 10. In contrast, because the third object possesses an even number of elements, it requires being displaced one element backward instead. As a result, its modified starting point turns out to be index 9, and its finishing point alters to index 12.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3]}
