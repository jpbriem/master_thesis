prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of four ones (start index = 1, end index = 4) and another consisting of three zeros (start index = 6, end index = 8). In the output, both objects are shifted left by one unit. This means that the object consisting of ones now starts at index 0 and ends at index 3, while the object consisting of zeros now starts at index 5 and ends at index 7.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we again see two objects, one consisting of six eights (start index = 1, end index = 6) and another consisting of three zeros (start index = 8, end index = 10). As before, both objects are shifted left by one unit in the output. This means that the object consisting of eights now starts at index 0 and ends at index 5, while the object consisting of zeros now starts at index 7 and ends at index 9.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we see three objects, one consisting of five fives (start index = 4, end index = 8), another consisting of two zeros (start index = 9, end index = 10), and yet another consisting of one seven (start index = 11, end index = 11). All objects are shifted left by one unit in the output. This means that the object consisting of fives now starts at index 3 and ends at index 7, the object consisting of zeros now starts at index 8 and ends at index 9, and the object consisting of sevens now starts at index 10 and ends at index 10.', 'overall_pattern': 'For each input-output pair, there exists an overall pattern. The overall pattern is that every object in the input sequence is shifted left by one unit in the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, you need to do the following: First, identify all objects in the input sequence. Second, determine their respective starting indices and ending indices. Third, create a new output sequence with the same number of elements as the input sequence. Fourth, shift each identified object in the input sequence left by one unit and place it accordingly in the output sequence. Fifth, return the newly created output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, we can observe two objects: One consisting of four fours (start index = 1, end index = 4) and another consisting of three zeros (start index = 6, end index = 8).', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the object consisting of fours will start at index 0 and end at index 3, while the object consisting of zeros will start at index 5 and end at index 7.', 'output': [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]}
