prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of five elements (start index = 4) and another consisting of nine elements (start index = 11). Both objects are moved to the right by their respective sizes. In other words, the object starting at index four is shifted to the right by five positions, while the object starting at index eleven is shifted to the right by nine positions. This results in both objects being placed next to each other after the transformation.', 'Example_2': 'Similarly, in Example_2, there are three objects - one consisting of three elements (start index = 2), another consisting of three elements (start index = 8), and yet another consisting of ten elements (start index = 17). All these objects are moved to the right by their respective sizes. As a result, they are also placed next to each other after the transformation.', 'Example_3': 'Finally, in Example_3, there are two objects - one consisting of seven elements (start index = 3) and another consisting of three elements (start index = 16). Again, both objects are moved to the right by their respective sizes, leading them to be placed next to each other after the transformation.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that any given object will be moved to the right by its own size. If multiple objects exist, they will be arranged side-by-side after the transformation.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions: \n\t1. Identify all existing objects in the input sequence.\n\t2. Determine the size of each identified object.\n\t3. Move every object to the right by its own size.\n\t4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more objects can be found/moved.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There is only one object in the input sequence, starting at index 8 and having a size of 2.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the object should be moved to the right by its own size (i.e., 2 positions). Thus, it would now start at index 10.', 'output': [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
