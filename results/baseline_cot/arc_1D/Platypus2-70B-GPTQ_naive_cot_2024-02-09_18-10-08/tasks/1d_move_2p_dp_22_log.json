            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\n\n\n### Response:\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of three elements (start index = 1, end index = 3) and another consisting of seven elements (start index = 5, end index = 11). The overall pattern is to shift each object left by one element. This means that the first object will now start at index 0 and end at index 2 while the second object will start at index 4 and end at index 10. There are no noise pixels present in either the input or output sequences.', 'Example_2': 'Regarding Example_2, we can observe that there are four objects in total - an initial noise pixel followed by three colored objects. The first colored object consists of seven elements starting from index 1 until index 7; the second colored object has nine elements starting from index 8 until index 16; the third colored object contains five elements starting from index 17 until index 21. To apply the given transformation pattern, we need to shift every object left by one element except for those whose start indices fall outside the range of [0..length(input)-1]. In other words, if an object's start index exceeds the maximum allowed value (i.e., length(input)-1), then it remains unchanged during shifting operations. As per our observations above, none of these conditions hold true here since all objects fit within bounds specified earlier. Therefore, after applying said rule, we obtain the desired output sequence where each object starts one unit earlier than before.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to shift each object left by one element. If an object's start index exceeds the maximum allowed value (i.e., length(input)-1), then it remains unchanged during shifting operations.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions: Firstly, identify all existing objects in both input and output sequences using their respective start/end indices along with associated sizes/colors etc.; Secondly, check whether any particular object falls beyond acceptable boundaries mentioned previously i.e., does its beginning point surpass last permissible limit? If yes, skip further processing otherwise proceed towards next stage involving actual movement procedure \u2013 simply slide everything over towards leftward direction keeping track of newly acquired positions throughout entire process until reaching final state required according to provided specifications.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are ten objects in the input sequence.

The third through ninth objects consist of one element each (start indices ranging from 3 to 9 respectively) and all have a color of 1.
