prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects (one red and one blue) being copied twice. The red object has a size of four and starts at index 1 while the blue object has a size of five and starts at index 8. In the output sequence, both objects are duplicated twice, starting at indices 5 and 12 respectively.', 'Example_2': 'Here, we observe three objects (red, green, and yellow) being copied twice each. The red object has a size of five and begins at index 1; the green object has a size of seven and starts at index 6; finally, the yellow object has a size of four and commences at index 11. In the resultant sequence, these objects are replicated twice beginning at positions 6, 12, and 16 respectively.', 'Example_3': 'We can identify four distinct objects in this scenario: red (size = 4), green (size = 5), yellow (size = 2), and white (size = 1). They begin at indices 1, 8, 12, and 15 respectively. When copying them twice, they will appear in the output sequence starting at locations 5, 13, 17, and 19 respectively.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Given an input sequence containing multiple objects represented by unique colors/values, duplicate each object exactly twice in the output sequence. To achieve this goal, follow these steps: \n\n1. Identify all existing objects in the input sequence along with their respective sizes, positions, and colors.\n2. Duplicate every identified object precisely twice in the output sequence according to its original properties (e.g., if there was originally one red object spanning four elements starting at index 1, create another identical red object starting at index 5). Make sure you maintain proper spacing between duplicates so that no overlapping occurs.\n3. Finally, return the newly generated output sequence containing doubled versions of all initial objects.'}
