prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two groups of three adjacent 7s each. In the second group, one 7 has been replaced by a 0. This means that there are now four 7s instead of six.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we see seven consecutive 7s followed by another group of three 7s. There is also an isolated 7 at the end. In the result, the number of 7s has decreased by half.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we see eight consecutive 7s followed by another group of four 7s. There is also an isolated 7 at the beginning and the end. In the result, the number of 7s has decreased by half.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the number of 7s in each group is halved. If there are an odd number of 7s in a group, then the last 7 is removed.', 'instructions': 'To transform a new input sequence, you need to do the following steps:\n\t1. Identify any groups of adjacent 7s.\n\t2. Halve the number of 7s in each group.\n\t3. If there are an odd number of 7s in a group, then remove the last 7.\n\t4.

The first group consists of three 7s starting at index 1 and ending at index 3. The second group consists of four 7s starting at index 8 and ending at index 11.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, there will be one group of two 7s starting at index 1 and ending at index 2. The other group will consist of two 7s starting at index 8 and ending at index 9.', 'output': [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
