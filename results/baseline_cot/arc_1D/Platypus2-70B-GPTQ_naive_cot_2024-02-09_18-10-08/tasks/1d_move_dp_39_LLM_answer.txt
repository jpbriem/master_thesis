prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of six elements (start index = 2, end index = 7) and another consisting of three elements (start index = 8, end index = 10). In the output, both objects are shifted left by four positions.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there are also two objects, but they are smaller than in Example_1. One consists of two elements (start index = 1, end index = 2), while the other has three elements (start index = 9, end index = 11). Again, both objects are moved left by four positions.', 'Example_3': 'Finally, we observe an object consisting of six elements (start index = 5, end index = 10) and another one containing three elements (start index = 11, end index = 13). Both objects are again shifted left by four positions.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each pair of input and output sequences, we can identify at least two objects. These objects are always shifted left by four positions.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, you need to do the following: First, find out how many objects exist in the input sequence. Then, determine their respective sizes and starting indices. Afterward, create a new output sequence with the same number of elements as the input sequence. Finally, shift every object in the input sequence left by four positions and insert it into the output sequence at the correct location. Make sure to keep track of the remaining free space after inserting each object so that you know where to place subsequent ones.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: one consisting of three elements (start index = 5, end index = 7) and another containing two elements (start index = 9, end index = 10).', 'transformed_objects': 'Both objects should be shifted left by four positions. Thus, the first object will now span from index 1 to 3, while the second one occupies indexes 5 and 6.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0]}, 'test_output': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0]]
