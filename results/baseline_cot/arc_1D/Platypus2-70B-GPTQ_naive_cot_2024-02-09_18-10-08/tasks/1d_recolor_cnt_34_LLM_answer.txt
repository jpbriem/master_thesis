prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects (one red and one green) separated by three black pixels. In the output, these three black pixels are replaced by blue ones.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there are four objects (two red and two green). They are separated by at least two black pixels each. In the output, the black pixels separating them are replaced by yellow ones.', 'Example_3': 'Again, there are four objects (two red and two green), but they are now separated by exactly one black pixel each. In the output, the black pixels separating them are replaced by orange ones.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'We can observe that the input contains several objects of different colors. These objects are always separated by some number of black pixels. The goal is to replace those black pixels with another color depending on their number. If there are no black pixels separating two objects, then the second object will be colored blue. Otherwise, if there is exactly one black pixel separating two objects, then the second object will be colored orange. Finally, if there are more than one black pixels separating two objects, then the second object will be colored yellow.', 'instructions': 'First, identify all objects in the input sequence. Then, count the number of black pixels separating any two adjacent objects. Depending on whether there are none, exactly one, or more than one black pixels separating them, assign either blue, orange, or yellow respectively to the second object.

The yellow object should become blue because it has no black pixels separating it from the next object. The blue object should become orange because it has exactly one black pixel separating it from the next object. The yellow object should become yellow again because it has exactly one black pixel separating it from the next object. Finally, the blue object should become yellow because it has more than one black pixel separating it from the next object.', 'output': [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]}
