prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of 15 elements starting at index 3 and ending at index 17. In the output, it has been moved one element to the left so that it starts at index 2 and ends at index 16.', 'Example_2': 'Here, we observe two objects, one consisting of 10 elements starting at index 4 and ending at index 13, and another consisting of 10 elements starting at index 14 and ending at index 23. In the output, both objects have been shifted one element to the right so that they now begin at indices 5 and 15 respectively and finish at indices 14 and 24.', 'Example_3': 'We can identify three distinct objects in this scenario: one comprising 10 components beginning at index 2 and concluding at index 11; another containing 10 parts commencing at index 12 and terminating at index 21; lastly, there's yet another made up of 10 pieces ranging from index 22 through 31. When compared against their original positions, these items appear unaltered after being transferred over to the resultant set.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that each object gets shifted one element to the left/right depending on whether it appears before or after the middle point (inclusively) of the input sequence. If multiple objects exist, then they will also get shifted accordingly relative to each other.', 'instructions': 'To perform this transformation, follow these steps:\n\t1. Identify all objects present in the input sequence.\n\t2. Determine if any given object lies before or after the midpoint (inclusively).\n\t3. Shift every identified object either one element towards the left or right side according to Step 2 results.\n\t4. Repeat Steps 1â€“3 until no more shifts occur due to reaching boundaries of the sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: \nObject_1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 2, size: 3}\nObject_2: {color: 6, start_index: 3, end_index: 5, size: 3}', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the objects should look like this:\nObject_1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 1, size: 2}\nObject_2: {color: 6, start_index: 2, end_index: 4, size: 3}', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
