prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of six elements (start index = 1, end index = 6) and another consisting of five elements (start index = 8, end index = 12). The overall pattern is to shift each object to the left by one element. This means that the first object will now start at index 0 and end at index 5, while the second object will start at index 7 and end at index 11. There may also be noise pixels present in the input sequence, but they do not affect the final output sequence.', 'Example_2': 'Similarly, in Example_2, there are two objects - one consisting of four elements (start index = 1, end index = 4) and another consisting of five elements (start index = 8, end index = 12). Again, the overall pattern is to shift each object to the left by one element. This results in the first object starting at index 0 and ending at index 3, while the second object starts at index 7 and ends at index 11.', 'Example_3': 'Finally, in Example_3, there are three objects - one consisting of six elements (start index = 4, end index = 9), another consisting of six elements (start index = 10, end index = 15), and yet another consisting of five elements (start index = 16, end index = 20). As before, the overall pattern is to shift each object to the left by one element. Thus, the first object starts at index 3 and ends at index 8; the second object starts at index 9 and ends at index 14; and finally, the third object starts at index 15 and ends at index 19.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to shift each object to the left by one element.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, you need to identify any existing objects in both input and output sequences. Once identified, apply the shifting rule mentioned above to each object individually. Finally, ensure that no additional changes occur outside these specified regions.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, we observe two distinct objects: an initial group of seven consecutive elements (start index = 1, end index = 7) followed by another set containing five elements (start index = 8, end index = 12).', 'transformed_objects': 'For our desired result, we want to shift every single object towards their respective left sides by exactly one unit. Consequently, our modified groups would appear as follows: First Group - Start Index = 0 & End Index = 6 Second Group - Start Index = 7 & End Index = 11', 'output': [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
