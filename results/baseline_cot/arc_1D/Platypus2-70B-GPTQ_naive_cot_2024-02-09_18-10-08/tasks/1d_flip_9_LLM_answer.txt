prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of eight elements (start index = 7) and another consisting of three elements (start index = 1). In the output, these two objects are swapped.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there are four objects, each consisting of six elements. They are arranged in an alternating order in the input sequence. In the output, they are also arranged in an alternating order but starting from the leftmost object instead of the rightmost one.', 'Example_3': 'There are five objects in this example, each consisting of five elements. They are arranged in an increasing order in the input sequence. In the output, they are still arranged in an increasing order but starting from the rightmost object instead of the leftmost one.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the objects are swapped according to their sizes. If there are multiple objects of equal size, they are arranged in an alternating order in both the input and output sequences. However, the direction of the arrangement may differ depending on whether it starts from the leftmost or rightmost object.', 'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps:
1. Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their start indices and element counts.
2. Sort the objects in descending order of their sizes.
3. Swap the objects according to their positions in the sorted list.
4. Repeat Step 3 until no more swaps can be made.
5. Output the transformed sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': [{'size': 4, 'position': [0, 3], 'color': 1}, {'size': 4, 'position': [4, 7], 'color': 4}], 'transformed_objects': [{'size': 4, 'position': [4, 7], 'color': 4}, {'size': 4, 'position': [0, 3], 'color': 1}]}, 'test_output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
