prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
output: [0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two groups of ones (red) separated by zeros (black). In the second group, there are three red ones next to each other. In the third group, there are four red ones next to each other.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we also see two groups of ones (red), but they are closer together than in Example_1. There are four red ones in the first group and eight red ones in the second group.', 'Example_3': 'Again, we see two groups of ones (red), but now they are even closer together. There are nine red ones in the first group and four red ones in the second group.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'We can observe that the number of red ones increases when they are closer together. This means that if there are more red ones close to each other, their value will increase by one compared to the previous group. If there are fewer red ones close to each other, their value will decrease by one compared to the previous group.', 'instructions': 'To transform an input sequence into its output sequence, follow these steps: \n\t1. Identify any groups of adjacent red ones.\n\t2. Determine whether the current group has more or fewer red ones than the previous group.\n\t3. If the current group has more red ones than the previous group, add one to the value of the red ones in the current group.\n\t4. If the current group has fewer red ones than the previous group, subtract one from the value of the red ones in the current group.\n\t5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the end of the input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two groups of red ones in the input sequence. The first group consists of three red ones, while the second group contains four red ones.', 'transformed_objects': 'Since the second group has more red ones than the first group, we need to add one to the value of the red ones in the second group. Therefore, the final output sequence should be [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0].'}}
