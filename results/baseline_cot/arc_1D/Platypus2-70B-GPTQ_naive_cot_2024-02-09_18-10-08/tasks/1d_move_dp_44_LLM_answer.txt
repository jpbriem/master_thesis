prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9]



Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of three elements (start index = 1, end index = 3) and another consisting of four elements (start index = 6). We can observe that the second object has been moved to the left side of the first object. This movement results in an increase in the number of elements in the first object by one element. In other words, the first object now consists of four elements instead of three.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we also see two objects, one consisting of three elements (start index = 1, end index = 3) and another consisting of five elements (start index = 6). Similar to Example_1, the second object has been moved to the left side of the first object. However, since there are more elements in the second object than in the first object, it overlaps with some elements of the first object after being shifted. As a result, the first object now consists of six elements instead of three.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we again see two objects, one consisting of three elements (start index = 1, end index = 3) and another consisting of five elements (start index = 6). Unlike Examples 1 and 2, however, the second object has been moved to the right side of the first object. Therefore, the first object remains unchanged with three elements.', 'overall_pattern': 'We notice that the overall pattern involves moving the second object either to the left or right side of the first object. If the second object contains fewer elements than the first object, then the first object will increase in size by one element. On the other hand, if the second object contains more elements than the first object, then the first object will increase in size by the number of elements in the second object minus one. Finally, if the second object contains exactly the same number of elements as the first object, no change occurs to the first object.', 'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps: \n\t1. Identify both objects present in the input sequence.\n\t2. Determine whether the second object needs to be moved to the left or right side of the first object.\n\t3. Move the second object accordingly.\n\t4. Check if the second object contains fewer, equal, or more elements than the first object.\n\t5. Update the size of the first object according to the overall pattern described above.'}, 'transformation': {'input': [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1 (start index = 1, end index = 3) and Object_2 (start index = 6). Both objects consist of three elements each.', 'transformed_objects': 'Move Object_2 to the right side of Object_1. Since they have the same number of elements, no changes occur to either object.', 'output': [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]}, 'test_output': [[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]]
