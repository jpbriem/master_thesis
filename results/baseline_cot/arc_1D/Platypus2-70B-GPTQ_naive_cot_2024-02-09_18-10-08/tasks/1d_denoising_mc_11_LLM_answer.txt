prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of seven elements starting at index 2 and ending at index 8, and another object consisting of eight elements starting at index 16 and ending at index 23. Both objects have the same color (7). In the output sequence, both objects are copied and placed after their original positions. Thus, the second object starts at index 24 and ends at index 31.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, there are three objects, an object consisting of four elements starting at index 4 and ending at index 7, an object consisting of five elements starting at index 12 and ending at index 16, and an object consisting of six elements starting at index 18 and ending at index 23. All objects have the same color (1) and are aligned horizontally. In the output sequence, each object is duplicated and placed directly below the original object. Thus, the first object now consists of eight elements starting at index 8 and ending at index 11, the second object consists of ten elements starting at index 16 and ending at index 25, and the third object consists of twelve elements starting at index 24 and ending at index 35.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, there are two objects, an object consisting of nine elements starting at index 4 and ending at index 12, and an object consisting of eleven elements starting at index 14 and ending at index 24. Both objects have the same color (5), but they do not align horizontally. In the output sequence, each object is duplicated and placed directly below the original object. Thus, the first object now consists of eighteen elements starting at index 14 and ending at index 31, and the second object consists of twenty-two elements starting at index 26 and ending at index 47. Note that since the second object overlaps with the first object in the input sequence, it has been shifted down by one element in the output sequence so that it does not overlap anymore.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to duplicate each object and place it directly below the original object. If multiple objects exist, they will be arranged vertically according to their horizontal order in the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify all objects in the input sequence.\nStep 2: Duplicate each identified object and arrange them vertically below the original objects.\nStep 3: Check if any of the newly added objects overlap with existing ones.
