prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of four elements (start index = 6) and another consisting of seven elements (start index = 1). In the output, both objects are shifted left by three positions. This means that the object starting at index 6 will now start at index 3, while the other object will start at index 4.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there are also two objects, but they differ in their sizes. One consists of eight elements (start index = 1), while the other has just one element (start index = 9). Again, both objects are moved left by three positions. So, the larger object starts at index 2 instead of index 1, and the smaller object moves from index 9 to index 6.', 'Example_3': 'Finally, we observe an interesting behavior when dealing with overlapping objects. There are again two objects, each having five elements (start indices = 4 and 8 respectively). However, since these objects partially overlap, they cannot simply be shifted together. Instead, the second object is moved behind the first one so that it does not interfere anymore. Thus, after shifting everything left by three positions, we obtain the desired result.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'We can summarize our observations as follows: Given any number of non-overlapping objects Ai (with i ranging from 1 to n), where each object contains ai elements (ai > 0), perform the following steps: - Shift every object Ai left by ai + 1 positions. If multiple objects occupy the same space initially, make sure that none of them overlap afterwards. - Finally, sort all remaining elements according to their original order. Note that if some elements were removed due to overlaps, those gaps must remain empty.', 'instructions': 'To apply this rule correctly, you need to keep track of several things simultaneously: Firstly, remember how many elements belong to each individual object; Secondly, pay attention to whether two or more objects touch each other; And thirdly, never forget about preserving the initial order of elements whenever possible. Good luck!', 'transformation': {'input': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}, Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 10, end_index: 10, size: 1}', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the overall pattern, the objects should look like this: Transformed_Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 2, end_index: 5, size: 4}, Transformed_Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 7, end_index: 7, size: 1}', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]}}
