prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of three elements (start index = 5) and another consisting of four elements (start index = 7). In the output, both objects are shifted to the left by one element. This means that the object starting at index 5 now starts at index 6, and the object starting at index 7 now starts at index 8. Additionally, there is an extra element added before each object, so the total number of elements increases by two.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we see one object consisting of thirteen elements (start index = 8). In the output, the object is shifted to the left by one element, meaning it now starts at index 9 instead of index 8. There is also an additional element added before the object, increasing the total number of elements by one.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we see one object consisting of five elements (start index = 9). In the output, the object is shifted to the left by one element, meaning it now starts at index 10 instead of index 9. There is also an additional element added before the object, increasing the total number of elements by one.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For all input-output pairs, the overall pattern is that objects are shifted to the left by one element and an additional element is added before each object. This results in an increase in the total number of elements by the number of objects plus one.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions: \n\nStep 1: Identify the objects in the input sequence.\nStep 2: Shift each object to the left by one element.\nStep 3: Add an additional element before each object.\nStep 4: Return the transformed output sequence.\n\nNote that the number of objects may vary across different input sequences, but the overall pattern remains consistent.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there are two objects present:\nObject_1: {color: 2, start_index: 10, end_index: 12, size: 3}\nObject_2: {color: 8, start_index: 14, end_index: 14, size: 1}', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the objects should appear as follows:\nObject_1: {color: 2, start_index: 11, end_index: 13, size: 3}\nObject_2: {color: 8, start_index: 15, end_index: 15, size: 1}', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
