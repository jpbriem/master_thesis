prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one containing three elements (start index = 5, end index = 7) and another containing four elements (start index = 8, end index = 11). The overall pattern is to shift each object left by one element while keeping their relative positions intact. This means that if an object has n elements, it will be moved n - 1 steps to the left. In addition, any noise pixels before the first object will also be shifted accordingly.', 'Example_2': 'Similarly, in Example_2, there are two objects again but they have different sizes compared to those in Example_1. One contains five elements (start index = 4, end index = 8), and the other contains six elements (start index = 9, end index = 14). Again, we apply the same shifting rule where each object moves left by one less than its original size. As a result, both objects get shifted towards the beginning of the sequence without changing their order or relative distances.', 'Example_3': 'Finally, in Example_3, we observe just one large object spanning nine consecutive elements (start index = 2, end index = 10). Following our established pattern, we simply shift this single object eight steps to the left since it originally had nine elements. Note that no additional changes occur beyond what was already discussed earlier.', 'overall_pattern': 'Overall, given any input sequence consisting of multiple objects separated by noise pixels, we can follow these simple instructions to generate the desired output sequence: \n\t1. Identify all objects present in the input sequence along with their respective starting indices and ending indices.\n\t2. Shift every identified object leftwards according to its own size minus one unit.\n\t3. If necessary, adjust any preceding noise pixels so they remain aligned properly after applying Step #2.'},
'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, please follow these steps:\n\t1. Copy the provided test case input sequence into a variable called `input`. Make sure you preserve its exact length!\n\t2. Describe the objects found within the input sequence using their sizes, positions, and colors.\n\t3. Transform each object according to the specified instructions above.\n\t4. Create a new variable called `output` containing the transformed version of the input sequence.\n\t5. Return the newly created `output` sequence in NumPy array format. Remember to maintain the correct sequence length!'}}
