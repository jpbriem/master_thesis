prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of eight elements starting at index 1 (color = 8) and another object consisting of one element starting at index 11 (color = 1). We can observe that the second object has been moved to the left by three positions compared to the original input sequence. This means that the second object now starts at index 8 instead of index 11.', 'Example_2': 'Regarding Example_2, we again see two objects, one consisting of nine elements starting at index 1 (color = 4) and another object consisting of one element starting at index 11 (color = 1). In this example, both objects have been shifted to the left by two positions compared to their respective locations in the input sequence. This results in the first object starting at index 3 and the second object starting at index 9.', 'Example_3': 'Finally, in Example_3, we once more encounter two objects, one consisting of ten elements starting at index 1 (color = 6) and another object consisting of one element starting at index 11 (color = 1). Similarly to the previous examples, both objects have been shifted to the left by two positions compared to their initial locations in the input sequence. Consequently, the first object begins at index 5 and the second object starts at index 7.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Overall, it seems that there is a consistent pattern regarding the movement of objects in these examples. Specifically, each time an object appears in an input sequence, it gets shifted to the left by some number of positions before being included in the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To perform this transformation on a new input sequence, follow these steps: \n\t1. Identify all objects present in the input sequence.\n\t2. Determine how many positions each object needs to be shifted to the left.\n\t3. Shift every identified object accordingly.\n\t4. Combine all shifted objects into one final output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: \n\tObject 1: Color = 2; Start Index = 2; End Index = 10; Size = 9\n\tObject 2: Color = 1; Start Index = 11; End Index = 11; Size = 1', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the objects should appear as follows:\n\tObject 1: Color = 2; Start Index = 0; End Index = 8; Size = 9\n\tObject 2: Color = 1; Start Index = 8; End Index = 8; Size = 1', 'output': [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]}
