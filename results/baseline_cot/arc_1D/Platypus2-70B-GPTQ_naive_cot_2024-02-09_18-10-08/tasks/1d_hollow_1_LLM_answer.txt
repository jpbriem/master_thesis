prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of nine elements starting at index one and ending at index nine. In the output, there is no change regarding the object itself. However, the background has been removed, leaving only the object.', 'Example_2': 'Here, we observe two objects, each containing three elements. They begin at indices one and ten respectively and end at indices three and twelve respectively. In the output, both objects have been shifted left by four positions so they now start at indices five and fourteen respectively. Additionally, their sizes were reduced to just one element each. Finally, the background was cleared out completely.', 'Example_3': 'We can identify three distinct objects here - one made up of eleven elements beginning at index one; another composed of seven pieces commencing at location eight; lastly, a third comprising six components initiating at spot thirteen. All these items remain unaltered when compared against their counterparts found inside our desired result set except for some minor adjustments concerning their respective locations & dimensions (if applicable). Specifically speaking: * First item remains stationary but shrinks down to single unit size wise. * Second piece moves rightward by two steps while keeping original shape intact. * Third component shifts leftwards by three spots yet keeps form unchanged too.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Given any given sequence containing multiple colored segments separated via zeros denoting empty spaces/background noise - perform following operations upon them: * Move every segment leftwards until reaching farthest leftmost boundary allowed according to provided constraints. * Reduce each segment's width down to minimum required amount necessary for preserving overall structure integrity. * Remove excessive gaps caused due to previous movements if present anywhere else apart from initial boundaries mentioned earlier.', 'instructions': 'To achieve successful outcome follow below listed instructions carefully: * Identify all existing segments present within source material. Note down details pertaining towards size, position etcetera associated along side each individual instance separately. * Determine maximum allowable limit wherein said identified instances could potentially fit without overlapping nor exceeding predefined limits imposed externally. * Shift entire contents horizontally towards negative direction until reaching furthest extent permitted under current circumstances. Ensure no additional gap appears elsewhere other than those already accounted for initially. * Trim excess portions protruding beyond acceptable range mentioned above. Leave behind only essential bits required maintaining coherence among various parts involved throughout process.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are three objects in total. The first starts at index 1 and ends at index 8, having 7 elements. The second begins at index 9 and finishes at index 15, consisting of 6 units. Lastly, the third kicks off at slot 16 and concludes at point 24, encompassing 8 components altogether.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying specified transformations, final state looks something similar to this: * Initial segment gets moved backward slightly whilst retaining original count value. * Subsequent section slides forward slightly whilst reducing quantity count value. * Final portion stays put but decreases number count value.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
