prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of four elements starting at index 1 and ending at index 4, and another object consisting of six elements starting at index 6 and ending at index 11. In the output sequence, both objects are shifted to the left by three positions. This means that the first object starts at index 4 and ends at index 7, while the second object starts at index 9 and ends at index 14.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, there is only one object consisting of eight elements starting at index 1 and ending at index 8. In the output sequence, the object is shifted to the left by seven positions. This means that it now starts at index 8 and ends at index 15.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input-output pair, the overall pattern is that every object (a group of adjacent pixels of the same color) is moved to the left by the number of elements in the previous object(s). If there were no preceding objects, then the object would be moved to the left by the total number of elements in the input sequence minus the current object\'s element count.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Determine the number of elements in each object.\n3. Starting from the rightmost object, calculate the number of elements to shift it to the left by adding up the element counts of all preceding objects.\n4. Shift the identified object to the left by the calculated number of elements.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all objects have been processed.\n6. Output the modified sequence as the final result.', 'transformation': {'input': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There is only one object in the input sequence, consisting of five elements starting at index 1 and ending at index 5.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the object will be shifted to the left by the number of elements in the previous object(s), which is zero since there are no preceding objects. Therefore, the object will remain unchanged in the output sequence.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]}
