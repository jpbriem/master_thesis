prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of seven consecutive 7s at the beginning of the input sequence. In the output sequence, there is one additional 7 before the object starts.', 'Example_2': 'Here, we observe an object consisting of six consecutive 6s at the beginning of the input sequence. In the output sequence, there is one additional 6 before the object starts.', 'Example_3': 'Again, we can find an object consisting of five consecutive 5s at the beginning of the input sequence. In the output sequence, there is one additional 5 before the object starts.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each input-output pair, we notice that the first object in the input sequence has been extended by one element at the front. This means that the overall pattern is to add one element of the same type as the first object to the front of it.', 'instructions': 'To apply this transformation to a new input sequence, follow these steps:\n\t1. Identify the first object in the input sequence.\n\t2. Determine what type (e.g., color) the first object consists of.\n\t3. Add one element of the same type as the first object to the front of it.\n\t4. Repeat steps 1â€“3 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.\n\t5. Return the modified input sequence as the output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0], 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, we observe two objects: \nObject_1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 8, size: 9}\nObject_2: {color: 4, start_index: 9, end_index: 11, size: 3}', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the objects should look like this:\nObject_1: {color: 0, start_index: 0, end_index: 8, size: 9}\nObject_2: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 11, size: 4}', 'output': [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]}
