            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n### Response:\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n\n{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two groups of four adjacent pixels of the same color (4). These groups are separated by one black pixel (0) each. In the output, these groups are merged together so that they form larger groups of eight adjacent pixels of the same color (8). This process is repeated throughout the entire input sequence.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we also see two groups of four adjacent pixels of the same color (4), but there are no separating black pixels (0) between them. Therefore, the output remains unchanged compared to the input.', 'Example_3': 'Here, we again observe two groups of five adjacent pixels of the same color (5), separated by one black pixel (0). However, there is an additional group of three adjacent pixels of another color (9) at the beginning of the input sequence.

The additional group of three adjacent pixels of another color (9) remains untouched in the output.', 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to be that if there are two groups of n adjacent pixels of the same color, separated by exactly one black pixel, then those groups will be merged together in the output so that they form larger groups of 2n adjacent pixels of the same color. If there are no separating black pixels between two groups of n adjacent pixels of the same color, then nothing changes in the output. Additionally, any other groups of pixels that do not fit this pattern remain unaltered in the output.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, you can follow these instructions: \\n\\n1. Identify all groups of n adjacent pixels of the same color in the input sequence.\\n2. Check if there is exactly one black pixel separating each pair of neighboring groups.\\n3. If yes, merge the neighboring groups together by doubling their size and removing the separating black pixel(s).\\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more merging operations can be performed.\\n5. Any remaining groups of pixels that were not affected by the previous steps should stay unchanged in the output.'}"
