prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we can see two groups of objects. The first group consists of three objects (size = 2) starting at index 6. The second group also has three objects (size = 2), but they start at index 8. In the output sequence, both groups are shifted one unit to the left. This means that the first object starts at index 5 instead of 6, and the second object starts at index 7 instead of 8.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, there are four objects in total. Two objects belong to the first group, which starts at index 5. They have sizes of 2 each. The other two objects form the second group, which starts at index 11. Both objects have a size of 2 as well. In the output sequence, the first group remains unchanged, while the second group shifts one unit to the right. Thus, it now starts at index 12.', 'Example_3': 'There are five objects in this example. Three objects make up the first group, which begins at index 4. Each object has a size of 1. The remaining two objects constitute the second group, which starts at index 12. These objects also have a size of 1. In the output sequence, the first group stays where it was before, whereas the second group moves one unit to the left. Consequently, it now starts at index 11.', 'overall_pattern': 'We observe that whenever an odd number of objects appear consecutively, their positions remain unaltered. However, if an even number of consecutive objects exist, then those objects will always be moved one unit to either side depending on whether they are located on the left or right half of the input sequence.', 'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps: \n\t1. Identify any groups of consecutive objects in the input sequence.\n\t2. If you find an odd number of consecutive objects, leave them untouched.\n\t3. Otherwise, if you encounter an even number of consecutive objects, determine whether they lie on the left or right half of the input sequence.\n\t4. Move the entire group one unit to the opposite side relative to its current location.\n\t5. Repeat steps 1â€“4 until no more groups exist.'}
