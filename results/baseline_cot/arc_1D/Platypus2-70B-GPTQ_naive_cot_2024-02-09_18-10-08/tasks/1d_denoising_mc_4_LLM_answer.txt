prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 4, 5, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of two pixels of value 2 at positions 3 and 4. In the output, these two pixels are copied to the right side of the image, so they appear again at positions 7 and 8. This process is repeated until there are no more pixels left in the original object. As a result, we get an output sequence where each pixel has been duplicated once.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we see three objects: one consisting of four pixels of value 3 starting at position 2; another consisting of five pixels of value 4 starting at position 6; and finally, one consisting of six pixels of value 5 starting at position 7. In the output, these objects are copied to the right side of the image, so they appear again after their respective sizes (i.e., 4+1=5, 5+1=6, and 6+1=7). As a result, we get an output sequence where each object has been duplicated once.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of twenty-one pixels of value 8 starting at position 4. In the output, this object is copied to the right side of the image, so it appears again after its size (i.e., 21+1=22). As a result, we get an output sequence where each object has been duplicated once.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that every object in the input sequence gets duplicated once in the output sequence. To achieve this, we need to know the size and position of each object in both sequences.', 'instructions': 'To perform this transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1) Identify all objects in the input sequence.\n2) Determine the size and position of each identified object.\n3) Copy each object to the right side of the image, shifting it by its own size plus one pixel.\n4) Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more objects left in the input sequence.\n\nNote that some objects may overlap with others during copying, but this does not affect our goal since we want to duplicate them anyway.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are three objects in the input sequence: one consisting of two pixels of value 1 starting at position 5; another consisting of three pixels of value 3 starting at position 8; and finally, one consisting of eleven pixels of value 1 starting at position 10.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the output sequence will contain three copies of each object: one at its original location, followed by two duplicates shifted to the right by their respective sizes plus one pixel.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
