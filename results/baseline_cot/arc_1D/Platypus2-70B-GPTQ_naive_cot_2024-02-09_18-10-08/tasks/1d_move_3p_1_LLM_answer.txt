prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we can see that the input sequence contains an object of size 6 starting at index 4. In the output sequence, the object has been moved one position to the left. This means that the object now starts at index 3 and ends at index 8.', 'Example_2': 'Regarding the second example, we observe that there is an object of size 12 starting at index 12 in the input sequence. In the output sequence, the object has been shifted two positions to the right. Therefore, it now begins at index 14 and terminates at index 25.', 'Example_3': 'Looking at the third example, we notice that there is an object of size 11 beginning at index 11 in the input sequence. In the output sequence, the object has been moved three places to the left. As a result, it now commences at index 8 and concludes at index 18.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'We can conclude that the overall pattern involves moving objects to the left by a fixed number of positions. The amount of movement depends on the size of each individual object.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions: \n\nStep 1: Identify the objects present in both input and output sequences.\nStep 2: Determine the size of each identified object.\nStep 3: Move the object(s) to the left according to their respective sizes (e.g., if an object's size is X, then move it X positions to the left).\nStep 4: Repeat Steps 1-3 until no more objects remain unprocessed.', 'transformation': {'input': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are four objects in the input sequence: Object_1: {size: 1, start_index: 0, end_index: 0}, Object_2: {size: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 1}, Object_3: {size: 1, start_index: 2, end_index: 2}, Object_4: {size: 1, start_index: 3, end_index: 3}', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the objects will appear as follows: Transformed_Object_1: {size: 1, start_index: 0, end_index: 0}, Transformed_Object_2: {size: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 1}, Transformed_Object_3: {size: 1, start_index: 2, end_index: 2}, Transformed_Object_4: {size: 1, start_index: 3, end_index: 3}', 'output': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
