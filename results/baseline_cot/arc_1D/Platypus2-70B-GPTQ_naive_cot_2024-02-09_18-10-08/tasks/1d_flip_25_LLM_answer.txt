prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of six elements (start index = 7) and another consisting of five elements (start index = 11). In the output, these two objects are swapped.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there are three objects, each consisting of eight elements. They are arranged in order of their sizes, starting from the largest object at the beginning. In the output, they are also arranged in order of their sizes but reversely, starting from the smallest object at the beginning.', 'Example_3': 'There are four objects here, each consisting of eight elements except for the last object, which consists of four elements. In the output, the objects are arranged in reverse order compared to the input, starting from the largest object at the end.', 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the objects are arranged in reverse order compared to the input, starting from the largest object at either the beginning or the end depending on whether the number of objects is odd or even. If there are an odd number of objects, then the largest object starts at the beginning; if there are an even number of objects, then the largest object starts at the end.'}, 'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input sequence.\n2. Sort them in descending order according to their sizes.\n3. Reverse the sorted list so that the largest object appears first.\n4. Copy the objects from the reversed list back into the output sequence.\n\nNote that you need to keep track of the object positions and sizes during the transformation process.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, there are two objects in the input sequence. The first object has a size of 2 and starts at index 10. The second object has a size of 5 and starts at index 11.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation instructions, the objects will appear in the output sequence in reverse order compared to the input sequence, starting from the largest object at the beginning. So, the first object will now have a size of 5 and start at index 10, while the second object will have a size of 2 and start at index 11.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0]}
