The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}.

The overall pattern is to shift each object left by one element. This means that the first object will now start at index 3 and end at index 5 while the second object will start at index 6 and end at index 9. There may also be noise pixels present in both the input and output sequences.', 'Example_2': 'Regarding Example_2, there is only one object consisting of five elements (start index = 2, end index = 6).

As before, there may be noise pixels present in both the input and output sequences.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to shift each object left by one element.

If an object starts at index 0 after being shifted, it will be removed entirely from the output sequence.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions: First, identify any objects present in the input sequence. Determine their sizes, positions, and colors using arithmetics if needed. Next, apply the rule of shifting each object left by one element. Update the starting indices accordingly but keep track of whether they become negative due to being shifted beyond the beginning of the sequence. Finally, create the output sequence by copying over the input sequence with updated starting indices for identified objects. Remember to remove any objects whose starting indices became negative during the process.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], 'object_description': 'There is only one object in the input sequence consisting of six elements (start index = 2, end index = 7).
