prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two groups of seven consecutive zeros at positions 3 and 8. We also observe one group of four consecutive ones at position 6. In the output sequence, each object has been extended to the right until it reaches another object. This means that the group of seven zeros at position 3 now extends up to position 10 (inclusively). Similarly, the group of four ones at position 6 now extends up to position 9 (inclusively) and overlaps with the other group of seven zeros. Finally, the last group of seven zeros at position 8 remains unchanged since there is no other object to the right of it.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we see three groups of zeros at positions 4, 11, and 12. We also observe one group of fours at position 5. In the output sequence, each object has been extended to the right until it reaches another object. This means that the group of zeros at position 4 now extends up to position 11 (inclusively), while the group of zeros at position 11 extends up to position 12 (inclusively). However, since these two groups overlap, they form a single larger group spanning from position 4 to position 12 (inclusively). Lastly, the group of fours at position 5 remains unchanged since there is no other object to the right of it.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we see two groups of zeros at positions 6 and 11.

Meanwhile, the group of fives at position 7 remains unchanged since there is no other object to the right of it.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For every object in the input sequence, extend it to the right until it reaches another object.

Identify all objects present in both input and output sequences.\n2. Determine their sizes and starting indices based on their respective colors.\n3. Extend each object towards the right until it either reaches another object or runs out of space in the sequence.\n4. If multiple objects overlap during extension, combine them into a single larger object by merging their sizes and starting indices accordingly.\n5.
