prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of nine ones (1) at the beginning of the input sequence. In the output sequence, there are ten ones instead of nine. This means that one additional one has been added to the front of the object.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, we see two objects consisting of three threes (3) each, followed by another object consisting of four twos (2). In the output sequence, these objects remain unchanged. However, after the last object, there is now an additional three (3), meaning that it has been copied from the previous object.', 'Example_3': 'In this example, we see several objects consisting of fives (5), separated by other numbers. In the output sequence, these objects remain unchanged. However, after the last object, there is now an additional five (5), meaning that it has been copied from the previous object.', 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern seems to be that if there is more than one consecutive number of the same value in the input sequence, then they will be repeated consecutively in the output sequence until the next non-consecutive number appears. If there is only one consecutive number in the input sequence, then it will be duplicated once in the output sequence. Additionally, any noise pixels present in the input sequence will be ignored in the output sequence.'}, 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions: \n\nStep 1: Identify all objects in the input sequence.\nStep 2: Check if each identified object consists of multiple consecutive numbers of the same value.\nIf true, repeat them consecutively in the output sequence until the next non-consecutive number appears.\nIf false, duplicate the single number once in the output sequence.\nStep 3: Ignore any noise pixels present in the input sequence when creating the output sequence.\n\nFinal Step: Return the created output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'Regarding the test input, we can identify three objects: Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 4, end_index: 8, size: 5}, Object_2: {color: 4, start_index: 9, end_index: 9, size: 1}, Object_3: {color: 5, start_index: 10, end_index: 16, size: 7}', 'transformed_objects': 'Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 4, end_index: 12, size: 9}, Object_2: {color: 4, start_index: 9, end_index: 9, size: 1}, Object_3: {color: 5, start_index: 10, end_index: 16, size: 7}'}, 'test_output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
