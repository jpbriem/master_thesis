prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects of the same color (2) next to each other. In the output, they are separated by one empty space.', 'Example_2': 'Here, there are three objects of the same color (8). They are moved together so that no empty spaces remain between them.', 'Example_3': 'Again, there are three objects of the same color (8), but here, they are already close together. So, nothing changes.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'We can observe that the overall pattern is to group objects of the same color together without any gaps between them. This means that if an object has another object of the same color adjacent to it, then these objects will be merged into one larger object in the output. If there are multiple objects of the same color, they will be grouped together as well. However, if there are no more objects of the same color left after grouping, then the remaining objects stay unchanged.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, you need to follow these instructions: First, identify all objects in the input sequence. Second, check whether any two adjacent objects have the same color. If yes, merge them into one larger object by increasing their sizes accordingly and removing the gap between them. Repeat this process until no more merging is possible. Finally, return the modified output sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are five objects of the same color (3) in the input sequence. Their positions range from index 0 to 5, inclusively. Each object has a size of 1.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the five objects should be merged into one large object at the beginning of the sequence. Its position ranges from index 0 to 4, inclusively, and its size is now 5.', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]}
