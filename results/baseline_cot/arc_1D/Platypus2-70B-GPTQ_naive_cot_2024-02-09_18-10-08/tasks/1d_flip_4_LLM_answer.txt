prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one containing three elements (size = 3) starting at index 4 (start_index = 4), ending at index 6 (end_index = 6). The other object contains four elements (size = 4) starting at index 7 (start_index = 7), ending at index 10 (end_index = 10). In the output sequence, these two objects are swapped.', 'Example_2': 'Here, we can observe an object consisting of eight elements (size = 8) starting at index 4 (start_index = 4), ending at index 11 (end_index = 11). This object has been moved to the left side of the sequence in the output.', 'Example_3': 'We notice an object containing three elements (size = 3) starting at index 3 (start_index = 3), ending at index 5 (end_index = 5). Another object consists of four elements (size = 4) starting at index 6 (start_index = 6), ending at index 9 (end_index = 9). These two objects have been swapped in the output sequence.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For each pair of input-output sequences, there exists exactly one object in both sequences. If the object's size is odd, it will be shifted to the right; if even, it will be shifted to the left.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation steps, follow these instructions:
1. Identify the largest object in the input sequence.
2. Determine whether the identified object's size is odd or even.
3. Based on Step 2, decide whether to shift the object to the right or left.
4. Move the object accordingly, maintaining its original size and order.
5. Repeat Steps 1-4 until no more objects remain in the input sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], 'object_description': 'There is one object in the input sequence, containing five elements (size = 5) starting at index 5 (start_index = 5), ending at index 9 (end_index = 9).', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the overall pattern, the object should now consist of seven elements (size = 7) starting at index 4 (start_index = 4), ending at index 10 (end_index = 10).', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]}, 'test_output': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]]}
