prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see an object consisting of eight consecutive 8s at the beginning of the input sequence. In the output sequence, there are two copies of this object, one directly after the other.', 'Example_2': 'Here, we observe three objects in the input sequence: A group of three 3s, followed by a single 1, then another group of four 3s. In the output sequence, each of these groups has been duplicated so that they appear twice consecutively.', 'Example_3': 'Similarly to Example_2, we find multiple objects in both input and output sequences. However, while the number of elements per object remains unchanged (e.g., seven 1s), their order changes slightly - specifically, every second element shifts forward by one position compared to its original location. This results in alternating patterns where odd-numbered positions always hold identical values across all objects but even-numbered ones differ depending on whether it's part of an initial or repeated instance of said object.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'Given any input sequence containing various objects represented by distinct colors/values, our goal is to create an output sequence where each unique object appears twice consecutively without changing its internal structure nor altering individual element positions relative to others belonging to the same object.', 'instructions': 'To achieve this result, follow these steps: \n\n1) Identify all separate objects present in the given input sequence based on differences in color/value. Make note of their respective sizes (i.e., number of elements).\n2) Create a temporary container holding references to each identified object along with information about its current starting index within the source data.\n3) Iterate through the temporary containers maintaining references to previously encountered objects until reaching the end of the input sequence.\n4) If no more objects remain undiscovered, simply append duplicates of those already stored in memory onto the final output stream according to their recorded indices.\n5) Otherwise, locate newly discovered entities using predetermined criteria outlined above; add them alongside associated metadata into storage mentioned earlier;\n6) Repeat Step 3 until completion.\n\nNote that although some implementations may opt for alternative approaches involving direct manipulation of arrays rather than utilizing auxiliary structures, ultimately achieving desired behavior requires adherence to fundamental principles outlined herein regardless chosen methodology.', 'transformation': {'input': [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are five objects in the input sequence: An object of seven 7s, an object of one 1, an object of seven 7s, an object of two 7s, and an object of seven 7s.', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, there will be ten objects in total: Two objects of seven 7s, two objects of one 1, two objects of seven 7s, two objects of two 7s, and two objects of seven 7s.', 'output': [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}
