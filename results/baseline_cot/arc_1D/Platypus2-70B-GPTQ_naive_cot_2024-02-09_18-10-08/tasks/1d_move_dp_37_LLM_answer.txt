prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0]



Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two objects, one consisting of three elements (start index = 2, end index = 4) and another consisting of five elements (start index = 8). We can observe that the second object has been moved to the left by one element compared to the original input sequence. This movement results in an additional zero at the beginning of the output sequence. Additionally, there is no change in the number of elements in each object.', 'Example_2': 'Similarly, in Example_2, we also notice that the second object has been shifted to the left by one element. However, since it consists of six elements instead of five, there are now two zeros added at the beginning of the output sequence. Again, there is no change in the number of elements in either object.', 'Example_3': 'Finally, in Example_3, we again observe that the second object has been moved to the left by one element. As before, this leads to an increase in the number of leading zeros in the output sequence - in this case, by three. Once more, there is no alteration in the number of elements per object.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'We can conclude that the overall pattern involves shifting the second object to the left by one element while preserving its size. This causes an increase in the number of leading zeros proportional to the size of the second object.', 'instructions': 'To perform this transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the second object in the input sequence.\n2. Move the entire second object one element to the left.\n3. Add enough leading zeros to match the size of the second object.\n4. Output the modified sequence.', 'transformation': {'input': [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], 'object_description': 'There are two objects in the input sequence: \nObject_1: {color: 7, start_index: 0, end_index: 3, size: 4}\nObject_2: {color: 5, start_index: 7, end_index: 8, size: 2}', 'transformed_objects': 'After applying the transformation, the objects will appear as follows:\nObject_1: {color: 7, start_index: 1, end_index: 4, size: 4}\nObject_2: {color: 5, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 2}', 'output': [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0]}, 'test_output': [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0]]
