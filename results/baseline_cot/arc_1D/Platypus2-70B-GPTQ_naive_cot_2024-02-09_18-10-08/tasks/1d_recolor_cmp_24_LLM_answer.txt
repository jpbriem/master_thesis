prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the difference between the input and output sequence, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'transformation': {'input': 'copy the test case input sequence from the task. Mind the sequence length!', 'object_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequences, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'create the resulting test output sequence. Mind the sequence length!'}, 'test_output': 'Return the created test output sequence in numpy array format. Mind the sequence length!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


### Instruction:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9]



Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Sample Outputs:

{'description': {'Example_1': 'In this example, we see two groups of nine consecutive nines (9). In the second group, each number is replaced by a two (2) while keeping their order.', 'Example_2': 'In this example, there are three groups of numbers. The first group consists of one nine (9), the second group has four nines (9), and the third group also contains four nines (9). In the result, the first group remains unchanged, but the other two groups are replaced by twos (2).', 'Example_3': 'Here, we can observe five groups of numbers. The first group has six nines (9), followed by another group with three nines (9). Afterward, there are two more groups consisting of three nines (9) each, and finally, one last group containing two nines (9). In the result, the first group stays intact, whereas the remaining ones get substituted with twos (2).'}, 'overall_pattern': 'For every group of at least two identical numbers, replace them with half as many smaller numbers. If there is only one number in a group, leave it untouched.', 'instructions': 'To apply this rule to an input sequence, follow these steps: \n\n1. Identify any groups of at least two identical numbers.\n2. Replace each group with half as many smaller numbers.\n3. If there is only one number in a group, do nothing.\n\nFinal Step:\n\n4. Return the modified output sequence.'}
