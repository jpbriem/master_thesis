            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[1, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8], [1, 1, 7, 7, 1, 8], [7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8]]\noutput: [[1, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8], [1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 8]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[7, 7, 7, 1], [1, 8, 1, 7], [7, 1, 1, 7]]\noutput: [[5, 5, 5, 1], [1, 8, 1, 5], [5, 1, 1, 5]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[1, 8, 1, 7, 1], [7, 8, 8, 1, 1], [7, 1, 8, 8, 7]]\noutput: [[1, 8, 1, 5, 1], [5, 8, 8, 1, 1], [5, 1, 8, 8, 5]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[1, 7, 7, 1, 7], [8, 1, 7, 7, 7], [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'the value of each pixel has been decreased by 3', 'object_changes': 'all objects (colors other than 0) have changed their color to the new value obtained after subtracting 3 from the original value'} , 'example_2_description': {...} , 'example_3_description': {...} , 'overall_pattern': 'subtract 3 from the value of each non-zero pixel' , 'instructions': ['for each pixel in the input grid' , 'if the value of the pixel is greater than 0' , 'subtract 3 from the value of that pixel'] , 'test_case_input_copy': [[1, 7, 7, 1, 7], [8, 1, 7, 7, 7], [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]] , 'test_case_grid_view': 'the grid contains three rows and five columns. there are two distinct colors present in the grid: 1 and 7. the top row starts with a 1, followed by three consecutive 7s, then another 1. the second row begins with an 8, followed by a 1, three consecutive 7s, and finally another 8. the bottom row mirrors the arrangement of the top row, but flipped horizontally. the middle column consists entirely of 7s.' , 'test_case_object_view': 'there are two objects present in the grid: one with color 1 and one with color 7. both objects occupy four cells in total. the object with color 1 is located in the top left corner of the grid, while the object with color 7 occupies most of the rest of the grid.' , 'test_case_transformation': 'subtract 3 from the value of every non-zero pixel in the input grid' , 'test_case_output': np.array([[1, 4, 4, 1, 4], [5, 1, 4, 4, 5], [5, 4, 1, 4, 5]]) }"
