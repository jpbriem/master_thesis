            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nExample_4:\ninput: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'the background has changed from black (value 0) to white (value 1), while the foreground has changed from white to black.', 'object_changes': 'there is no change in the number of objects, but their positions have been swapped - they moved from the center to the corners, and vice versa.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'the background has changed from black (value 0) to white (value 1), while the foreground has changed from white to black.', 'object_changes': 'there is no change in the number of objects, but their positions have been swapped - they moved from the center to the corners, and vice versa.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'the background remains unchanged, while there is a shift in the position of the foreground object.', 'object_changes': 'there is no change in the number of objects, but the object moves from right-bottom corner to left-top corner.'}, 'example_4_description': {'pixel_changes': 'the background remains unchanged, while there is a shift in the position of the foreground object.', 'object_changes': 'there is no change in the number of objects, but the object moves from bottom-center to top-center.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'the overall pattern involves swapping the positions of the foreground and background, and/or shifting the position of the foreground object. depending on the initial arrangement, this may result in a flip or rotation of the image.', 'instructions': 'to perform the transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1. identify the foreground and background colors in the input grid.\n2. if necessary, swap the positions of the foreground and background colors so that the background is now in the corners and the foreground is centered.\n3. if necessary, shift the position of the foreground object to the opposite corner.\n4. ensure that any remaining areas of the grid that were previously unoccupied remain blank.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'the input grid consists of two distinct regions - a larger region filled with value 2, and smaller regions filled with value 0.', 'test_case_object_view': 'there are two objects present in the input grid - one large rectangle with color 2, and several small rectangles with color 0. the large rectangle occupies the central area of the grid, while the small rectangles occupy the outer edges.', 'test_case_transformation': 'in order to produce the expected output, we need to swap the positions of the foreground and background colors, and then move the foreground object to the opposite corner. specifically, we will:\n\n1. set all cells currently filled with value 2 to value 0.\n2. set all cells currently filled with value 0 to value 2.\n3. move the largest contiguous region of value 2 (i.e., the foreground object) to the upper-left corner of the grid.', 'test_case_output': np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0]])}"
