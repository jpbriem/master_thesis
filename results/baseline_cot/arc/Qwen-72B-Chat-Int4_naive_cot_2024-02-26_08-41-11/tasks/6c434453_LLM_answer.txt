prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input pixels are modified by changing their values according to certain rules. Specifically, every instance of value '1' in the input grid has been replaced with '2'. Additionally, some instances of '1' have been converted to other numbers (e.g., '1' to '0', '1' to '1') depending on their position relative to other pixels.",
        "object_changes": "Regarding the objects, there seems to be no change in terms of color, size, or shape. However, some objects have moved due to the modification of surrounding pixels."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "Similar to the previous example, the input pixels are modified here too. In particular, each occurrence of the value '1' is replaced with '2'. Furthermore, some instances of '1' have been changed to other numbers (e.g., '1' to '0', '1' to '2') based on their location relative to neighboring pixels.",
        "object_changes": "There appears to be no significant difference in the objects themselves - they maintain the same color, size, and shape. Nevertheless, some objects have shifted positions due to modifications made to nearby pixels."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "A common theme across both input-output pairs is that all occurrences of the value '1' in the input grids are systematically altered to '2'. Moreover, specific instances of '1' may undergo further changes based on their spatial relationships with neighboring pixels. This suggests an algorithmic approach where the transformation function focuses on modifying instances of '1' while considering their contextual positioning.",
    "instructions": [
        "Step 1: Identify all occurrences of the value '1' in the input grid.",
        "Step 2: Replace these occurrences with the value '2'.",
        "Step 3: Iterate through the modified grid and identify any instances of '1' whose neighbors were originally '1' in the input grid.",
        "Step 4: Modify those instances based on their neighbor's original value in the input grid. For example, if a cell had a neighbor with the value '1' in the input grid, convert it to '0'; if it had a neighbor with the value '0', convert it to '2'.",

    "<test_case_object_view>": "There seem to be multiple disconnected objects present in the test input grid. Their colors vary between '0', '1', and '2', and their sizes range from small singularities to larger clusters. These objects exhibit irregular shapes, but none of them overlap or touch each other directly.",
    "<test_case_transformation>": "To apply the learned transformation pattern, we need to follow the steps outlined earlier. First, we will modify all instances of the value '1' to '2'. Next, we iterate through the modified grid and identify any cells that were previously surrounded by '1' values in the input grid. We then update these cells accordingly, converting them to either '0' or '2' based on whether their neighbors were initially '0' or '1'. Finally, we return the transformed grid as our output.",
