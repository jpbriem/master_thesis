The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 8, 1]]\noutput: [[1, 8, 2], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[9, 2, 4], [2, 4, 4], [2, 9, 2]]\noutput: [[2, 9, 2], [4, 4, 2], [4, 2, 9]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[8, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5]]\noutput: [[5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8]]\n\nExample_4:\ninput: [[3, 2, 9], [9, 9, 9], [2, 3, 3]]\noutput: [[3, 3, 2], [9, 9, 9], [9, 2, 3]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[6, 4, 4], [6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 7]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given information, I understand that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid using a series of arithmetical operations. The transformations involve changing the color of individual pixels or groups of pixels, as well as moving or resizing objects within the grid.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will need to perform the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Understand the Input Grid\nI will carefully examine the input grid and identify the individual pixels, their colors, and any objects present in the grid.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Transformation Pattern\nI will analyze the input grid and determine the pattern of transformation that is applied to each pixel and object in the grid. This may involve identifying lines, rectangles, or other geometric shapes that are used to transform the grid.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Transformation\nUsing the understanding of the transformation pattern, I will apply the necessary arithmetical operations to each pixel and object in the input grid to produce the corresponding output grid. This may involve simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, as well as more complex operations involving matrices or other mathematical structures.\n\nStep 4: Validate the Output\nOnce I have produced the output grid, I will verify that it matches the expected output based on the given examples. If there are any discrepancies, I will adjust my solution accordingly.\n\nBased on the provided examples, the transformation pattern appears to involve changing the color of individual pixels or groups of pixels, as well as moving or resizing objects within the grid. The exact nature of the transformation will depend on the specific input grid and the desired output.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the given input grid:\n```json\n{\n\"example_1_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"The input grid contains three objects: two rectangles and a square. The rectangle on the top left has a size of 4x4 pixels and is colored blue, while the rectangle on the bottom right has a size of 3x3 pixels and is colored red. The square in the middle has a size of 2x2 pixels and is colored green.\",\n\"object_changes\": \"The objects in the input grid are moved and resized according to the transformation pattern. The blue rectangle on the top left is moved to the bottom right and increased in size to 5x5 pixels, while the red rectangle on the bottom right is moved to the top left and decreased in size to 2x2 pixels. The green square remains unchanged.\"\n},\n\"example_2_description\": {},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"The transformation pattern involves applying a combination of line, rectangle, and object transformations to the input grid.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Apply the transformation pattern to the input grid to produce the corresponding output grid.\",\n\"test_case_input_copy\": \"[6, 4, 4], [6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 7]\",\n\"test_case_grid_view\": \"The input grid consists of 9 pixels arranged in a 3x3 matrix.
