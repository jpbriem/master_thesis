The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]\noutput: [[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0]]\noutput: [[6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9], [9, 9, 9]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9]]\n\nExample_4:\ninput: [[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2]]\noutput: [[2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given information, I understand that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid, while applying various geometric and topological operations. The transformations can involve changing the shape, size, color, and position of the pixels and objects in the grid.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Understand the Input Grid\nI will carefully examine the input grid and identify the objects present in it. I will also note the color palette used in the grid, including the background color and the colors used for each object.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Transformation Pattern\nI will analyze the input grid and determine the underlying transformation pattern that is applied to it. This may involve identifying lines, rectangles, circles, or other shapes in the grid, as well as their orientations and positions.\n\nStep 3: Develop a Transformation Plan\nBased on the identified transformation pattern, I will create a plan outlining the specific actions needed to transform the input grid into the desired output grid. This plan may involve scaling, rotating, flipping, or moving objects in the grid, as well as changing their colors and sizes.\n\nStep 4: Apply the Transformation Plan\nUsing the developed plan, I will apply the necessary transformations to the input grid to produce the desired output grid. I will ensure that the colors, shapes, and positions of the objects in the grid are consistent with the transformation pattern.\n\nStep 5: Validate the Output\nOnce the transformation has been applied, I will validate the output grid to ensure that it matches the expected output. I will compare the output grid with the provided examples to ensure that the transformation has been successful.\n\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the input-output pairs you provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]\nOutput: [[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]\nDescription: The input grid consists of three rows and three columns of pixels, with each pixel having a value of either 0 or 9. The transformation involves copying the entire grid without any changes.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [[6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0]]\nOutput: [[6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6]]\nDescription: The input grid consists of three rows and three columns of pixels, with each pixel having a value of either 0 or 6. The transformation involves duplicating the middle row and column twice, while keeping the top and bottom rows and columns unchanged.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [[0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9], [9, 9, 9]]\nOutput: [[9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9]]\nDescription: The input grid consists of three rows and three columns of pixels, with each pixel having a value of either 0 or 9. The transformation involves reflecting the entire grid horizontally across the central axis.\n\nExample 4:\nInput: [[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2]]\nOutput: [[2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0]]\nDescription: The input grid consists of three rows and three columns of pixels, with each pixel having a value of either 0 or 2. The transformation involves rotating the grid clockwise by 90 degrees.\n\nOverall Pattern:\nThe overall pattern observed in these examples is that the transformation involves modifying the shape, size, color, and position of the objects in the grid, often through geometric and topological operations such as scaling, rotation, flipping, and reflection."
