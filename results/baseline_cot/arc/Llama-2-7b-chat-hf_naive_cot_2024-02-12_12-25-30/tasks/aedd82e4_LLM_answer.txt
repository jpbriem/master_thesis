You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [2, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [1, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
output: [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2]]
output: [[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2]]

Example_4:
input: [[2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0]]
output: [[2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[2, 2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this problem.

Based on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid, where each pixel value is related to the corresponding pixel in the input grid through a mathematical operation. The operations allowed are:

* Lines: The distance between two adjacent pixels in the output grid is equal to the distance between their corresponding pixels in the input grid.
* Rectangles: The area of a rectangle in the output grid is proportional to the area of the corresponding rectangle in the input grid.
* Mirroring: Reflecting an object in the output grid across a vertical line.
* Rotation: Rotating an object in the output grid around its center by a certain angle.
* Scaling: Resizing an object in the output grid by a factor relative to its size in the input grid.
* Elastic distortion: Stretching or compressing an object in the output grid by a factor relative to its size in the input grid.
* Containment: Checking whether a pixel in the output grid contains another pixel from the input grid.
* Being contained: Checking whether a pixel in the output grid is contained within another pixel from the input grid.
* Outside: Checking whether a pixel in the output grid is located outside of any pixel from the input grid.

For each input-output pair, you need to provide a description of the changes made to the pixels and objects in the output grid compared to the input grid. You also need to specify the instructions for the transformation, including any conditional statements.

Here are the examples provided in the problem statement:

Example 1:
Input: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [2, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [1, 0, 0]]
Description: The objects in the output grid are identical to those in the input grid, but their positions have been shifted by one pixel in the x-direction.
Instructions: Perform a horizontal mirroring operation on the input grid.

Example 2:
Input: [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
Output: [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]
Description: The objects in the output grid are the same as those in the input grid, but their sizes have been reduced by half.
Instructions: Apply a scaling operation to the input grid with a factor of 0.5 in both the x and y directions.

Example 3:
Input: [[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
Output: [[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]
Description: The objects in the output grid are the same as those in the input grid, but their orientations have been flipped.
Instructions: Apply a rotation operation to the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise.

Example 4:
Input: [[2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0]]
Output: [[2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]
Description: The objects in the output grid are the same as those in the input grid, but their positions have been swapped.
Instructions: Perform a vertical mirroring operation on the input grid.

I hope this helps you understand the problem better. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
