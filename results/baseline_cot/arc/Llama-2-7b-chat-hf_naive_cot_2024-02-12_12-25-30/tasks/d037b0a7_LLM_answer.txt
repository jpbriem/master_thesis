[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [7, 2, 8]]

Example_3:
input: [[4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [4, 2, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[4, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Based on the given information, I understand that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid, while applying various geometric and topological operations. The transformations can involve lines, rectangles, symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, upscaling, downscaling, elastic distortions, containing, being contained, and touching objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels and arithmetical operations based on objects or shapes.

To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

Step 1: Understand the Input Grid
I will carefully examine the input grid and identify the objects present in it. I will also note the colors of each object, their sizes, coordinates, and any other relevant details.

Step 2: Identify the Transformation Pattern
I will analyze the input grid and determine the underlying transformation pattern that is applied to it. This may involve identifying lines, rectangles, symmetry axes, and other geometric elements that are used in the transformation.

Step 3: Apply the Transformation
Using the identified transformation pattern, I will apply the necessary operations to the input grid to produce the corresponding output grid. This may involve using mathematical operations such as scaling, rotation, translation, and projection, as well as more complex operations such as elastic deformations and noise addition.

Step 4: Describe the Output Grid
Once the transformation has been applied, I will describe the resulting output grid in detail. This will include identifying the objects present in the grid, their colors, sizes, coordinates, and any other relevant details.

Step 5: Provide Instructions
Based on the observed transformation pattern, I will provide detailed instructions on how to perform the transformation for any given input grid. These instructions will cover the specific operations that need to be performed, as well as any constraints or limitations that must be taken into account.

Step 6: Test Cases
Finally, I will provide test cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. These test cases will involve providing different input grids and observing how they are transformed into the corresponding output grids.

Here are the requested outputs for the provided test case:

'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'The input grid contains three objects: two rectangles and a line. The line is stretched horizontally, and both rectangles are scaled up by a factor of 2.', 'object_changes': 'The two rectangles are scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, and the line is stretched horizontally by a factor of 2.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[4, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'The entire grid consists of alternating dark and light pixels, with no discernible pattern.', 'test_case_object_view': 'There are three objects in the grid: two rectangles and a line. The rectangles are colored blue and green, respectively, and the line is colored red.', 'test_case_transformation': 'Stretch the horizontal axis of the line by a factor of 2, and scale up both rectangles by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.', 'test_case_output': '[[4, 0, 16], [0, 0, 0], [0, 14, 0]]'}

For the remaining test cases, please provide the input grids, and I will generate the corresponding description fields accordingly.
