The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

The grid has a total of 64 pixels, including the border pixels. The color palette includes 10 distinct hues, each represented by a unique range of pixel values.\n\nOutput Grid:\nThe output grid also consists of 8x8 pixels, with each pixel value ranging from 0 to 9. However, unlike the input grid, the output grid has undergone a geometric transformation, causing the pixels to be shifted and scaled. Specifically, the x-axis and y-axis have been stretched by factors of 2 and 3, respectively, while maintaining their original proportions. As a result, the output grid has a different spatial arrangement than the input grid.\n\nLogical Pattern:\nThe logical pattern governing the transformation involves various geometric and topological operations, such as line segments, rectangle formation, and symmetry breaking. These operations are applied recursively across multiple scales, leading to complex patterns that exhibit self-similarity and fractal properties.\n\nInstructions:\nBased on the above analysis, you are expected to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Apply a series of geometric transformations to the input grid, including rotation, scaling, translation, and reflection. These transformations should follow specific rules and patterns, such as applying identical transformations to neighboring pixels or using certain pixels as reference points.\n2. After applying the transformations, merge adjacent pixels with similar color values into larger objects. Each object should have a unique identifier and color code based on its position and size.\n3. Eliminate any redundant or unnecessary objects, ensuring that only meaningful patterns remain in the output grid.\n4. Output the resulting grid as a JSON object, containing information about the transformed pixels, objects, and their properties.\n\nRegarding the first example, you are asked to describe the changes between the input and output grids regarding the 2D transformation rules. Please provide detailed explanations of the transformations applied to each pixel and object, highlighting the symmetries and patterns involved."
