You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]

Example_4:
input: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2]]



Test case:
input: [[2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this problem.

Based on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid, while applying some mathematical operations on the pixels. The operations could include geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation, translation, and deformation, as well as arithmetical operations such as counting, sorting, and combining pixels based on their color or proximity to each other.

To start, let's analyze the given examples:

Example 1:
Input: [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]

In this example, the input grid has three rows and three columns, and each pixel value ranges from 1 to 3. The output grid also has three rows and three columns, but the pixel values are all 0, except for the top-left corner pixel which is 1. It appears that the transformation is simply copying the input grid and replacing all pixel values with 0.

Example 2:
Input: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]

This example is similar to the previous one, but the output grid has two rows and three columns instead of three rows and three columns. Again, the transformation appears to be copying the input grid and replacing all pixel values with 0.

Example 3:
Input: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]

In this example, the input grid has three rows and three columns, and each pixel value ranges from 0 to 2. The output grid also has three rows and three columns, but the pixel values are shifted by one unit in the x-axis direction. It seems that the transformation is simply shifting the input grid by one unit in the x-axis direction.

Example 4:
Input: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2]]

This example is similar to the previous one, but the output grid has two rows and three columns instead of three rows and three columns. Again, the transformation appears to be shifting the input grid by one unit in the x-axis direction.

Now, let's move on to the test case:

Input: [[2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

From the given examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves copying the input grid and replacing all pixel values with 0. Therefore, the output grid for the test case would be:

Output: [[0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

So, the required transformation action is simply copying the input grid without changing any of the pixel values.
