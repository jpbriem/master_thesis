The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'd be happy to help you with this task. Here's my understanding of the task based on the information provided:\n\n* We have a set of input-output pairs, each consisting of a 2D grid of pixels.\n* Each input grid has a fixed size of 2x5 pixels, with each pixel having a value from 1 to 9 representing a specific color.\n* Each output grid also has a fixed size of 2x5 pixels, but the values may change from the original input grid.\n* There is a logical pattern that relates the input and output grids, which involves geometric and topological transformations such as lines, rectangles, and symmetry.\n* The goal is to infer the relation between the input and output grids and describe the changes made to the pixels and objects in the grid.\n\nTo begin, let me describe the input and output grids for the first example:\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```\n[2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n[0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAs we can see, there are several differences between the input and output grids. Some of the key changes include:\n\n* All pixels have been flipped horizontally, so the top row is now at the bottom and vice versa.\n* Pixels with value 2 have been replaced with pixels of value 1.\n* Pixels with value 0 have been removed.\n\nNow, let me describe the input and output grids for the second example:\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nSome of the key changes in this example include:\n\n* All pixels have been flipped vertically, so the top column is now at the bottom and vice versa.\n* Pixels with value 2 have been replaced with pixels of value 1.\n* Pixels with value 0 have been removed.\n\nFinally, here is the input grid for the third example:\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAnd here is the output grid for this example:\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n[1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nAs we can see, there are no significant changes between the input and output grids for this example.\n\nBased on these examples, it appears that the transformation pattern involves flipping pixels horizontally or vertically, replacing pixels with different values, and removing pixels with value 0. However, the exact rules governing these transformations are not explicitly stated, so we must rely on our understanding of the given examples to make predictions about future inputs."
