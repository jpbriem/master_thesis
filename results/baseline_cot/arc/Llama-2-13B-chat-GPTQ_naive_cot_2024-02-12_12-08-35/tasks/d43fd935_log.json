The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]]\noutput: [[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'm here to help you with your task. Based on the provided examples and instructions, I understand that you need to transform an input grid of pixels into an output grid using specific rules. Here's my understanding of the task so far:\n\n* The input grid has dimensions (2, 5), and each element is either 0 (representing the background color) or a number between 1 and 9 (representing different pixel colors).\n* The output grid should also have dimensions (2, 5), and each element should be transformed according to certain rules based on the input grid.\n* The transformation involves objects, which are defined as groups of adjacent pixels with the same color. Objects can move, resize, or change color, but their overall shape and connectivity must be preserved.\n* The transformation also involves symmetry, mirroring, rotations, and other geometric operations.\n\nTo begin, I will provide a brief description of the input and output grids, followed by a more detailed explanation of the transformation rules. Finally, I will provide the output grid for each example.\n\nInput Grid Description:\n\n* Input grid has dimensions (2, 5) with 10 elements in total.\n* Each element is either 0 (background color) or a number between 1 and 9 (pixel color).\n\nOutput Grid Description:\n\n* Output grid should also have dimensions (2, 5) with 10 elements in total.\n* Each element should be transformed according to the given rules based on the input grid.\n\nTransformation Rules:\n\n1. Objects:\n\t* Objects are defined as groups of adjacent pixels with the same color.\n\t* Objects can move, resize, or change color, but their overall shape and connectivity must be preserved.\n2. Symmetry and Mirroring:\n\t* Objects may be reflected, rotated, or otherwise symmetrized.\n3. Geometric Operations:\n\t* Objects may be resized, moved, or deformed using geometric operations such as scaling, shearing, or affine transformations.\n4. Color Changes:\n\t* Pixels may change color based on the input grid.\n\nNow, let me provide the output grid for each example:\n\nExample 1 Output:\n\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 2 Output:\n\n[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 3 Output:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps!
