The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 8, 1]]\noutput: [[1, 8, 2], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[9, 2, 4], [2, 4, 4], [2, 9, 2]]\noutput: [[2, 9, 2], [4, 4, 2], [4, 2, 9]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[8, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5]]\noutput: [[5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8]]\n\nExample_4:\ninput: [[3, 2, 9], [9, 9, 9], [2, 3, 3]]\noutput: [[3, 3, 2], [9, 9, 9], [9, 2, 3]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[6, 4, 4], [6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 7]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my analysis of the given input-output pairs and the overall pattern they share:\n\n1. Example_1:\n\nInput: [[2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 8, 1]]\nOutput: [[1, 8, 2], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]]\n\nPattern: Each pixel in the input grid has been replaced by the value of the corresponding pixel in the output grid, shifted by one position horizontally and vertically. This creates a \"mirror\" effect, where the top row of the input grid becomes the bottom row of the output grid, and vice versa.\n\n2. Example_2:\n\nInput: [[9, 2, 4], [2, 4, 4], [2, 9, 2]]\nOutput: [[2, 9, 2], [4, 4, 2], [4, 2, 9]]\n\nPattern: Similar to Example_1, but this time the shifting is done in a more complex way. Pixels in the input grid are replaced by the corresponding pixels in the output grid, but with some adjustments based on the symmetry of the grid. Specifically, each pixel in the input grid is replaced by the value of the corresponding pixel in the output grid, shifted by one position horizontally and vertically, but also flipped over the central vertical line.\n\n3. Example_3:\n\nInput: [[8, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5]]\nOutput: [[5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8]]\n\nPattern: In this example, the transformation seems to simply copy the input grid onto the output grid, without any apparent shifts or adjustments. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the output grid has been scaled up by a factor of 2 in both the horizontal and vertical directions, while maintaining the same relative positions of the pixels.\n\n4. Example_4:\n\nInput: [[3, 2, 9], [9, 9, 9], [2, 3, 3]]\nOutput: [[3, 3, 2], [9, 9, 9], [9, 2, 3]]\n\nPattern: This example shares some similarities with Example_1, but with additional twists. Pixels in the input grid are replaced by the corresponding pixels in the output grid, but with some adjustments based on the symmetry of the grid. Specifically, each pixel in the input grid is replaced by the value of the corresponding pixel in the output grid, shifted by one position horizontally and vertically, but also flipped over the central vertical line. Additionally, some pixels in the output grid have been swapped with their neighbors, creating a more complex pattern.\n\nOverall Pattern: All of these examples share a common pattern of transformation, which involves shifting and/or scaling the input grid to create the output grid. The specific transformations used in each example are a combination of simple shifts, reflections, and rescaling.\n\nNow, let me describe the required transformation actions in detail, step by step, for the given test case input grid:\n\nTest Case Input: [[6, 4, 4], [6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 7]]\n\nStep 1: Reflect the input grid across the central vertical line, so that the top row becomes the bottom row and vice versa.\n\nStep 2: Scale the reflected grid by a factor of 2 in the horizontal direction, so that each pixel in the grid is moved twice as far to the right as it was originally.\n\nStep 3: Scale the reflected and scaled grid by a factor of 2 in the vertical direction, so that each pixel in the grid is moved twice as far down as it was originally.\n\nStep 4: Replace each pixel in the grid with the corresponding pixel in the output grid, shifted by one position horizontally and vertically.\n\nHere's the resulting output grid as a numpy array:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Output grid\noutput = np.array([\n    [6, 4, 4],\n    [6, 6, 4],\n    [4, 6, 7]\n])\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
