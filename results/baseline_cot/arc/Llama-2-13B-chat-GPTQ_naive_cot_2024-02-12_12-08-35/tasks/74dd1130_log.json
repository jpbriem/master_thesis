The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[2, 2, 1], [1, 5, 1], [5, 2, 2]]\noutput: [[2, 1, 5], [2, 5, 2], [1, 1, 2]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[2, 2, 5], [6, 2, 2], [5, 5, 5]]\noutput: [[2, 6, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 2, 5]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[9, 9, 5], [5, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]\noutput: [[9, 5, 5], [9, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]\n\nExample_4:\ninput: [[2, 6, 6], [2, 1, 1], [2, 6, 2]]\noutput: [[2, 2, 2], [6, 1, 6], [6, 1, 2]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my analysis of the given input-output pairs and the overall pattern they share:\n\n1. Example_1:\n\nInput: [[2, 2, 1], [1, 5, 1], [5, 2, 2]]\nOutput: [[2, 1, 5], [2, 5, 2], [1, 1, 2]]\n\nPattern: Each object is moved one position in a clockwise direction, maintaining its original size and shape. The background color is changed to the opposite color of the object.\n\n2. Example_2:\n\nInput: [[2, 2, 5], [6, 2, 2], [5, 5, 5]]\nOutput: [[2, 6, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 2, 5]]\n\nPattern: Each object is scaled up by a factor of two in both x and y directions, while maintaining its original color. The background color is changed to the opposite color of the object.\n\n3. Example_3:\n\nInput: [[9, 9, 5], [5, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]\nOutput: [[9, 5, 5], [9, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]\n\nPattern: Each object is resized to double its original size, while maintaining its original shape and color. The background color is changed to the opposite color of the object.\n\n4. Example_4:\n\nInput: [[2, 6, 6], [2, 1, 1], [2, 6, 2]]\nOutput: [[2, 2, 2], [6, 1, 6], [6, 1, 2]]\n\nPattern: Each object is rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees, while maintaining its original size and shape. The background color is changed to the opposite color of the object.\n\nOverall Pattern: All input-output pairs share a common pattern where each object is transformed in some way, such as moving, scaling, resizing, or rotating, while maintaining its original color and shape. The background color is always changed to the opposite color of the object.\n\nNow, let me describe the required transformation actions in detail, step by step:\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input grid based on their color. Objects are defined as groups of adjacent pixels of the same color.\n\nStep 2: For each object, perform the following operations:\n\na. Move the object one position in a clockwise direction, maintaining its original size and shape.\n\nb. Change the background color to the opposite color of the object.\n\nc. Scale the object up by a factor of two in both x and y directions, maintaining its original shape and color.\n\nd. Resize the object to double its original size, while maintaining its original shape and color.\n\ne. Rotate the object counterclockwise by 90 degrees, while maintaining its original size and shape.\n\nStep 3: Output the resulting transformed grid.\n\nHere's the test case input copy: [[9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4]]\n\nAnd here's the test case grid view:\n\nGrid View:\n\n| 9 | 3 | 4 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 | 4 | 4 |\n| 3 | 4 | 4 |\n\nObject View:\n\nObject 1: {color: '9', coordinates: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)]}\nObject 2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]}\nObject 3: {color: '4', coordinates: [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]}\n\nNow, please provide the actual input grid, and I will apply the described transformation steps to produce the output grid."
