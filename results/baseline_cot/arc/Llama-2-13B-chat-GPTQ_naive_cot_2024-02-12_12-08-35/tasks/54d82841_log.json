The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'd be happy to help you with this task. Here's my understanding of the task based on the information provided:\n\n* We have three examples of input-output pairs, each representing a different transformation pattern.\n* The input grid is a 2D array of integers representing pixel colors, with dimensions (m, n).\n* Each output grid is also a 2D array of integers representing pixel colors, with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n* The goal is to transform the input grid into the corresponding output grid using a specific transformation pattern.\n* The transformation pattern involves geometric and topological features such as lines, rectangles, and symmetry.\n* Objects in the grid are defined as groups of adjacent pixels with the same color.\n* The transformation may involve copying, repeating, scaling, rotating, translating, and flipping objects.\n\nBased on these requirements, here's what I would do to solve the task:\n\n1. First, I would carefully examine each example input-output pair to understand the specific transformation pattern involved.\n2. Next, I would create a Python function that takes an input grid as a 2D NumPy array and applies the appropriate transformation pattern to produce the output grid.\n3. For each example, I would manually write out the steps involved in the transformation process, including any necessary adjustments to the input grid before applying the transformation pattern.\n4. Once I have written out the transformation steps for each example, I would copy and paste them into a JSON file with the appropriate keys and values.\n5. Finally, I would run through each example and verify that the output grid produced by the transformation pattern matches the expected output grid.\n\nHere's an example of how the final JSON file might look like:\n```json\n{\n\"example_1_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"Regarding the first example, the main change is the rotation of the objects by 90 degrees clockwise.\",\n\"object_changes\": \"The objects have been resized and moved around, but their colors and shapes remain the same.\"\n},\n\"example_2_description\": {\"ellipsis\"}\n\"overall_pattern\": \"The overall pattern is a combination of rotations, reflections, and scaling.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Apply the transformation pattern to the input grid, taking care to preserve the object boundaries and maintain the correct orientation of the objects.\",\n\"test_case_input_copy\": \"Copy the test case input grid from the task\",\n\"test_case_grid_view\": \"Regarding the test input, the grid consists of various objects with different colors and shapes, arranged in a seemingly random pattern.\",\n\"test_case_object_view\": \"The objects in the grid are well-defined and have distinct borders, but they are not necessarily symmetrical or perfectly aligned.\",\n\"test_case_transformation\": \"The transformation pattern involves rotating, reflecting, and scaling the objects to produce the desired output grid.\",\n\"test_case_output\": \"Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array.\"\n}\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with the task."
