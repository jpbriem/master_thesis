[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 8], [2, 8, 8]]
output: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 5, 5], [2, 5, 5]]

Example_2:
input: [[1, 1, 1], [8, 1, 3], [8, 2, 2]]
output: [[1, 1, 1], [5, 1, 5], [5, 5, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 2], [2, 2, 2]]
output: [[2, 2, 2], [5, 5, 2], [2, 2, 2]]

Example_4:
input: [[3, 3, 8], [4, 4, 4], [8, 1, 1]]
output: [[5, 5, 5], [4, 4, 4], [5, 5, 5]]



Test case:
input: [[1, 3, 2], [3, 3, 2], [1, 3, 2]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my analysis of the given input-output pairs and the overall pattern they share:

1. Example_1:

Input: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 8], [2, 8, 8]]
Output: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 5, 5], [2, 5, 5]]

Pattern: Each pixel value is doubled, except for the middle row where each pixel value is increased by 1.

2. Example_2:

Input: [[1, 1, 1], [8, 1, 3], [8, 2, 2]]
Output: [[1, 1, 1], [5, 1, 5], [5, 5, 5]]

Pattern: Each pixel value is multiplied by 2, except for the first column where each pixel value is incremented by 1.

3. Example_3:

Input: [[2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 2], [2, 2, 2]]
Output: [[2, 2, 2], [5, 5, 2], [2, 2, 2]]

Pattern: Each pixel value is doubled, except for the last row where each pixel value is incremented by 2.

4. Example_4:

Input: [[3, 3, 8], [4, 4, 4], [8, 1, 1]]
Output: [[5, 5, 5], [4, 4, 4], [5, 5, 5]]

Pattern: Each pixel value is replaced by the value 5.

Overall pattern: All input-output pairs share a common pattern of modifying pixel values based on certain rules. These rules involve either doubling or multiplying pixel values, or replacing them with specific values. The rules are applied independently to each row or column of the grid, depending on the specific example.

Now, let me analyze the given test case:

Input: [[1, 3, 2], [3, 3, 2], [1, 3, 2]]

Based on the above pattern, here's what we need to do to transform this input grid:

1. Double each pixel value in the first row.
2. Increment each pixel value in the second row by 1.
3. Double each pixel value in the third row.

So, the output grid would look like this:

Output: [[2, 6, 4], [3, 4, 5], [2, 6, 4]]

Here's the complete JSON response:

{
"example_1_description": {"pixel_changes": "Each pixel value is doubled.", "object_changes": "No objects."},
"example_2_description": {"pixel_changes": "Each pixel value is multiplied by 2.", "object_changes": "No objects."},
"overall_pattern": "Modify pixel values based on certain rules, independent of rows or columns.",
"instructions": "Double each pixel value in the first row, increment each pixel value in the second row by 1, and double each pixel value in the third row.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[1, 3, 2], [3, 3, 2], [1, 3, 2]",
"test_case_grid_view": "Grid view of the input: [[1, 3, 2], [3, 3, 2], [1, 3, 2]]",
"test_case_object_view": "No objects.",
"test_case_transformation": "Transform the input grid according to the instructions: double each pixel value in the first row, increment each pixel value in the second row by 1, and double each pixel value in the third row.",
"test_case_output": "[2, 6, 4], [3, 4, 5], [2, 6, 4]"
}
