You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this task.

So, let me understand the task correctly - we have an input grid of pixels, and we need to transform it into an output grid of pixels based on certain rules. The input and output grids both have values from 1 to 9, representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid.

I see that there are three examples provided, each with their own input and output grids. The first example has a simple transformation where each pixel is replaced by the average value of the surrounding pixels. The second example has a more complex transformation where objects are moved around and resized. The third example has a combination of rotation, scaling, and flipping.

To start, I will analyze the input grid and identify any patterns or objects present in the grid. Based on the examples provided, I will then apply the appropriate transformation to the input grid to produce the desired output grid.

Here's the input grid you provided:
```markdown
input: [[7, 6, 1], [6, 7, 6], [6, 2, 2]]
```
Let me break down the grid into its constituent parts:

* First row: `[7, 6, 1]`
	+ Object 1: `{color: '7', coordinates: [(0,0), (1,0)], size: 2}`
	+ Object 2: `{color: '6', coordinates: [(1,1)], size: 1}`
	+ Object 3: `{color: '1', coordinates: [(2,0)], size: 1}`
* Second row: `[6, 7, 6]`
	+ Object 1: `{color: '6', coordinates: [(0,1), (1,1)], size: 2}`
	+ Object 2: `{color: '7', coordinates: [(1,0)], size: 1}`
* Third row: `[6, 2, 2]`
	+ Object 1: `{color: '6', coordinates: [(0,2)], size: 2}`
	+ Object 2: `{color: '2', coordinates: [(1,2)], size: 1}`

Based on the examples provided, I will now apply the appropriate transformation to the input grid. For the first example, I will replace each pixel with the average value of the surrounding pixels. For the second example, I will move and resize objects based on their coordinates and sizes. For the third example, I will rotate, scale, and flip objects based on their coordinates and sizes.

Here's the resulting output grid after applying the transformations:
```markdown
output: [[2, 6, 6], [2, 6, 1], [2, 2, 7], [2, 2, 1], [7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7], [7, 1, 7], [1, 7, 7]]
```
As requested, here are the descriptions of the changes between the input and output grids:

* Pixels: The input grid contains pixels with values from 1 to 9, while the output grid contains pixels with values from 1 to 7.
* Objects: The input grid contains several objects with specific colors, coordinates, and sizes, while the output grid contains new objects with different colors, coordinates, and sizes.
* Patterns: The input grid exhibits a checkerboard pattern, while the output grid exhibits a diamond pattern.

Regarding the instructions, I will follow these steps to transform the input grid into the output grid:

1. Identify objects in the input grid based on their colors and coordinates.
2. Apply the appropriate transformation to each object based on its color, size, and coordinates.
3. Combine the transformed objects to create the final output grid.

Finally, here's the resulting JSON object with the requested information:
```json
{
"example_1_description": {"pixel_changes": "replaced each pixel with the average value of the surrounding pixels", "object_changes": "moved and resized objects based on their coordinates and sizes"},
"example_2_description": {"pixel_changes": "rotated, scaled, and flipped pixels based on their coordinates and sizes", "object_changes": "moved and resized objects based on their coordinates and sizes"},
"example_3_description": {"pixel_changes": "rotated, scaled, and flipped pixels based on their coordinates and sizes", "object_changes": "moved and resized objects based on their coordinates and sizes"},
"overall_pattern": "created a diamond pattern from a checkerboard pattern",
"instructions": "apply the appropriate transformation to each object based on its color, size, and coordinates",

"test_case_object_view": "objects with specific colors, coordinates, and sizes",
"test_case_transformation": "replace pixels with the average value of the surrounding pixels, move and resize objects based on their coordinates and sizes",
"test_case_output": "[2, 6, 6], [2, 6, 1], [2, 2, 7], [2, 2, 1], [7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7], [7, 1, 7], [1, 7, 7]"
}
```
