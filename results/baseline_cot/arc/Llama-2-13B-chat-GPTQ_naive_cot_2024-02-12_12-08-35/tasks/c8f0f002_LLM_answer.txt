You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: [[1, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8], [1, 1, 7, 7, 1, 8], [7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8]]
output: [[1, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8], [1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 8]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 7, 7, 1], [1, 8, 1, 7], [7, 1, 1, 7]]
output: [[5, 5, 5, 1], [1, 8, 1, 5], [5, 1, 1, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[1, 8, 1, 7, 1], [7, 8, 8, 1, 1], [7, 1, 8, 8, 7]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my analysis of the given input-output pairs and the test case:

**Example 1:**

Input: [[1, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8], [1, 1, 7, 7, 1, 8], [7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8]]
Output: [[1, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8], [1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 8]]

Pattern: The input grid has two objects of color 8, one horizontal and one vertical, and three noise pixels of color 1. The output grid has the same objects, but the horizontal object has been stretched horizontally and vertically, while the vertical object has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The noise pixels have been replaced with color 5.

**Example 2:**

Input: [[7, 7, 7, 1], [1, 8, 1, 7], [7, 1, 1, 7]]
Output: [[5, 5, 5, 1], [1, 8, 1, 5], [5, 1, 1, 5]]

Pattern: The input grid has three identical objects of color 7, arranged in a row. The output grid has the same objects, but they have been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise and shifted one pixel to the right.

**Example 3:**

Input: [[1, 8, 1, 7, 1], [7, 8, 8, 1, 1], [7, 1, 8, 8, 7]]
Output: [[1, 8, 1, 5, 1], [5, 8, 8, 1, 1], [5, 1, 8, 8, 5]]

Pattern: The input grid has two objects of color 8, one horizontal and one vertical, and two noise pixels of color 1. The output grid has the same objects, but the horizontal object has been shrunk horizontally and vertically, while the vertical object has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The noise pixels have been replaced with color 5.

**Test Case:**

Input: [[1, 7, 7, 1, 7], [8, 1, 7, 7, 7], [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]]

Based on the patterns observed in the example inputs, we can infer that the desired transformation is a combination of geometric and topological operations, such as scaling, rotation, reflection, and noise addition. Specifically, we can expect the following transformations:

* Horizontal and vertical stretching and shrinking
* Rotation by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise
* Reflection across the central vertical line
* Noise addition in various forms, including random placement and value assignment

To achieve these transformations, we can apply a series of operations to the input grid, such as:

1. Apply a horizontal and vertical scale factor to each pixel value, randomly chosen from a range of 0 to 1.
2. Rotate each object by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the orientation of the object.
3. Reflect each object across the central vertical line.
4. Add noise to each pixel value, using a probability distribution that assigns higher likelihood to pixels near object boundaries.

Here's the expected output grid for the test case:

Output: [[5, 8, 8, 1, 7], [1, 7, 7, 7, 8], [8, 7, 1, 7, 5]]

Note that this output is just one possible realization of the expected transformation, and there may be other valid outputs depending on the specific implementation details.
