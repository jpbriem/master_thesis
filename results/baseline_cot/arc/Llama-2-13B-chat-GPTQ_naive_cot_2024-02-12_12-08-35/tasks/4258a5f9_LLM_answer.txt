You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'd be happy to help you with this task. Here's my understanding of the problem:

You have been given a set of input-output pairs, where each pair consists of a 2D grid of pixels and the corresponding output grid that has undergone some transformation. Your task is to infer the relation between the input and output grids, and then transform a new input grid into its corresponding output grid using the same transformation rules.

The input grids are represented as lists of integers, where each integer corresponds to a pixel value (either 0 or 1). The output grids are also represented as lists of integers, but they may contain additional information such as object boundaries or symmetries.

The transformation rules seem to involve geometric and topological operations such as lines, rectangles, and reflections, as well as object-based operations such as copying, resizing, and moving objects. The exact rules are not explicitly stated, but you need to figure them out by analyzing the input-output pairs.

To solve this task, I would suggest starting by carefully examining each input-output pair and trying to identify any patterns or relationships between the inputs and outputs. You may want to create diagrams or sketches of the grids to help visualize the transformations.

Once you have identified the key features of the transformations, you can start working on the actual implementation. It might be helpful to write a function that takes an input grid and applies the appropriate transformation rules to produce the output grid. You can then test your function on the sample input-output pairs to ensure that it is working correctly.

Finally, when you are ready to submit your solution, you will need to provide a JSON object that describes the input and output grids, as well as any other relevant information such as the transformation rules.
