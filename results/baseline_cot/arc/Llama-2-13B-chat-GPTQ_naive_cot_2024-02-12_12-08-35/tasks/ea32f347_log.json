The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

The goal is to learn how to recognize and generate these transformations to create new grids that meet specific criteria.\n\nHere are some key concepts related to this task:\n\n1. Grid objects: These are the basic elements that make up the grid, such as pixels or cells. They may have properties like color, size, and position.\n2. Transformations: These are operations applied to the grid objects to change their properties or positions. Examples include rotation, scaling, flipping, and moving.\n3. Pattern recognition: This involves identifying specific patterns or structures within the grid, such as lines, shapes, or colors.\n4. Object-based transformations: These are transformations that affect specific objects within the grid, such as resizing, rotating, or moving them.\n5. Symmetry and reflection: These are techniques used to create symmetry or reflection in the grid, such as flipping or rotating objects around a central point.\n6. Color manipulation: This includes changing the color palette, adding noise, or modifying individual pixel colors.\n7. Geometric and topological analysis: This involves analyzing the geometric and topological structure of the grid, such as connected components, holes, or boundaries.\n8. Test cases: These are specific input grids used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, including expected outputs and desired transformations.\n\nTo solve this task, you will need to understand the relationships between these concepts and develop strategies for recognizing and generating transformations. You may also need to implement algorithms for performing these transformations and evaluating the results."
