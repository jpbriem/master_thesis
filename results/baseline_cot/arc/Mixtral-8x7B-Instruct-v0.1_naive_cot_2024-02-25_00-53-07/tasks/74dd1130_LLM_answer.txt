prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[2, 2, 1], [1, 5, 1], [5, 2, 2]]
output: [[2, 1, 5], [2, 5, 2], [1, 1, 2]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 2, 5], [6, 2, 2], [5, 5, 5]]
output: [[2, 6, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 2, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[9, 9, 5], [5, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]
output: [[9, 5, 5], [9, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]

Example_4:
input: [[2, 6, 6], [2, 1, 1], [2, 6, 2]]
output: [[2, 2, 2], [6, 1, 6], [6, 1, 2]]



Test case:
input: [[9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4]]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the JSON formatted response for the given problem:

```json
{
    "example_1_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input and output grids differ in their arrangement of colors. Each row in the input grid moves one position rightwards in the output grid, wrapping around to the beginning if necessary.",
        "object_changes": "There are no distinct objects in this example; however, each group of connected pixels (of any particular color) moves together according to the described rule."
    },
    "example_2_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "Similar to the previous example, each row in the input grid moves one position leftwards in the output grid, wrapping around to the end if necessary.",
        "object_changes": "Again, there are no distinct objects, but groups of connected pixels move as a whole."
    },
    "example_3_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example demonstrates that when a color appears more than once in a row, it breaks apart during the transformation process. In this case, the two instances of '5' in the second row break apart while moving.",
        "object_changes": "As before, groups of connected pixels move according to the described rules, breaking apart when multiple instances of a color appear in a row."
    },
    "example_4_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example shows that when a color appears twice in a column, it merges during the transformation process. In this case, the two instances of '2' in the first column merge while moving.",
        "object_changes": "Groups of connected pixels move according to the described rules, merging when multiple instances of a color appear in a column."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Each row in the input grid shifts either left or right by one position in the output grid, depending on whether the last element of the row is equal to the first element. If they are equal, the row wraps around to the opposite side. Additionally, when multiple instances of a color appear in a row or column, they may break apart or merge, respectively.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation:\n1. For each row in the input grid, check if the last element is equal to the first element.\n2. If true, shift the entire row one position towards the opposite direction (left if equal, right otherwise).\n3. When shifting rows, ensure that elements that leave the grid reappear on the other side.\n4. Handle cases where multiple instances of a color appear in a row or column, allowing them to break apart or merge accordingly.",
    "test_case_input_copy": "[[9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4]]",
    "test_case_grid_view": "The input grid contains three rows and three columns. Rows consist of repeated '9' followed by alternating '3' and '4'.",
    "test_case_object_view": "There are no distinct objects in this grid, just repetitive sequences of numbers.",
    "test_case_transformation": "Shift each row one position leftwards, handling cases where multiple instances of a color appear in a row or column.",
    "test_case_output": "[[4, 9, 3], [4, 9, 3], [4, 9, 3]]"
