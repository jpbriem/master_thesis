You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [7, 2, 8]]

Example_3:
input: [[4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [4, 2, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[4, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{
  "example_1_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "In the output grid, the colors from the non-zero pixels are filled down and to the right until they hit another non-zero pixel or the edge of the grid.",
    "object_changes": "regarding the first example, the size of the object with color '6' has increased from 1 to 3 pixels, and the object with color '4' has increased from 1 to 2 pixels. The object with color '3' remains unchanged in size but extends its color to the right."
  },
  "example_2_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "Similar to the first example, colors fill down and to the right. The color '2' fills the empty spaces in its row and below until it meets another color or the edge of the grid. The color '7' does the same.",
    "object_changes": "The object with color '2' expands from a single pixel to cover three pixels, and the object with color '7' also expands to cover three pixels. The objects with colors '7' and '8' are not changed."
  },
  "example_3_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "The color '4' fills down its column, and the color '2' fills to the right in its row.",
    "object_changes": "The object with color '4' expands from 1 to 3 pixels, and the object with color '2' expands from 1 to 2 pixels."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Colors from non-zero pixels fill down and to the right until they encounter another non-zero pixel or the edge of the grid.",
  "instructions": "Starting from the top-left of the grid, move through each pixel. If the pixel is non-zero, copy its value to all pixels directly below it and to its right until you reach another non-zero pixel or the edge of the grid.",
  "test_case_input_copy": [[4, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0]],
  "test_case_grid_view": "The grid contains three non-zero pixels with colors '4', '8', and '7' at coordinates (0,0), (0,2), and (2,1), respectively.",
  "test_case_object_view": "There are three objects based on color. Object_1 with color '4' and size 1 at coordinates [(0,0)], Object_2 with color '8' and size 1 at coordinates [(0,2)], and Object_3 with color '7' and size 1 at coordinates [(2,1)].",
  "test_case_transformation": "Color '4' should fill down its column. Color '8' should fill to the right in its row and then down. Color '7' should fill to the right in its row.",
  "test_case_output": [[4, 0, 8], [4, 0, 8], [4, 7, 8]]
