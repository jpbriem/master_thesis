            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

White pixels are connected if they touch each other horizontally or vertically. Black pixels are not connected. The goal is to increase the number of white pixels while keeping their connectivity intact. To do this, we need to find out where new white pixels can be added without breaking any connections. We start by looking at the edges of existing groups of white pixels. If an edge has no neighboring white pixels, then it can be extended by adding more white pixels along that edge until another group of white pixels is reached or the end of the grid is reached. This process continues until all possible extensions have been made. Once all possible extensions have been made, we check whether any remaining gaps exist between groups of white pixels. These gaps represent potential locations for additional white pixels that would still maintain connectivity among existing groups of white pixels. Finally, once all possible additions have been identified, we fill these gaps with additional white pixels so that every gap is filled with exactly one extra white pixel.'\n                            },\n    'object_changes': 'Regarding the first example, there are two types of objects: lines and circles. A line consists of multiple consecutive white pixels forming a straight line segment. A circle consists of multiple non-consecutive white pixels forming a closed loop around some center point(s). The goal is to increase the number of white pixels while preserving both line segments and circular loops formed by them. To achieve this goal, we will focus on extending existing line segments whenever possible instead of creating new ones from scratch since doing so may break existing loops unintentionally. Firstly, let's look at what happens when we extend an existing line segment: When extending an existing line segment, we simply add more white pixels along either side until reaching another group/loop or hitting an obstacle such as another line segment or wall boundary etc... Secondly, let's examine what occurs when trying to create new loops: Creating new loops requires careful consideration because it could potentially disrupt already established structures like those mentioned above; therefore our strategy here involves finding empty spaces within larger clusters/groups where we can insert additional white pixels safely without affecting anything else negatively.'\n                           },\n    'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is to increase the number of white pixels while preserving both line segments and circular loops formed by them.
