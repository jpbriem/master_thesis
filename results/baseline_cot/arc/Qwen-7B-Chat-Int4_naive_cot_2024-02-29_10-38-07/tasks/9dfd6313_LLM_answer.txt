prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[5, 0, 0], [3, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]
output: [[5, 3, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]

Example_2:
input: [[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0], [6, 0, 5, 0], [6, 0, 4, 5]]
output: [[5, 0, 6, 6], [0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 4], [0, 0, 0, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 5, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 5, 0], [0, 2, 0, 1, 5]]
output: [[5, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 5, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]



Test case:
input: [[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0], [2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]

Sample Outputs:
Here's an explanation of the transformation pattern for the given input-output pairs:

  * Example_1: The transformation involves moving each pixel along a fixed vector. For instance, the first pixel moves right by one position, the second pixel moves up by two positions, and the third pixel remains unchanged. As a result, the output grid has the same pattern as the input grid, but shifted horizontally and vertically.
  * Example_2: This transformation involves rotating each pixel around a fixed point. In this case, the center of rotation is the origin (i.e., [0, 0]). So, the first pixel rotates clockwise by 90 degrees, the second pixel remains unchanged, the third pixel rotates counterclockwise by 90 degrees, and so on. As a result, the output grid has the same pattern as the input grid, but rotated by 90 degrees about the origin.
  * Example_3: This transformation involves scaling each pixel uniformly by a factor of two. Specifically, each pixel's x-coordinate increases by half its original value, while its y-coordinate decreases by half its original value. As a result, the output grid has twice the width and height of the input grid, but the same pattern.

Now let's apply these transformation rules to the given test case:

  * Test Case: Here, we need to move each pixel along a fixed vector that varies depending on the location of the pixel. To do this, we can define a set of vectors that start at the origin (i.e., [0, 0]) and move in different directions. We then iterate over each pixel and calculate its new position using the appropriate vector. Finally, we update the pixel in the output grid accordingly.
  * Output Grid: After applying the transformation, the output grid will look like this:

```
[[5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
 [2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]
```


As you can see, the output grid has the same pattern as the input grid, but each pixel has been moved along a different vector according to its location. Note that the direction of the vector depends on the row and column index of the pixel. For instance, the first pixel in the first row is moved right by one position, the second pixel in the first row is moved up by two positions, and so on. Similarly, the first pixel in the second row is moved left by one position, the second pixel in the second row is moved down by two positions, and so on.
