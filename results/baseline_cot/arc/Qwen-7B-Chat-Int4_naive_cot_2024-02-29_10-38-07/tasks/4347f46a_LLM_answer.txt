prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Overall Pattern:

The overall pattern for this task is that we need to take an input grid and transform it into another grid that has certain properties. Specifically, we need to copy the input grid and then apply a series of operations to the copied grid such that the output grid matches the desired properties.

Instructions:

To solve this task, you will need to follow these steps:

  1. Read the input grid and store it in a variable called `grid`.
  2. Create a new empty matrix called `transformedGrid` that is the same size as the original grid.
  3. Iterate over each row and column of the `grid`, starting from the top left corner and moving towards the bottom right corner.
  4. For each element in the current row and column, check if it is a number (i.e., not an object). If it is a number, perform the operation described in the corresponding cell in the example given in the problem statement. Otherwise, leave the element unchanged.
  5. After iterating through all rows and columns, return the `transformedGrid`.

Note that the specific operations performed in step 4 depend on the corresponding cell in the example provided. You will need to carefully read and understand the example to determine what operations to perform.

Here's some sample Python code that implements the above instructions:

```python
def transformGrid(grid):
    # Step 1: Read the input grid and store it in a variable
    transformedGrid = []

    # Step 2: Create a new empty matrix called transformedGrid
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        transformedGrid.append([0] * len(grid[i]))

    # Step 3: Iterate over each row and column of the grid
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            # Step 4: Check if the element is a number
            if isinstance(grid[i][j], int):
                # Perform the appropriate operation according to the example
                if grid[i][j] == 0:
                    transformedGrid[i][j] = grid[i][j]
                elif grid[i][j] == 1:
                    transformedGrid[i][j] = grid[i][j] + 1
                elif grid[i][j] == 2:
                    transformedGrid[i][j] = grid[i][j] - 1
                else:
                    print("Invalid input")
            else:
                # Leave the element unchanged
                transformedGrid[i][j] = grid[i][j]

    # Step 5: Return the transformedGrid
    return transformedGrid
```

This function takes an input grid as a parameter and returns a transformed grid with the specified properties. You can call this function with any input grid to get the transformed grid.
