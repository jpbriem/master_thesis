prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
To transform the given input into the desired output, we need to apply a series of operations that correspond to the transformation pattern described in the examples. Here's an outline of the steps involved:

  1. Identify the overall structure of the input and output grids. In this case, both grids have a 5x5 structure with a 2x2 block in the center.
  2. Determine the symmetry of the transformation. In this case, the transformation appears to involve rotating and scaling the grid around the central block. This means that the input and output grids will be mirror images of each other when viewed from certain angles.
  3. Implement the rotation and scaling operations using mathematical techniques such as matrix multiplication. For example, to rotate a 2D grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise, we can create a new matrix that reflects the grid across the y-axis. To scale a grid by a factor of 2, we can multiply every element of the grid by 2.
  4. Apply these operations to the input grid to obtain the output grid. We can then verify that the output grid matches the desired output pattern.

Here's some Python code that implements the above steps:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the input grid
input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 8, 8, 8, 0],
                       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 8, 8, 8, 8]])

# Define the desired output grid
desired_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 8, 2, 8, 0],
                           [0, 2, 8, 8, 0],
                           [0, 2, 2, 8, 0]])

# Create a copy of the input grid
input_copy = input_grid.copy()

# Rotate the input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise
rotation_matrix = np.array([[0, -1],
                            [1, 0]])
rotated_grid = np.dot(input_copy, rotation_matrix)

# Scale the rotated grid by a factor of 2
scaled_grid = np.multiply(rotated_grid, 2)

# Verify that the scaled grid matches the desired output
np.allclose(scaled_grid, desired_output)
```

This code should produce `True` if the scaled grid matches the desired output, indicating that the transformation has been successfully applied. Note that the specific implementation may vary depending on the details of the transformation pattern and the desired output.
