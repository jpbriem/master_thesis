            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output.

You are provided with two example inputs and outputs, and are asked to determine the pattern and transformation rules for these examples. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples: We can see that the input and output grids have similar structures but with different pixel values. For example, in Example 1, there are two groups of five identical pixels arranged symmetrically around a central pixel of value 0. In Example 2, there is a single group of five identical pixels arranged in a line. \n\n2. Determine the pattern: Based on the analysis above, it seems like the pattern involves arranging groups of identical pixels in specific configurations. For example, in Example 1, the pattern involves arranging four groups of five identical pixels in a square configuration, with each group separated by a single pixel of value 0. In Example 2, the pattern involves arranging a single group of five identical pixels in a straight line.\n\n3. Determine the transformation: To transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to apply a rule that relates to the pattern. One possible rule could be to rearrange the pixels according to their position relative to the center of the grid. For example, in Example 1, we can arrange the pixels so that they form a square configuration centered at the origin, with each group of five pixels arranged symmetrically around the origin. This would result in the output grid shown in the question. Similarly, in Example 2, we can arrange the pixels so that they form a straight line along the x-axis, starting at the origin and ending at a certain distance away. This would result in the output grid shown in the question.\n\n4. Write the implementation: Once we have determined the pattern and transformation, we can write a Python function that implements the transformation rule. Here's an example implementation using NumPy arrays:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input):\n    # Step 2: Determine the pattern\n    num_groups = int(np.sqrt(len(input)))\n    if num_groups**2 != len(input):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be a perfect square\")\n    groups = []\n    for i in range(num_groups):\n        group = input[i*num_groups:(i+1)*num_groups]\n        groups.append(group)\n    \n    # Step 3: Apply the transformation\n    output = np.zeros_like(input)\n    for group in groups:\n        # Arrange the group in a square configuration centered at the origin\n        y = (group.shape[0]-1)/2\n        x = (group.shape[1]-1)/2\n        output[y:y+group.shape[0], x:x+group.shape[1]] = group\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first determine the number of groups needed to fit the input grid into a square configuration. We then loop over each group and arrange it in a square configuration centered at the origin. Finally, we create an empty output grid and copy the arrangement of the input groups into the output grid."
