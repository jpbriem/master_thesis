            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9,

grid-like structure. The goal is to move certain elements to specific positions while maintaining a consistent arrangement of other elements. Here's a possible solution:\n\n  * Identify the starting position of each element (i.e., where it starts).\n  * Define a function that takes two arguments: the current position of an element and the desired destination position. This function should return true if the element can be moved to the destination without violating any constraints, false otherwise.\n  * Iterate through the elements in the order they appear in the input grid. For each element, check if it can be moved to its desired destination using the above function. If yes, perform the move; otherwise, do nothing.\n  * After iterating through all elements, check if there are any remaining empty spaces in the grid. If so, select one of them as the final destination for any remaining elements that cannot be placed elsewhere.\n  * Output the final grid configuration.\n\nHere's some Python code that implements this approach:\n```python\ndef move_element(grid, src, dst):\n    # Check if the source and destination are within the grid\n    if src < 0 or src >= len(grid) or dst < 0 or dst >= len(grid[0]):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the destination is occupied\n    if grid[src][dst] != 0:\n        return False\n\n    # Move the element and update the grid\n    grid[src][dst] = grid[dst][src]\n    grid[src][src] = 0\n\n    return True\n\n\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    grid = input_grid.copy()\n\n    # Iterate through the elements in the grid\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n            # Check if the current cell is empty\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Select a random destination cell\n                dst = np.random.randint(0, len(grid), 1)[0]\n\n                # Try to move the element to the destination\n                if move_element(grid, i, dst):\n                    print(f\"Moved element {grid[i][j]} to {grid[dst][src]}\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"Element cannot be moved.\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Element already occupied: {grid[i][j]}\")\n\n    # Check if there are any remaining empty cells\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                print(f\"No more empty cells left.\")\n                break\n```\n\nNote that this is just one possible implementation, and there may be many other ways to solve this problem depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the puzzle."
