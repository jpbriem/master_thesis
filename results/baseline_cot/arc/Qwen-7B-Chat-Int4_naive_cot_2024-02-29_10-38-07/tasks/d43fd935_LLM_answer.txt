prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Sample Outputs:
Input-output Transformation Pattern:
In this problem, the input grid consists of a series of cells that represent the state of an environment. Each cell has a value that ranges from 1 to 9, where 1 represents a clear space and 9 represents a solid wall. The goal of the transformation is to rearrange these cells so that they form a new grid that represents the same environment but with some modifications.
For each input grid, there is a corresponding output grid that is obtained through a sequence of operations. These operations involve moving, copying, and transforming individual cells or groups of cells in the input grid to create the desired configuration in the output grid. The specific sequence of operations depends on the particular input grid and the desired output.
Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern for solving this problem involves analyzing the input grid and identifying the possible operations that can be performed to transform it into the desired output. Once the set of possible operations has been identified, the algorithm must determine the optimal sequence of operations that minimizes the number of steps required to reach the final output.
Instructions:
To solve this problem, you will need to follow these general instructions:

  1. Analyze the input grid to identify the possible operations that can be performed to transform it into the desired output.
  2. Determine the optimal sequence of operations that minimizes the number of steps required to reach the final output.
  3. Apply the chosen sequence of operations to the input grid to obtain the desired output.
  4. Verify that the output grid matches the expected output based on the provided test cases.

Test Case Input Copy:
Copy the test case input grid from the task and paste it below:

```css
[[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Test Case Grid View:
Here's a description of the pixels of the entire input grid:

|Position| Pixel|
|---|---|
|(0,0)| 0|
|(0,1)| 0|
|(0,2)| 0|
|...| ...|
|(2,0)| 2|
|(2,1)| 0|
|(2,2)| 0|
|...| ...|
|(6,0)| 6|
|(6,1)| 0|
|(6,2)| 0|
|...| ...|
|(8,0)| 0|
|(8,1)| 0|
|(8,2)| 0|
|...| ...|

Test Case Object View:
Here's a description of the objects of the entire input grid:

|Position| Color| Size| Coordinates| Shape| Movement|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|(0,0)| | | | | |
|(0,1)| | | | | |
|(0,2)| | | | | |

Test Case Transformed Output:
Based on the given input grid, here's the transformed output grid:

```css
[[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Note that the `Color`, `Size`, `Coordinates`, and `Movement` columns are empty because there are no objects present in the input grid.
Test Case Overall Pattern:
In this problem, the overall pattern involves analyzing the input grid and determining the possible operations that can be performed to transform it into the desired output. Once the set of possible operations has been identified, the algorithm must determine the optimal sequence of operations that minimizes the number of steps required to reach the final output. This process involves breaking down the input grid into smaller components, such as cells or objects, and applying various transformations to them in order to achieve the desired result.
Instructions (continued):
Once you have determined the optimal sequence of operations, apply them to the input grid to obtain the desired output. In this case, the output grid is obtained by swapping the position of two adjacent cells in the input grid. Specifically, we swap the positions of the second and third rows of the input grid, effectively reversing their order. Here's how the output grid looks like after applying the operation:

```css
[[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

As you can see, the output grid now contains the same information as the original input grid, but with the positions of the two rows reversed. Note that this operation does not affect any of the other properties of the input grid, such as the values of the cells or the presence of objects. Therefore, this transformation is considered valid according to the provided test case input.
