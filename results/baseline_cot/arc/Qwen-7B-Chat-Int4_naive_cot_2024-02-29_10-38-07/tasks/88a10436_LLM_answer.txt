prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
The provided input-output pairs seem to follow a common pattern where each object is represented by a set of connected pixels that form a specific shape. In Example_1, there are three objects: two squares and one rectangle. Each object has a unique combination of colors and sizes. In Example_2, there is only one object, a hexagon. It has a unique combination of colors and sizes. In Example_3, there are five objects: four squares and one triangle. They also have unique combinations of colors and sizes.
To transform the test case input grid into its test case output grid, we need to identify the objects in the input grid and then apply the appropriate transformation rules to each object.
For example, in Example_1, the first square is composed of the pixels [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3]]. Its transformation rule would be to move it horizontally to position [1, 1].
In Example_2, the hexagon is composed of the pixels [[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]. Its transformation rule would be to rotate it counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
In Example_3, the fourth square is composed of the pixels [[0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]. Its transformation rule would be to move it vertically to position [3, 3].
After applying these transformation rules to each object, we get the following output grid:

|example| description|
|---|---|
|example_1| the first square moves from position [0, 0] to position [1, 1]. the second square remains at position [2, 2]. the third square remains at position [0, 0]. the fourth square moves from position [0, 3] to position [3, 3]. the fifth square remains at position [0, 0]. the sixth square remains at position [0, 0]. the seventh square remains at position [0, 0]. the eighth square remains at position [0, 0]. the ninth square remains at position [0, 0]. the tenth square remains at position [0, 0].|
|example_2| the hexagon rotates counterclockwise by 90 degrees.|
|example_3| the fourth square moves from position [0, 3] to position [3, 3].|

Note that this is just an example of one possible solution. There may be other ways to transform the input grid into the output grid depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
