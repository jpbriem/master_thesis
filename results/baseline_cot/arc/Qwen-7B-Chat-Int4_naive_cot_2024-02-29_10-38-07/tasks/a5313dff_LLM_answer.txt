prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Sample Outputs:
Here's an explanation of the underlying pattern:

The given input-output pairs share a common pattern where each pixel or object in the input grid undergoes certain transformations to produce the corresponding output grid. 

In general, the transformation involves copying, rotating, scaling, and reflecting the objects or pixels in the input grid to create the output grid. In some cases, there may also be additional operations such as mirroring, merging, splitting, etc.

To transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to identify the objects or pixels in the input grid and apply the appropriate transformations to them. For instance, if two objects touch each other in the input grid, they will remain connected in the output grid after the transformation.

Overall, the transformation pattern appears to involve a combination of geometric and topological operations that preserve the connectivity and structure of the objects or pixels in the input grid.

Now let's move on to describing the test case in more detail.

Input Grid (Test Case):
The input grid consists of 8x8 pixels arranged in a square matrix. There are 6 black pixels (0) and 2 white pixels (2). One of the white pixels (at position [2,2]) touches another white pixel (at position [6,6]). We can see that these two white pixels form a continuous path through the input grid.

Output Grid (Expected Result):
Based on the above description, we can expect the output grid to consist of 8x8 pixels arranged in a square matrix. All 6 black pixels and both white pixels will be present in the output grid. However, the positions of the white pixels may differ from their original positions due to the transformation process.

Transformation Pattern:
As mentioned earlier, the transformation pattern involves a combination of geometric and topological operations that preserve the connectivity and structure of the objects or pixels in the input grid. To achieve this, we need to identify the objects or pixels in the input grid and apply the appropriate transformations to them.

For the given test case, we can see that the two white pixels touch each other in the input grid. Therefore, we need to copy and reflect these two white pixels across the center of the input grid to create the output grid. This will result in two new white pixels appearing in the output grid at positions [2,7] and [7,2].

Additionally, since the two white pixels touch each other in the input grid, they will remain connected in the output grid. Therefore, we do not need to split or merge any objects in the input grid during the transformation process.

Overall, the transformation pattern appears to involve a combination of copying, reflection, and translation operations that preserve the connectivity and structure of the objects or pixels in the input grid.
