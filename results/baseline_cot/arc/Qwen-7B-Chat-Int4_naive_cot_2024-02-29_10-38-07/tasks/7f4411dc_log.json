            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nIn this task, you are given three examples of input-output pairs where the input consists of a matrix of integers. The output is another matrix of integers that describes a transformation of the input matrix. \n\nTo solve this task, you need to understand the rules governing the transformation. One possible approach is to look at each element of the input matrix and determine what operation(s) it undergoes in the output matrix. You can then create a function that takes an input matrix as input and returns an output matrix according to these rules.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, we see that each element is multiplied by 7 and shifted left by 1 position. In Example 2, we see that each element is divided by 2 and then negated. In Example 3, we see that some elements are replaced with others.\n\nOnce you have identified the rules governing the transformation, you can write code that implements these rules. For instance, if the rule is to multiply each element by 7 and shift left by 1 position, you can write a Python function like this:\n\n```python\ndef transform(matrix):\n    # Multiply each element by 7 and shift left by 1 position\n    return [[matrix[i][j]*7 for j in range(len(matrix[0]))] + [matrix[i][j] for j in range(len(matrix[0])-1)] for i in range(len(matrix))]\n```\n\nThis function takes an input matrix `matrix` and returns an output matrix that satisfies the transformation rule.\n\nNote that there may be multiple ways to implement the same transformation rule, so you may want to try out several approaches and compare their results."
