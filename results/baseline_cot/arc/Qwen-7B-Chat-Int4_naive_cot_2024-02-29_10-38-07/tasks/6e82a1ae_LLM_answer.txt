prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
This appears to be a set of instructions for transforming an input grid into an output grid using specific rules. The input and output grids appear to be composed of zeros and ones, with certain regions of the grid designated as "objects" that must remain unchanged. The overall pattern seems to involve connecting neighboring objects together and manipulating the position of some of the objects relative to their neighbors. It's unclear what the specific objective of this transformation is without more context. To create the output grid, you would need to follow these steps:

  1. Identify any objects in the input grid that need to be preserved in the output grid.
  2. Determine the connections between those objects and modify the positions of the other objects accordingly.
  3. Repeat until no further modifications are necessary.

To write a function that implements this algorithm, you could start by defining a data structure to represent each object in the grid. This might include information such as the object's position (x, y), size, and color. You could then define a method to identify and preserve the objects in the input grid, and another method to connect the remaining objects together according to the desired pattern. Finally, you could implement a loop to iterate over the input grid and apply these methods until no further modifications are needed. Here is an example implementation in Python:
```python
class Object:
    def __init__(self, x, y, size, color):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.size = size
        self.color = color

def find_objects(input_grid):
    # TODO: Implement logic to find and return a list of objects in the input grid

def preserve_objects(output_grid, objects):
    # TODO: Implement logic to preserve the specified objects in the output grid

def connect_objects(output_grid):
    # TODO: Implement logic to connect the remaining objects together according to the desired pattern

def transform(input_grid):
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    objects = find_objects(input_grid)
    preserved_objects = preserve_objects(output_grid, objects)
    connected_objects = connect_objects(output_grid)
    return connected_objects
```

In this implementation, `find_objects` would need to search through the input grid to identify any objects that need to be preserved in the output grid. `preserve_objects` would then modify the positions of the preserved objects in the output grid so that they maintain their original positions. Finally, `connect_objects` would connect the remaining objects together according to the desired pattern. The `transform` function would simply call these three methods in sequence and return the result. Note that this is just one possible implementation, and there may be many ways to solve this problem depending on the specifics of the requirements.
