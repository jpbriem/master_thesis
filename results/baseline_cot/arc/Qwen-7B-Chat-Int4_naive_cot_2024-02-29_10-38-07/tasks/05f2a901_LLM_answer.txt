prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The given examples exhibit certain commonalities in terms of their underlying transformation patterns:

  * Each example involves transforming an input grid into an output grid that has identical dimensions but with some elements replaced or added/removed.
  * In each example, there exists a set of objects (represented by unique colors) that remain constant throughout the transformation process.
  * The transformation pattern appears to involve shifting, rotating, and/or scaling the input grid while preserving the relative positions of the objects.
  * The overall transformation pattern seems to follow a consistent logic where specific regions of the input grid undergo different operations than others.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the input-output relationships shared among the examples may be described as follows:

  * For each example, there exists a set of rules that govern how the input grid is transformed into the output grid.
  * These rules involve applying various geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation, scaling) to specific regions of the input grid, depending on the desired outcome.
  * The rules also take into account the positions and colors of the objects within the input grid, ensuring that they are preserved during the transformation process.

In summary, the input-output relationships shared among the provided examples can be described as follows:

  * Input: A two-dimensional grid of pixels, where each pixel has an integer value indicating its color.
  * Output: Another two-dimensional grid of pixels, where the values indicate the new color assigned to each pixel after undergoing a transformation.

Overall Pattern: The overall pattern followed by this type of transformation is a generalization of more specific rules governing individual examples. It involves applying a sequence of geometric transformations to a portion of the input grid, taking into account the locations and colors of the objects within it. This results in a final output grid that reflects the desired changes in color, size, position, etc., without affecting the integrity of the original objects.
