            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe input-output pairs provided share the same underlying transformation pattern where certain elements in the input grid are replaced by their value plus two in the output grid. This transformation appears to be applied to each row of the input grid, starting from the top left corner. \n\nFor example, in Example_1, the first element in each row is incremented by two, while in Example_2, the second element in each row is incremented by two. In Example_3, the third element in each row is incremented by two.\n\nTo apply this transformation to the given test case, we would start from the top-left corner of the input grid (which has the value 0) and increment it by two to get the corresponding value in the output grid (which will also be 0). We would then move to the next element in the input grid and repeat the process until we reach the end of the last row. Finally, we would move back to the top-left corner of the input grid and repeat the process again until we reach the end of the last column.\n\nBased on this understanding of the underlying pattern, we can create the following JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"example_1_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"Each element in the input grid is incremented by two to get its corresponding element in the output grid\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"No objects are present in this example\"\n    },\n    \"example_2_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"The second element in each row is incremented by two to get its corresponding element in the output grid\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"No objects are present in this example\"\n    },\n    \"example_3_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"The third element in each row is incremented by two to get its corresponding element in the output grid\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"No objects are present in this example\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Incrementing every other element in each row by two\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Start from the top-left corner of the input grid and increment the current element by two. Move to the next element in the row and repeat the process until you reach the end of the row. Move back to the top-left corner of the input grid and repeat the process again until you reach the end of the column.\",\n    \"test_case_input_copy\": \"[[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\",\n    \"test_case_grid_view\": \"[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\",\n    \"test_case_object_view\": \"No objects are present in this example\",\n    \"test_case_transformation\": \"Replace every other element in each row with its value plus two\",\n    \"test_case_output\": \"[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that there are no objects present in the input grid, so the `test_case_object_view` field is empty. Also, the `test_case_output` field contains the transformed output grid as a numpy array."
