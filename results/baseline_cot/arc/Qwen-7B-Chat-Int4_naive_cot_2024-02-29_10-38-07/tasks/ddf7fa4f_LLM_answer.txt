prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the transformation pattern that exists between the given input and output grids. We will then create an algorithm that can perform this transformation on any new input grid.
The input-output pairs follow a consistent pattern where the output grid is obtained by shifting each element of the input grid by a certain amount along the x-axis and y-axis. This shift depends on the position of the element in the input grid. For example, if an element has coordinates (x,y) in the input grid, it will be shifted to coordinates (x+dx, y+dy) in the output grid, where dx and dy are constants determined by the transformation pattern.
In general, the transformation pattern consists of two main steps:

  1. Shift elements horizontally and vertically according to their positions in the input grid.
  2. Rotate the grid around its center point.

Let's break down these steps further:

  1. Horizontal and vertical shifts:

    * Start by defining two arrays dx and dy, where dx[i] and dy[i] represent the horizontal shift for element i in the input grid.
    * Iterate over every element in the input grid.
    * For each element, calculate its new coordinates using the formula (x + dx[i], y + dy[i]) and store them in the output grid.

  2. Rotation:

    * Define another array theta, where theta[i] represents the rotation angle for element i in the input grid.
    * Iterate over every element in the input grid.
    * For each element, calculate its new coordinates using the formula (cos(theta[i]), sin(theta[i])) * (x - dx[i]) + (sin(theta[i]), cos(theta[i])) * (y - dy[i]) + (0, 0), where (x - dx[i], y - dy[i]) represents the current coordinates of the element before rotation.
    * Store the rotated coordinates in the output grid.

By applying these steps iteratively, we can obtain the desired output grid for any given input grid.
Now let's apply this algorithm to the provided test case:

  * Initialize three arrays dx, dy, and theta, where dx = [-1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], dy = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, -1, -1, 0], and theta = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
  * Iterate over every element in the input grid.
  * Calculate the new coordinates using the formulas (x + dx[i], y + dy[i]) and store them in the output grid.
  * Calculate the rotated coordinates using the formula (cos(theta[i]), sin(theta[i])) * (x - dx[i]) + (sin(theta[i]), cos(theta[i])) * (y - dy[i]) + (0, 0).
  * Store the rotated coordinates in the output grid.

After performing these operations, we get the following output grid:

[[3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Therefore, the solution to the given test case is:

```
[[3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
