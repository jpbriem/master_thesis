prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

<</SYS>>
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [2, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 2], [1, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
output: [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2]]
output: [[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2]]

Example_4:
input: [[2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0]]
output: [[2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[2, 2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first example has a 3x3 input grid with values 0, 2, and 3. The output grid is also 3x3, with values 0, 2, and 1. The top-left corner (0,0) changed from 0 to 1, while the bottom-right corner (2,2) changed from 2 to 1.",
"object_changes": "There is one object in the input grid, colored 2, with a size of 3x3. It remains unchanged in the output grid."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The second example has a 4x4 input grid with values 0, 2, and 3. The output grid is also 4x4, with values 0, 2, and 1. The top-left corner (0,0) changed from 0 to 1, while the bottom-right corner (2,2) changed from 2 to 1. Additionally, there is a new object in the output grid, colored 1, with a size of 2x2, located at (1,1).",
"object_changes": "There are two objects in the input grid - one colored 2, with a size of 3x3, and another colored 3, with a size of 2x2. In the output grid, the object colored 2 remains unchanged, while the object colored 3 has shrunk by a factor of 2 in both dimensions and moved to the right by 2 pixels."
},
"overall_pattern": "Both examples follow a similar pattern of changing specific pixels and objects while keeping others intact. Pixels with value 2 change to value 1, while pixels with value 0 remain unchanged. Objects keep their color but may change in size or position.",
"instructions": "The required transformation actions are as follows:

1. Set all pixels with value 2 to value 1.
2. If an object is entirely contained within the top-left quarter of the grid, create a new object of the same color and size, shifted by (1,1) to the right and down.
3. Remove any objects that are entirely contained within the bottom-right quarter of the grid.
4. For every object, if it intersects with the diagonal line connecting the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid, mirror it across that line while preserving its color and size.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[[2, 2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2]]",

"test_case_object_view": "The four objects in the test input grid are:

1. A 3x3 object colored 2, located at (1,1).
2. A 2x2 object colored 2, located at (2,2).
3. A 2x2 object colored 0, located at (3,3).
