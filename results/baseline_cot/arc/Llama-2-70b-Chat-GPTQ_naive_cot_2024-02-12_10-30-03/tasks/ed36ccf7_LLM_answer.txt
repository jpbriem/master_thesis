[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

<</SYS>>
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]
output: [[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0]]
output: [[6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9], [9, 9, 9]]
output: [[9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9]]

Example_4:
input: [[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2]]
output: [[2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first example has a horizontal line of three 9s in the input grid, which becomes a vertical line of three 9s in the output grid, with the top and bottom rows remaining unchanged.",
"object_changes": "There is one object in the input grid, colored 9, with a size of 3x1 pixels. In the output grid, it is transformed into a 1x3 pixel object, still colored 9."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The second example has a 2x2 block of 6s in the center of the input grid, surrounded by zeros. In the output grid, the 6s are shifted one position to the right and up, so that they form a 2x2 block in the top-right corner, with the rest of the grid remaining unchanged.",
"object_changes": "There are two objects in the input grid - a 2x2 block of 6s in the center, and a single 6 in the top-left corner. In the output grid, the 2x2 block of 6s is shifted one position to the right and up, becoming a 2x2 block in the top-right corner, while the single 6 in the top-left corner remains unchanged."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve geometric transformations such as reflections, rotations, and translations, as well as changes in object sizes and positions. The transformations seem to be local, affecting only certain parts of the grid, rather than global changes affecting the entire grid.",
"instructions": "To solve this task, one could try to identify the specific transformation(s) applied to each example, and then generalize them to create a set of rules that can be applied to any input grid. One could also try to identify common features among the examples, such as symmetries or patterns, and use those to guide the creation of the transformation rules.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[[0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5]]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The test input grid consists of three rows and five columns, with values 0, 5, and 9. There are three objects in the grid - two horizontal lines of three 5s each, and a single 9 in the middle row.",
"test_case_object_view": "The three objects in the grid are - a 3x1 pixel object colored 5 in the top row, a 1x3 pixel object colored 5 in the middle row, and a 1x1 pixel object colored 9 in the bottom row.",
"test_case_transformation": "The transformation should preserve the overall structure of the grid, while changing the positions and sizes of certain objects. It should also introduce new objects or remove existing ones, if necessary, to create the desired output grid.",
"test_case_output": "[[0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 9]]"
