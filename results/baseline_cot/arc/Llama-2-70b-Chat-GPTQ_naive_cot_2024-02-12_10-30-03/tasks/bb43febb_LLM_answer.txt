[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

First, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, with 0 representing the background color.
* The task involves transforming the input grid into a corresponding output grid using a specific pattern or rule.
* The pattern involves relating individual pixels or objects in the grid to each other, possibly involving symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, scaling, and elastic distortions.
* The output grid will have the same dimensions as the input grid.

Now, let's analyze the two example inputs and outputs provided:

Example 1:
Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0], [5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0], [5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example 2:
Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]]

Based on these examples, it seems like the task involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, such that the output grid has the same dimensions but with modified pixel values. The transformations may include:

1. Mirroring: Reflecting the grid vertically or horizontally.
2. Rotation: Rotating the grid by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
3. Scaling: Resizing the grid by a factor of 2 or 3 in both dimensions.
4. Elastic distortion: Stretching or shrinking certain parts of the grid non-uniformly.
5. Translation: Moving the grid by a certain number of pixels in the x or y direction.
6. Symmetry: Creating a symmetric pattern by reflecting the grid around a vertical or horizontal axis.

To solve this task, we need to identify the sequence of transformations that would convert the input grid into the output grid for each example. Once we have the transformation sequence, we can apply it to the test input grid to obtain the test output grid.

Here's a possible approach to solving this task:

1. Analyze the input and output grids carefully, looking for patterns and relationships between pixels. Try to identify the minimum set of transformations necessary to convert the input grid into the output grid.
2. For each example, create a sequence of transformations that can be applied to the input grid to produce the output grid. Use a notation system to represent the transformations, such as 'M' for mirroring, 'R' for rotation, 'S' for scaling, 'E' for elastic distortion, 'T' for translation, and 'S' for symmetry.
3. Test your transformation sequences on the test input grid and verify that they produce the correct output grid. If there are multiple possible transformation sequences, choose the shortest or most elegant one.
4. Once you have successfully solved the task, you can describe the general pattern or rule that governs the transformations between the input and output grids. This description should be in JSON format, using the syntax described in the problem statement.

I hope this helps you get started on solving the task! Good luck!
