The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.\n\nFirst, let's summarize what we know so far:\n\n* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.\n* There are objects in the grid that are defined by their color and coordinates.\n* The task is to transform the input grid into a new grid using a set of rules that we need to figure out.\n\nBased on the input-output pairs provided, here are some observations:\n\n* The grid size remains the same after applying the transformation.\n* Some objects change color, while others remain unchanged.\n* New objects may appear or disappear after applying the transformation.\n* The transformation seems to be symmetrical, meaning that if a change occurs on one side of the grid, a similar change occurs on the other side.\n\nNow, let's try to formalize the rules for this transformation. Here's what I suggest:\n\n Rule 1: Mirroring\nIf a pixel has a color that appears only once in the grid, change its color to the next unique color in the cycle (wrapping around when necessary).\n\nFor example, in the first input-output pair, the top-left corner changes from 0 to 8 because 0 is the only instance of that color in the grid, and 8 is the next unique color. Similarly, the bottom-right corner changes from 0 to 0 because there are already two instances of 0 in the grid, and we wrap around to the beginning of the cycle.\n\nRule 2: Rotation\nRotate the grid by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nThis rule is straightforward and applies to every pixel in the grid.\n\nRule 3: Reflection\nReflect the grid vertically (i.e., flip it upside down).\n\nAgain, this rule applies to every pixel in the grid.\n\nRule 4: Color replacement\nReplace isolated pixels of a given color with a new color.\n\nIn the second input-output pair, the isolated 8 in the middle row gets replaced with 0. In the third input-output pair, the isolated 0 in the middle column gets replaced with 8.\n\nRule 5: Propagation\nPropagate a color change to neighboring pixels of the same color.\n\nIn the first input-output pair, the 8 in the top-left corner propagates to the right and bottom neighbors. In the second input-output pair, the 8 in the middle row propagates to the left and right neighbors.\n\nThese five rules seem to capture all the observed changes in the input-output pairs. Now, let's apply them to the test case input grid:\n\nInput grid:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAfter applying the five rules, the resulting output grid would be:\n\nOutput grid:\n\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n[0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI hope this helps you solve the task!
