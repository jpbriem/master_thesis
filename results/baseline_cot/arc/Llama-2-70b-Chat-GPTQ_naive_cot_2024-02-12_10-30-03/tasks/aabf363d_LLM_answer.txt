[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Example 1:

The input grid has a size of 7x7, with a 3x3 block of value 2 in the center, surrounded by a border of value 0. The output grid has a size of 7x7, with a 3x3 block of value 4 in the center, surrounded by a border of value 0.

The transformation can be described as follows:

* The 3x3 block of value 2 in the center of the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 block of value 4 in the center of the output grid.
* The border of value 0 around the 3x3 block in the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid.

Example 2:

The input grid has a size of 7x7, with a 3x3 block of value 3 in the top-left corner, surrounded by a border of value 0. The output grid has a size of 7x7, with a 3x3 block of value 6 in the bottom-right corner, surrounded by a border of value 0.

The transformation can be described as follows:

* The 3x3 block of value 3 in the top-left corner of the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 block of value 6 in the bottom-right corner of the output grid.
* The border of value 0 around the 3x3 block in the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid.

Test Case:

The input grid has a size of 8x8, with a 4x4 block of value 8 in the center, surrounded by a border of value 0. The output grid has a size of 8x8, with a 4x4 block of value 2 in the center, surrounded by a border of value 0.

The transformation can be described as follows:

* The 4x4 block of value 8 in the center of the input grid is replaced by a 4x4 block of value 2 in the center of the output grid.
* The border of value 0 around the 4x4 block in the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid.

Overall Pattern:

The input-output pairs demonstrate a pattern of replacing a block of a certain value in the center of the grid with a block of a different value, while keeping the surrounding border unchanged. The size of the block and the values involved in the replacement vary across input-output pairs.

Instructions:

To apply the transformation to a given input grid, follow these steps:

1. Identify the block of value 2 (or 3, 6, etc.) in the center of the grid.
2. Replace the identified block with a block of a new value (4, 8, 2, etc.), ensuring that the size of the new block matches the size of the original block.
3. Leave the surrounding border of value 0 unchanged.

Required Transformation Actions:

1. Find the center coordinates of the input grid.
2. Determine the size of the block to be replaced based on the input-output pair.
3. Replace the blocks of value 2 (or 3, 6, etc.) in the center of the grid with blocks of the new value (4, 8, 2, etc.).
4. Ensure that the surrounding border of value 0 remains unchanged.

Test Input Grid:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Test Output Grid:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
