You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

<</SYS>>
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[2, 2, 1], [1, 5, 1], [5, 2, 2]]
output: [[2, 1, 5], [2, 5, 2], [1, 1, 2]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 2, 5], [6, 2, 2], [5, 5, 5]]
output: [[2, 6, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 2, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[9, 9, 5], [5, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]
output: [[9, 5, 5], [9, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]

Example_4:
input: [[2, 6, 6], [2, 1, 1], [2, 6, 2]]
output: [[2, 2, 2], [6, 1, 6], [6, 1, 2]]



Test case:
input: [[9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first example has a horizontal line of three pixels (2, 2, 1) that remains unchanged in the output. Below it, there's a vertical line of three pixels (1, 5, 1) that gets mirrored around the center pixel (2, 2) in the output. At the bottom, there's a line of three pixels (5, 2, 2) that shifts two positions upwards while maintaining their order.",
"object_changes": "There are three objects in the input - two horizontal lines (colors 2 & 5) and a small vertical line (color 1). In the output, the leftmost object (color 2) stays put, while the middle object (color 1) moves up and right, becoming a small rectangle. The rightmost object (color 5) moves up and left, changing its orientation."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The second example features a central square of four pixels (2, 2, 5, 2) that remains intact in the output. Above it, there's a line of three pixels (6, 2, 2) that gets mirrored around the center pixel (2, 2) in the output. At the bottom, there's a line of three pixels (5, 5, 5) that shuffles its pixels and moves slightly upwards in the output.",
"object_changes": "There are four objects in the input - two horizontal lines (colors 2 & 6), a small vertical line (color 5), and a small square (color 2). In the output, the leftmost object (color 2) stays put, while the middle two objects (colors 6 & 5) swap places and orientations. The rightmost object (color 2) moves slightly upwards."
},
"overall_pattern": "Both examples demonstrate geometric transformations involving reflections, rotations, and translations. These operations seem to affect entire objects or parts of them, often altering their orientations and positions.",
"instructions": "To solve this task, you should identify the underlying pattern in the given input-output pairs. Focus on the changes occurring to individual pixels, as well as any modifications to the objects' properties (such as color, size, position, and shape). Use these observations to create a general description of the input-output relationship. Finally, apply this understanding to the test case input to produce the corresponding output grid.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[[9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4]]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The test input grid consists of nine pixels arranged in a 3x3 matrix. It contains four distinct colors - 9, 3, 4, and 6.",
"test_case_object_view": "There are six objects in the test input grid - three horizontal lines (colors 9, 3, and 4), two vertical lines (colors 4 & 6), and a single isolated pixel (color 9).",
"test_case_transformation": "Apply a series of geometric transformations to the input grid, including reflections, rotations, translations, and possibly other operations. This should result in a new arrangement of pixels and objects, still adhering to the same overall pattern observed in the input-output pairs.",
"test_case_output": "Create the resulting output grid by applying the described transformations to the test input grid. The output should be a 3x3 numpy array containing the modified pixel values and object arrangements."
