The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

I'll do my best to help you solve it.\n\nFirst, let's summarize what we know so far:\n\n* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, with 0 representing the background color.\n* The task involves transforming the input grid into a corresponding output grid using a specific pattern or rule.\n* The pattern involves relating individual pixels or objects in the grid to each other, possibly involving symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, scaling, and copy-paste operations.\n* The output grid will have the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two example input-output pairs provided:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nBased on these examples, it seems that the task involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and copying parts of the grid. The output grid maintains the same structure as the input grid but has different values assigned to some of the cells.\n\nTo formalize this process, we could define a set of rules or operations that take the input grid as input and produce the output grid as output. Here's a possible way to represent these rules:\n\n1. Flip the grid vertically (i.e., reflect it around the x-axis).\n2. Rotate the grid clockwise by 90 degrees.\n3. Scale the grid by a factor of 2 in both x and y directions (i.e., multiply each cell's coordinates by 2).\n4. Copy the top-left quarter of the grid and paste it in the bottom-right quarter.\n5. Copy the top-right quarter of the grid and paste it in the bottom-left quarter.\n6. Copy the middle row of the grid and paste it in the middle column.\n7. Set the value of the top-left cell to 1.\n8. Set the value of the bottom-right cell to 3.\n9. Set the value of the middle cell to 2.\n\nThese rules can be applied in any order, as long as they are applied consistently to the entire grid. For example, we could apply rule 1 first, followed by rule 2, then rule 3, and so on. Alternatively, we could start with rule 7, then apply rule 1, followed by rule 2, and so on. As long as we follow the same sequence of operations, the result should be the same.\n\nNow, let's try to generalize this process even further. Instead of hardcoding the rules, we could represent them as a set of parameters that define the transformation. For example:\n\n* Flip parameter: 0 for no flip, 1 for flip around the x-axis, -1 for flip around the y-axis.\n* Rotation parameter: 0 for no rotation, 1 for clockwise rotation by 90 degrees, -1 for counterclockwise rotation by 90 degrees.\n* Scaling parameter: 0 for no scaling, 1 for doubling in both x and y directions, -1 for halving in both x and y directions.\n* Copy-paste parameters: 0 for no copy-paste, 1 for copying the top-left quarter and pasting it in the bottom-right quarter, -1 for copying the top-right quarter and pasting it in the bottom-left quarter, 2 for copying the middle row and pasting it in the middle column.\n\nUsing these parameters, we can create a function that takes the input grid and applies the defined transformations in a flexible and efficient manner. The output grid will always have the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on solving the task! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
