[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[1, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8], [1, 1, 7, 7, 1, 8], [7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8]]
output: [[1, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8], [1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 8]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 7, 7, 1], [1, 8, 1, 7], [7, 1, 1, 7]]
output: [[5, 5, 5, 1], [1, 8, 1, 5], [5, 1, 1, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[1, 8, 1, 7, 1], [7, 8, 8, 1, 1], [7, 1, 8, 8, 7]]
output: [[1, 8, 1, 5, 1], [5, 8, 8, 1, 1], [5, 1, 8, 8, 5]]



Test case:
input: [[1, 7, 7, 1, 7], [8, 1, 7, 7, 7], [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first example has a horizontal line of three 8's in the middle, surrounded by 1's and 7's. The output replaces the central 8's with 5's, while maintaining the surrounding pixels unchanged.",
"object_changes": "There is one object in the input grid, colored 8, spanning three pixels horizontally in the center. The output shrinks the object by one pixel towards the left and right sides, changing its color to 5."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The second example features a vertical line of three 7's on the right side, flanked by 1's and 8's. The output replaces the central 7's with 5's, leaving the rest unaltered.",
"object_changes": "There is one object in the input grid, colored 7, spanning three pixels vertically on the right side. The output scales the object down by one pixel, changing its color to 5."
},
"overall_pattern": "Both examples exhibit a consistent pattern: replacing specific pixels in the middle of the grid with new values, while keeping the surrounding pixels intact. This suggests that the transformation applies to the entire grid, rather than individual objects.",
"instructions": "To apply the transformation, follow these steps:

1. Identify the central pixels in the input grid that need replacement. These will typically form a connected region, such as a horizontal or vertical line.
2. Replace the identified pixels with new values, taken from a predefined set (e.g., 5 in our examples). Ensure that the replaced pixels maintain their original position and neighbors.
3. Leave the remaining pixels in the grid unchanged.

Note that this transformation can be applied regardless of the specific object(s) present in the grid, as long as the central pixels follow the described pattern.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[[1, 7, 7, 1, 7], [8, 1, 7, 7, 7], [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The test input grid consists of three rows and five columns. The top row contains two 1's, followed by a 7 and another 1. The middle row is entirely filled with 7's, except for a lone 1 in the third column. The bottom row features an 8 in the first and last columns, with 7's elsewhere. There are no objects in this grid.",
"test_case_object_view": "No objects are present in the test input grid.",
"test_case_transformation": "Apply the general transformation rule to the test input grid, as described above.",
"test_case_output": "[[1, 7, 7, 1, 7], [5, 1, 7, 7, 5], [5, 7, 1, 7, 8]]"
