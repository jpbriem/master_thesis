You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]

Example_2:
input: [[5, 5, 2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]]



Test case:
input: [[6, 3, 5], [6, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid contains three objects - two yellow (3) and one blue (8). The output grid has three objects as well - two black (0) and one red (5). The yellow objects have moved to the bottom row, and the blue object has turned into a red object.",
"object_changes": "The yellow objects have changed color to black, and the blue object has changed color to red."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid contains three objects - two green (5) and one white (1). The output grid has three objects as well - two black (0) and one gray (2). The green objects have turned into black, and the white object has turned into gray.",
"object_changes": "The green objects have changed color to black, and the white object has changed color to gray."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship is based on geometric transformations such as reflections, rotations, and translations. The objects in the input grid are transformed into new objects in the output grid while maintaining their original shape and size. The pixel values of the input grid are also transformed accordingly.",
"instructions": "To solve this task, you need to apply the following steps:

1. Reflect the input grid vertically.
2. Rotate the reflected grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
3. Translate the rotated grid rightward by one pixel.
4. Replace the pixel values of the translated grid with the corresponding output pixel values.

The resulting grid will be the output grid.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[[6, 3, 5], [6, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0]]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The input grid has three rows and five columns. The top row consists of two yellow pixels, followed by a blue pixel in the middle row, and three green pixels in the bottom row. The leftmost column has a yellow pixel, followed by a green pixel, then a blue pixel, and finally two yellow pixels in the rightmost column.",
"test_case_object_view": "There are three objects in the input grid - two yellow objects and one blue object. The yellow objects are located in the top row, and the blue object is located in the middle row. The objects have a size of 3x3 pixels.",
"test_case_transformation": "The input grid needs to be transformed using the instructions provided above. The resulting grid will be the output grid.",
