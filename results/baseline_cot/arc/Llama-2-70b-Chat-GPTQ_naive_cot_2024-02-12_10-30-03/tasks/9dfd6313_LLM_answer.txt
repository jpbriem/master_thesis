[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[5, 0, 0], [3, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]
output: [[5, 3, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]

Example_2:
input: [[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0], [6, 0, 5, 0], [6, 0, 4, 5]]
output: [[5, 0, 6, 6], [0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 4], [0, 0, 0, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 5, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 5, 0], [0, 2, 0, 1, 5]]
output: [[5, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 5, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]



Test case:
input: [[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0], [2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first row has been reversed, with the first two pixels changed to 3 and 5 respectively, while the third pixel remains unchanged at 0.",
"object_changes": "There is one object in the input grid, colored 5, which has been moved to the second row and expanded to cover three pixels. It now touches an additional object of color 3."
},

"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The top-left corner has been modified, changing the 5 to a 6 and the 0 to a 4. The middle row has also been altered, replacing the lone 0 with a sequence of 5, 0, and 6 from left to right. Lastly, the bottom-right corner has had its 5 replaced with a 0.",
"object_changes": "Two objects are present in the input grid - one spanning four pixels horizontally across the top row (colored 5) and another occupying the bottom-left corner (colored 6). After transformation, there are still two objects, but their positions and sizes have shifted. The previously horizontal object has become vertical, stretching upward from the middle row, while the smaller object has moved slightly to the right and increased in size, now encompassing four pixels.",

"overall_pattern": "A consistent rotation and shifting of objects and pixels seems to occur between the input and output grids.",

"instructions": "To achieve this transformation, follow these steps:
1. Reverse the first row.
2. Move the top-left object down and expand it to cover three pixels.
3. Replace the lone 0 in the middle row with a sequence of 5, 0, and 6 from left to right.
4. Change the 5 in the bottom-right corner to a 0.",

"test_case_input_copy": "[[5, 0, 0], [3, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]",

"test_case_grid_view": "The test input grid contains nine pixels, arranged in rows of three each. The top-left corner shows a 5, followed by a 0 and another 5. The middle row consists of a 3, a 5, and a 0, while the bottom row holds a 0, a 0, and a final 5.",

"test_case_object_view": "One large object occupies the majority of the grid, spanning eight pixels horizontally across the top and middle rows. Its color is 5. A much smaller object of color 3 resides in the bottom-left corner, taking up just two pixels.",

"test_case_transformation": "Apply the following operations to transform the input grid:
1. Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Swap the top and bottom rows.
3. Move the top-left object down so that it touches the middle row.
4. Expand the top-left object to cover three pixels.
5. Replace the lone 0 in the middle row with a sequence of 5, 0, and 6 from left to right.
6. Change the 5 in the bottom-right corner to a 0.",

"test_case_output": "[[5, 3, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]"
