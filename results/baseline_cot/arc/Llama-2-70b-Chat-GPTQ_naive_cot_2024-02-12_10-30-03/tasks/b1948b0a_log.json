The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[6, 6, 7, 6], [6, 6, 7, 7], [7, 7, 6, 7]]\noutput: [[2, 2, 7, 2], [2, 2, 7, 7], [7, 7, 2, 7]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[7, 7, 7, 6], [6, 6, 7, 6], [7, 7, 6, 7], [7, 6, 7, 7], [7, 6, 7, 6], [6, 6, 6, 7]]\noutput: [[7, 7, 7, 2], [2, 2, 7, 2], [7, 7, 2, 7], [7, 2, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7, 2], [2, 2, 2, 7]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7], [7, 6, 7, 7, 6, 7]]\noutput: [[7, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 7, 2, 7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7, 7, 2, 7]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[6, 7, 7, 6], [6, 7, 6, 7], [7, 7, 7, 6], [7, 6, 7, 6]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  {\n\"example_1_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"The first example has a horizontal line of three 6's in the input grid, which becomes two 2's and a 7 in the output grid, still forming a horizontal line.\",\n\"object_changes\": \"There is one object in the input grid, colored 6, which shrinks by one pixel in the x-direction and remains unchanged in y-direction.\"\n},\n\"example_2_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"The second example has multiple connected regions of 7's and 6's in the input grid, which get rearranged into four separate regions in the output grid, still containing 7's and 6's but with changed positions and sizes.\",\n\"object_changes\": \"There are six objects in the input grid, each consisting of a group of connected pixels of the same color. In the output grid, these objects change their positions, sizes, and shapes while preserving their original colors.\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Both examples demonstrate a transformation that involves rearranging and resizing objects while maintaining their original colors. This suggests that the task requires identifying and manipulating individual objects within the grid, rather than simply applying global geometric transformations.\",\n\"instructions\": \"To solve this task, we need to identify the objects in the input grid, determine their properties like color, size, and position, and then apply appropriate transformations to move, resize, and rearrange them to match the output pattern. We must also ensure that the resulting output grid contains all necessary objects and has no unwanted artifacts or holes.\",\n\"test_case_input_copy\": \"Copy the test case input grid from the task.\",\n\"test_case_grid_view\": \"Describing the pixels of the entire grid, we see a 3x4 grid with values 6 and 7, indicating two objects of different colors.,\",\n\"test_case_object_view\": \"Regarding the objects, there are four objects in total, two objects of color 6 and two objects of color 7. They vary in size and position, with some objects overlapping.\",\n\"test_case_transformation\": \"To transform the grid, we should identify the individual objects and apply transformations such as translation, scaling, and rotation to move and resize them accordingly. Additionally, we may need to create new objects or remove existing ones to match the output pattern.\",\n\"test_case_output\": \"Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array.\"\n}"
