You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

First, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, with 0 representing the background color.
* The task involves transforming the input grid into a corresponding output grid using a specific pattern or rule.
* The pattern involves relating the entire grid or individual objects in the grid.
* Objects are defined as adjacent pixels of the same color.
* The transformation can involve geometric and topological operations such as lines, rectangular shapes, connecting points, orthogonal projections, symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, scaling, and flipping.
* The transformation can also involve arithmetical operations such as counting, sorting, and manipulating objects or shapes.

Now, let's analyze the input-output pairs you provided:

1. Example 1:
Input: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

From this example, we can observe that the transformation involves copying a section of the grid and pasting it elsewhere while maintaining the same relative positions of the objects. Specifically, the top-left corner of the grid is copied and pasted to the bottom-right corner, while the top-right corner is copied and pasted to the bottom-left corner. The objects remain unchanged, but their coordinates are adjusted accordingly.

1. Example 2:
Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

This example involves a similar transformation as the first one, but with a different layout. The top-left and bottom-right corners are still copied and pasted, but the top-right and bottom-left corners are now swapped. Again, the objects remain unchanged, but their coordinates are adjusted accordingly.

1. Example 3:
Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

In this example, we see a more complex transformation involving multiple copies and pastes. The top-left and bottom-right corners are copied and pasted as before, but now the top-right and bottom-left corners are swapped, and the middle row is inverted. Additionally, the objects are moved around to accommodate the new layout.

Based on these examples, we can deduce some general principles about the transformation:

* The transformation involves copying and pasting parts of the grid while maintaining the relative positions of the objects.
* The transformation can involve flipping and inverting rows or columns.
* The transformation can move objects around to fit the new layout.
* The transformation preserves the orientation of the objects.

Using these principles, we can create a algorithm to generate the output grid given the input grid. Here's an outline of the algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty output grid.
2. Identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of the input grid.
3. Copy the top-left corner of the input grid and paste it to the bottom-right corner of the output grid.
4. Copy the top-right corner of the input grid and paste it to the bottom-left corner of the output grid.
5. Copy the middle row of the input grid, invert it, and paste it to the appropriate position in the output grid.
6. Move objects around in the output grid as necessary to fit the new layout.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the entire grid has been transformed.
8. Return the output grid.
