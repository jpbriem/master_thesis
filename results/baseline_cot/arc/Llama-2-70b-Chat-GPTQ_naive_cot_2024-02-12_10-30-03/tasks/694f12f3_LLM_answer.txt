prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
  The given input-output pairs exhibit a similarity in their transformation patterns. Based on this observation, we can infer that the task requires us to apply a specific transformation to the input grid, which will result in the corresponding output grid.

To describe the transformation, let's define some terms:

* A "line" refers to a sequence of adjacent pixels of the same color.
* A "rectangle" refers to a set of pixels forming a rectangle, where all pixels have the same color.
* A "shape" refers to a set of pixels forming a connected region, where all pixels have the same color.

Now, let's describe the transformation pattern:

1. Find the largest rectangle in the input grid.
2. Split the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, each having a side length of half the original rectangle's side length.
3. Rotate the two smaller rectangles by 90 degrees clockwise relative to each other.
4. Place the two rectangles side by side, ensuring that their long sides touch.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until there are no more rectangles that can be split.
6. Fill any remaining empty spaces with copies of the background color (zero).
7. Return the resulting grid as the output.

Here's an example of how this transformation would work for the first input-output pair:

Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]]

Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]]

The resulting output grid has the same structure as the input grid but with different pixel values. The transformation applied to the input grid created four identical copies of the original shape, each shifted by 90 degrees.
