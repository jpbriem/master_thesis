You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

First, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, with 0 representing the background color.
* We need to transform the input grid into a corresponding output grid using a specific transformation pattern.
* The transformation pattern involves geometric and topological operations such as lines, rectangular shapes, connecting points, orthogonal projections, symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, scaling, and elastic distortions.
* The transformation also involves copying, repeating, and pattern-based operations based on sections.
* Objects in the grid are defined as sets of adjacent pixels with the same color, and can be transformed based on their color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.
* Noise pixels may also be present in the grid.

Now, let's analyze the input-output pairs you provided:

1. Example 1:
Input: [[1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[1, 2, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

From this example, we can observe that the transformation involves replacing each pixel with a neighboring pixel of a different color, while maintaining the same relative position. Specifically, the top-left corner pixel (color 1) is replaced by the bottom-left corner pixel (color 2), while the top-right corner pixel (also color 1) is replaced by the bottom-right corner pixel (again color 2). The remaining pixels remain unchanged.

1. Example 2:
Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

This example introduces new elements:

* A vertical line of color 1 appears in the middle of the grid, dividing it into two parts.
* Two objects of color 2 appear, one in the top-left corner and another in the bottom-right corner.
* Some pixels in the grid change color from 0 to 1.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the transformation involves the following steps:

1. Draw a vertical line dividing the grid into two parts.
2. Create two objects of color 2, one in the top-left corner and another in the bottom-right corner.
3. Replace some pixels in the grid with color 1.

1. Example 3:
Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0], [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

In this example, we see additional elements:

* A horizontal line of color 1 appears at the midpoint of the grid.
* Two objects of color 2 move towards the center of the grid.
* Some pixels in the grid change color from 0 to 1.

We can infer the following steps from this example:

1. Draw a horizontal line dividing the grid into two parts.
2. Move two objects of color 2 towards the center of the grid.
3. Replace some pixels in the grid with color 1.

Given these three input-output pairs, we can now attempt to generalize the rules for the given task:

1. The grid is divided into two parts by either a horizontal or vertical line.
2. Two objects of color 2 appear, one in the top-left corner and another in the bottom-right
