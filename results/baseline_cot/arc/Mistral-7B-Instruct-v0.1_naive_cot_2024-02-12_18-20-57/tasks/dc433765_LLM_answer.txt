prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the information you requested:

{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'Regarding the first example, the changes between the input and output pixels focus on the pattern of the grid. Specifically, the output has the same pattern as the input but with some pixels flipped horizontally. For instance, the pixel at position (0, 1) in the input becomes the pixel at position (1, 0) in the output, and so on. This change affects only the pixels that are part of an object. In this case, there is only one object, which consists of three pixels with color 2. Therefore, the object remains unchanged in the output.', 'object_changes': 'In the first example, the changes between the input and output objects focus on their positions and sizes. Specifically, the object at position (0, 1) in the input becomes the object at position (1, 0) in the output, and its size increases slightly. There are no other changes in the objects or their colors.'}, 'example_2_description': 'This example is similar to the first one, except that the objects are flipped vertically instead of horizontally. The pattern of the grid also remains the same. Therefore, the description of the pixel and object changes applies here as well.', 'overall_pattern': 'Both examples involve flipping the objects horizontally or vertically while keeping the pattern of the grid intact. This means that the input and output grids have the same pattern, but the objects may be moved or flipped relative to each other. The objects themselves remain unchanged in terms of their color or size.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:
1. Flip the objects horizontally or vertically depending on the example.
2. Keep the pattern of the grid intact.
3. Ensure that the objects maintain their original color and size.', 'test_case_input_copy': 'Copy the test case input grid from the task.', 'test_case_grid_view': 'Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns. The grid has dimensions (2, 5). The pixels are arranged as follows: \n\n   |   |   |   |   |\n   |   |   |   |   |\n   |   |   |   |   |\n   |   |   |   |   |\n   |   |   |   |   |\n   |   |   |   |   |\n\nThe pattern of the grid consists of alternating rows of black and white pixels. Each row contains five pixels. The first row is black, followed by four white rows, then another black row, and finally four more white rows. This pattern continues throughout the grid. However, the objects in the grid break this pattern. There are two objects in total. The first object consists of three black pixels located at positions (0, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 2). The second object consists of three white pixels located at positions (1, 3), (1, 4), and (1, 5).', 'test_case_object_view': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, and movement. There are two objects in the grid. The first object consists of three black pixels located at positions (0, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 2). Its color is black, and its size is 3x1. The second object consists of three white pixels located at positions (1, 3), (1, 4), and (1, 5). Its color is white, and its size is also 3x1. Both objects move horizontally across the grid. The first object moves from left to right, while the second object moves from right to left.
