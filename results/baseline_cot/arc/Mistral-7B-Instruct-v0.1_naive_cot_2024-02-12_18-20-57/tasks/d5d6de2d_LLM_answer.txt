prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Overall pattern:

* The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
* Each pixel in the input grid has a value between 1 and 9, except for the background color, which is 0.
* The output grid also has values between 1 and 9, except for the background color, which is 0.
* The output grid has the same number of objects as the input grid.
* Each object in the input grid corresponds to an object in the output grid.
* The objects in the input and output grids may have different colors, sizes, coordinates, shapes, and numbers.
* The objects in the input and output grids may touch each other or not.
* There may be noise pixels in both the input and output grids.

Instructions:

1. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. For each row, iterate through each column.
3. If the current cell has a value greater than 0, check if it touches any adjacent cells that have a value greater than 0.
4. If the current cell does not touch any adjacent cells that have a value greater than 0, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to 0.
5. If the current cell touches at least one adjacent cell that has a value greater than 0, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to the maximum value among all adjacent cells that have a value greater than 0.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for all rows and columns in the input grid.
7. Return the output grid as a numpy array.

Test case input copy:
```python
[[2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]]
```
Test case grid view:
The input grid has 5 rows and 5 columns. The first row has two 2's, followed by a 0, a 2, and another 2. The second row has a 2, a 0, a 2, and another 2. The third row has three 2's, followed by a 0, a 2, and another 2. The fourth row has a 0, a 2, a 2, and another 2. The fifth row has two 2's, followed by a 0, a 2, and another 2.

Test case object view:
There are five objects in the input grid. Object 1 has coordinates (1, 1), size 3x3, color 2, and number 1. Object 2 has coordinates (2, 1), size 3x3, color 2, and number 1. Object 3 has coordinates (1, 2), size 3x3, color 2, and number 1. Object 4 has coordinates (2, 2), size 3x3, color 2, and number 1. Object 5 has coordinates (1, 3), size 3x3, color 2, and number 1.

Test case transformation:
For each object in the input grid, check if it touches any adjacent objects that have a value greater than 0. If it does not touch any adjacent objects that have a value greater than 0, set the corresponding object in the output grid to 0. If it touches at least one adjacent object that has a value greater than 0, set the corresponding object in the output grid to the maximum value among all adjacent objects that have a value greater than 0.
