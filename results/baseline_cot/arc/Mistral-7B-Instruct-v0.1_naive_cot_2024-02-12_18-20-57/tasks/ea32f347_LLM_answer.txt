prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the description of the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs:

Overall pattern:
For each input grid, the output grid will have the same dimensions but with some differences in pixel values. Specifically, the output grid will contain the same objects as the input grid, but their positions may change. Additionally, the output grid may also contain new objects that were not present in the input grid.

Instructions:
To create the output grid, follow these steps:

1. For each object in the input grid, check if it touches any other objects horizontally or vertically. If an object does touch another object, move it to the right or left until it no longer touches the other object.
2. If there are two objects that touch each other horizontally or vertically, merge them into a single object. This merged object should have the same color as the original objects.
3. If there are two objects that do not touch each other, but they are adjacent to each other, merge them into a single object. This merged object should have a different color than the original objects.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all objects in the input grid.
5. Add any new objects that were created during the merging process to the output grid. These new objects should have a different color than the existing objects.
6. Fill in any empty spaces in the output grid with noise pixels.

Test case input copy:
Copy the test case input grid from the task.

Test case grid view:
Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.
The test input grid has the following pixels:
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
The grid contains several objects, including two objects with the color `5`, which are touching each other horizontally. There are also three objects with the color `0`.

Test case object view:
Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, and movement, shape, and object number.
The test input grid contains the following objects:
```yaml
Object 1:
Color: 5
Size: 5x5
Coordinates: (1, 1)
Movement: None
Shape: Square
Number: 2

Object 2:
Color: 5
Size: 5x5
Coordinates: (4, 4)
Movement: None
Shape: Square
Number: 2

Object 3:
Color: 0
Size: 5x5
Coordinates: (0, 0)
Movement: None
Shape: Square
Number: 1
```
There are two objects with the color `5`, which are touching each other horizontally. There are also three objects with the color `0`.

Test case transformation:
Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed.
The grid should be transformed such that the two objects with the color `5` are merged into a single object. The merged object should have the same color as the original objects. Additionally, the three objects with the color `0` should remain unchanged. Any empty spaces in the output grid should be filled with noise pixels.
