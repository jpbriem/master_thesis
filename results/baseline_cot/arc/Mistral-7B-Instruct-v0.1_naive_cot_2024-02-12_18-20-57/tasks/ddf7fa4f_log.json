            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

In this case, the input and output grids represent the same image, but with some modifications applied to the objects.\n\nHere's an explanation of each field:\n\n* `example_1_description`: This section describes the changes made to the input pixels and objects in Example 1. For example, it could say something like:\n\t+ Pixel changes: In the output grid, every pixel has the same value as its corresponding pixel in the input grid. However, there are two exceptions:\n\t\t- Every pixel with a value of 2 in the input grid has been replaced with a value of 6 in the output grid.\n\t\t- Every pixel with a value of 6 in the input grid has been replaced with a value of 0 in the output grid.\n\t+ Object changes: There are no changes made to the objects in the output grid compared to the input grid.\n* `example_2_description`: This section provides a brief description of Example 2, which is not included in the provided examples.\n* `overall_pattern`: This section describes the general pattern used to transform the input grids into output grids. It could say something like:\n\t+ The input and output grids represent the same image, but with some modifications applied to the objects. Specifically, every object in the input grid has been replaced with a new object in the output grid that has the same color, size, and shape, but may be located at a different position in the grid.\n* `instructions`: This section provides detailed instructions on how to transform the input grids into output grids. It could say something like:\n\t+ To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:\n\t\t1. Iterate through each object in the input grid.\n\t\t2. For each object, find the corresponding object in the output grid that has the same color, size, and shape.\n\t\t3. If the corresponding object in the output grid is located at a different position than the original object in the input grid, move the object in the output grid to the correct position.\n\t\t4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all objects in the input grid.\n* `test_case_input_copy`: This section provides instructions on how to copy the test case input grid from the task. It could say something like:\n\t+ To copy the test case input grid from the task, simply create a new variable that contains a deep copy of the input grid.\n* `test_case_grid_view`: This section provides a description of the pixels in the entire grid of the test case input, focusing on patterns. It could say something like:\n\t+ The test case input grid consists of a 2D array of integers, where each integer represents the color of a pixel in the grid. The grid has dimensions (5, 5), meaning"
