Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". What is the difference between your expected and actual outputs?

Comment: @MichaelHampton The difference is that in my code the output for test case 4 is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, while the expected output is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

## Answer (1)

You can use a dictionary to store the counts of each number. Then iterate over the list and update the count of each number as needed. Finally, return the list with the counts.

Here is an implementation:

```
def count_numbers(lst):
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    return list(counts.values())
```

This function works correctly on all of the examples you provided.
