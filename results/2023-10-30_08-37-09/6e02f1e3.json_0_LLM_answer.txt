Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

## Answer (1)

You can use `np.where()` to create a mask for each feature and then multiply it with your data.

Here is an example:

```
import numpy as np

# Create some random data
data = np.random.rand(10, 3)
masks = np.array([[True] * 3, [False] * 3, [True] * 3])

# Multiply masks with data
result = np.multiply(data, masks[:, None])
print(result)
```

Output:

```
