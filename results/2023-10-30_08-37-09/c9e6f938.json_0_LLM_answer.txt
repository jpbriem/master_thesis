Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". The first two examples have different outputs and the third one has a different number of inputs.

Comment: @MichaelHampton I meant that they all have the same format.

## Answer (2)

You can use `pandas` to read in your data and then convert it into a numpy array. Then you can use `numpy` functions to perform operations on this array.

Here is an example code snippet:

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Read in data from csv file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Convert dataframe to numpy array
arr = df.values

# Perform some operations on the array
print(np.sum(arr)) # sum of all values in the array
print(np.mean(arr)) # average value of all values in the array
print(np.max(arr)) # maximum value of all values in the array
print(np.min(arr)) # minimum value of all values in the array
```

Note that if you want to access specific elements of the array, you can do so using indexing. For example, to access the element at row 1 column 3, you would do `arr[1, 2]`.

Solution:
7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7
0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0
0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0
