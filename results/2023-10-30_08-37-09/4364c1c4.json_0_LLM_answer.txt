Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict on test data that is different from the training data, then you need a model that can generalize well. You should try using a more complex model (e.g., one with more layers or more neurons per layer) and see if it improves performance.

## Answer (0)

You are using a very simple neural network architecture which is not enough for this problem. The number of hidden units in each layer should be at least 50% of the number of features in the input. Also, you should use ReLU activation function instead of sigmoid.

Here is an example code snippet using TensorFlow:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load data
X =... # input features
y =... # target variable

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define neural network architecture
inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(len(X_train[0]),))
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=100, activation='relu')(inputs)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(rate=0.2)(x)
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=0)

# Evaluate model
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', acc)
```
