Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict a sequence that is different from any in your training set, then you need to use a model trained on a larger dataset (or one with more diverse sequences).

## Answer (0)

I think you are trying to generate a sequence of numbers based on some rule or pattern. In this case, it would be better to use a recurrent neural network (RNN), such as LSTM or GRU. These models can learn patterns and dependencies between elements in a sequence. You can find many tutorials online about how to implement these models in Python using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
