Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict the same values for the test set as you did in the training set, then you can just use the first column of your `predictions` array.

## Answer (1)

You are using a different model than the one used during training. You should re-fit the model on the training data and then make predictions on the test data.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates this:

```
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris['data']
y = iris['target']

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# Train logistic regression model
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

print('Predicted labels:', y_pred)
```
