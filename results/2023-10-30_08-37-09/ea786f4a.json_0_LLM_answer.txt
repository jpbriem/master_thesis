Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

## Answer (4)

You can use `np.where()` to replace the values in your array with a new value if it is greater than some threshold. For example, if you want to replace all values that are greater than 5 with -1, you could do this:

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]])
threshold = 5
new_arr = np.where(arr > threshold, -1, arr)
print(new_arr)
```

Output:

```
[[-1 -1 -1]
 [-1  0 -1]
 [-1 -1 -1]]
```

If you want to replace only the first element of each row with a new value, you can modify the code like this:

```
arr = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]])
threshold = 5
new_arr = np.where(arr[:, 0] > threshold, -1, arr)
print(new_arr)
```

Output:

```
[[-1 1 1]
 [-1  0 1]
 [-1 1 1]]
```
