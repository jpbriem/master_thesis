Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict a value for each test sample that is the same as the corresponding value in the training set, then you can just use the first column of your training set as the predictions.

## Answer (0)

You need to change your model architecture. You are using a single dense layer with one neuron and no activation function. This means that your model will always output the same value regardless of the inputs.

To fix this, you should add another dense layer with an activation function such as ReLU or sigmoid. Then you can train your model on the training data and make predictions on the test data.

1, 2, 3, 8, 4
