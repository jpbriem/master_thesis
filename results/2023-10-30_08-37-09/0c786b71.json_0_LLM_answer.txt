Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict a test set with the same model that was trained on the training set, then yes, it should be the same. But if you want to compare the predictions made by two different models (e.g., one trained on the training set and another trained on a subset), then no, they won't necessarily be the same.

## Answer (1)

The answer is **No**. The reason for this is because the `predict()` function uses the `model_fit()` function which trains the model using the entire dataset. So when you call `predict(X_test, y_test)`, it will use the entire dataset to make predictions. However, in your case, you are only using a portion of the dataset to train the model. Therefore, the predictions made by the two models will differ.
