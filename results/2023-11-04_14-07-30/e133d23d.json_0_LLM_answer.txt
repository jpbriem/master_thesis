The issue with the code is that the `train` input is not being properly defined. The `train` input should be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the input matrix. In the current code, the `train` input is being defined as a list of lists, but it is not being properly defined. 

To fix this issue, the `train` input should be defined as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the input matrix. Here is the corrected code:

```
train input:
[[0, 0, 6, 4, 8, 8, 0],
 [0, 6, 0, 4, 8, 8, 0],
