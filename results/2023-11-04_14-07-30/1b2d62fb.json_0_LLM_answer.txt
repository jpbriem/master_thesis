The issue with the code is that the `train input` is not being properly defined. The `train input` should be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the input matrix. In the current code, the `train input` is being defined as a list of lists, but it is not being properly defined. 

To fix this issue, the `train input` should be defined as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the input matrix. Here is the corrected code:

```
train input:
[[0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],
 [9, 0, 0, 1, 9, 0, 9],
 [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],
 [0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],

 [0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],
