The issue with the code is that the `train input` is not being properly defined. The `train input` should be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the input matrix. In the current code, the `train input` is being defined as a list of lists, but the inner lists are not being properly defined. 

To fix this issue, the `train input` should be defined as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the input matrix. The inner lists should be defined as lists of integers, where each element represents the number of elements in the row. 

Here's the corrected code:

```

def train_input(n):
    train_input = np.zeros((n,n))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
