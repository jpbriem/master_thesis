Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". What is the difference between your two examples?

Comment: @MichaelHampton The first one has a different number of columns in the test and train data.

## Answer (1)

You can use `pandas` to read the csv files into dataframes and then use `numpy` to perform the operations on them. Here is an example code snippet that should work for you:

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Read the training data from the csv file
train_df = pd.read_csv('training_data.csv')

# Read the testing data from the csv file
test_df = pd.read_csv('testing_data.csv')

# Perform the necessary operations on the training data
X_train = train_df[['a', 'b']]
y_train = train_df['c']

# Perform the necessary operations on the testing data
X_test = test_df[['a', 'b']]
y_test = test_df['c']

# Use numpy to perform matrix multiplication
result = np.dot(X_train, X_test)
print(result)
```

Note that this assumes that the column names in the csv files match the column names used in the code above. If they don't match, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.
