Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". The first two examples have different outputs and the third one has a different number of inputs.

Comment: @MichaelHampton I edited my question to clarify that.

## Answer (3)

You can use `numpy` to create arrays from your lists. Then you can use `np.array()` to convert them into numpy nd-arrays. You can then use these nd-arrays as inputs for your model.

Here is an example:

```
import numpy as np

# Create numpy nd-arrays from lists
X = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]])
y = np.array([0, 2])

# Use nd-arrays as inputs for model
model.predict(X)
```

Note that in this case, you will need to reshape your data if it is currently 1D. For example, if your data is currently:

```
X = [[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]]
```

Then you would need to reshape it like this:

```
X = X.reshape((len(X), -1))
```

This tells numpy to automatically infer the shape of the array based on its contents.
