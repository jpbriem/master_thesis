Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict a sequence that is different from the training data, then you need to use a model trained on a larger dataset (i.e., one that includes sequences like the test data).

## Answer (0)

I think you are trying to generate a sequence with the same length as your training set. You can do this using the `predict()` function in Keras. Here is an example:

```
# Generate some random data for demonstration purposes
X_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(5, 3))
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(5, 3))

# Create a simple LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=1, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(3, 1)))
model.add(Dense(1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=1)

# Predict the next value in each sequence
predictions = model.predict(X_train)
print(predictions)
```

This will print out the predicted values for each sequence in `X_train`. Note that the `input_shape` parameter specifies the shape of the input data, which should match the shape of the training data. In this case, we specify `(3, 1)`, since each sequence has three elements and one feature.
