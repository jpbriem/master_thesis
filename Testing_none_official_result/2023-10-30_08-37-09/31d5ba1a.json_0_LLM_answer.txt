Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

## Answer (1)

I think you need to change your `train_output` and `test_output` variables in order to match the expected values.

For example, if you want to predict a value of 6 for the first test case, then you should set `train_output[0] = 6`, `train_output[1] = 6`, `train_output[2] = 6`, `train_output[3] = 6`, `train_output[4] = 6`.

Similarly, you should set `test_output[0] = 6`, `test_output[1] = 6`, `test_output[2] = 6`, `test_output[3] = 6`, `test_output[4] = 6`.

You can do this manually or you can use numpy arrays to create these arrays with one line of code.

Solution:
0, 0, 6, 6, 6
6, 0, 0, 6, 0
6, 6, 0, 6, 6
