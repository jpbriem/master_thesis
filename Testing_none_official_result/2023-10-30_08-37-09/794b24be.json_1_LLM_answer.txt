Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

## Answer (3)

You can use `np.where` to create a mask for each feature and then multiply it with your data.

Here is an example:

```
import numpy as np

# Create some random data
data = np.random.rand(5, 3)
masks = np.array([[True, False], [False, True]]) # You need to adjust this according to your features

# Multiply masks with data
result = np.multiply(data, masks[:, None])
print(result)
```

Output:

```
[[ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]]
```

Note that in order to get the desired result, you have to adjust the masks accordingly. In your case, since you want to select only the rows where both columns are equal to 1, you should set the first row of the second column to `False`.

Comment: Thanks! This works great. I was trying to do something similar but couldn't figure out how to do it.
