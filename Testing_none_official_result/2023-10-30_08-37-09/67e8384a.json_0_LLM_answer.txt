Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict the next value in a sequence, then you need to have a model that can take in a sequence and produce a prediction for the next value. You don't seem to be doing that here.

Comment: @MichaelChambers I am trying to predict the next value in a sequence. The problem is that the model does not know how many values are in the sequence. So it has to predict the next value based on the previous values.

I think you should use `predict_proba()` instead of `predict()`. This will give you probabilities for each class. Then you can choose the one with highest probability.

Here is an example:

```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
clf.fit(X, y)

# Predicting the target variable for the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
print("Predicted values:", predictions)

# Probability of each class for each sample
probabilities = clf.predict_proba(X_test)
print("Probabilities:\n", probabilities)
```
