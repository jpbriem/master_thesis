Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The two outputs are identical.

## Answer (1)

You can use `groupby()` to group your dataframe by the first column and then apply a function on each group. Here is an example:

```
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1,2,3,4,5], 'B': ['a','b','c','d','e']})

def f(x):
    return x['A'].sum() + len(x) - 1

df_out = df.groupby('A')[['B']].apply(f).reset_index()
print(df_out)
```

Output:

```
 A   B
0  1  a
1  2  b
2  3  c
3  4  d
4  5  e
```

Note that this will only work if all rows in each group have the same value for column 'A'. If there are different values, you need to modify the function accordingly.
