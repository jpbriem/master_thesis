Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same inputs". The first two examples have different outputs and the last two examples have different inputs.

Comment: @MichaelChambers I meant that the inputs are the same in both cases.

## Answer (1)

The problem is that your model is not learning anything useful. You can see this from the fact that the model predicts the same output for all test inputs. This happens because the model has no way to distinguish between the different classes.

To fix this, you need to add more features to your model. In this case, it seems like a good idea to use one-hot encoding for each feature. For example, instead of using `[6, 6]`, you could use `[[6], [6]]`. Similarly, instead of using `[5, 0]`, you could use `[[5], [0]]`.

You should also consider adding some regularization to your model to prevent overfitting. One option is to use L2 regularization with a small value such as 0.01. Another option is to use dropout during training.
