Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict the next value in a sequence, then you need to use a recurrent neural network (RNN). You can find many examples online for this type of problem.

## Answer (1)

You are using a feedforward neural network which is not suitable for sequential prediction tasks. For such tasks you should use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

Here is an example of how to implement LSTM in Python with Keras:

```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM

# define model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])))
model.add(Dense(units=1))

# compile model
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

# fit model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=1)

# make predictions on test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

Note that you will also need to preprocess your data so that it is in the correct format for the LSTM. This may involve reshaping your data and possibly one-hot encoding your labels.
