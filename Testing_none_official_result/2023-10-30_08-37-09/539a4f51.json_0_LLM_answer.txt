Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict the same values for the test set as you did in the training set, then you can just use the `predict()` function on the test set and it will return the predicted values.

## Answer (1)

You need to change your model to be able to handle multiple inputs. You have a single input with 5 features, but you are trying to predict a single value.

If you want to predict a single value based on multiple inputs, you should create a new model that takes in multiple inputs and outputs a single value. For example, if you wanted to predict the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, etc., you would create a model like this:

```
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model using the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

In this case, `X_train` is a matrix where each row represents a house and each column represents a feature (size, number of bedrooms, etc.). Similarly, `X_test` is a matrix where each row represents a house in the test set and each column represents a feature. The `y_train` variable contains the prices of all the houses in the training set, and the `y_pred` variable will contain the predicted prices of all the houses in the test set.
