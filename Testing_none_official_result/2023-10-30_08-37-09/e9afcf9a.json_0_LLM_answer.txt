Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict a value that is different from any in your training set, then you need to use a model that can generalize well. You could try using a neural network with more hidden layers or neurons per layer.

## Answer (1)

You are trying to fit a linear regression model on a dataset where there is no linear relationship between the features and the target variable. This is why you get such bad predictions.

If you have a dataset like this, you should consider using a non-linear model such as a neural network.
