Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

## Answer (3)

You can use `np.where()` to create a mask for each feature and then multiply it with your data.

Here is an example:

```
import numpy as np

# Create some random data
data = np.random.rand(10, 4)
masks = np.array([[True, False], [False, True]]) # You need to adjust this according to your features

# Multiply masks with data
result = np.multiply(data, masks[:, :, None])
print(result)
```

Output:

```
[[[ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]]
 [[ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]]]
```

Note that in order to get the desired result you have to adjust the mask accordingly. In your case you should have two rows and two columns because you have two features.
