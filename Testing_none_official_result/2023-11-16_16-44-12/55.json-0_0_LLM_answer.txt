LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, i, a], [i, i, i], [a, i, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a 3 by 3 grid filled with different colored squares.
To make the output, you have to see which design you have. if you have two black lines that are 2 squares long, one coming down from the top left, and one going left from the bottom right, your output will be a green square.If you have a grey cross that is filled in, your output is a magenta square. If you have a black cross, with the middle square filled in with a different color, your output will be an orangey red. If you have a cross of a different color, with the middle square black, and the upper left square filled in with the color as well, then your output will be a blue square.
The output grid size will change to a 1 by 1 square.

LLM answer:


Output grid: [[green]]

Example output:
{
    'input_grid': 'A 3x3 grid with three rows and three columns. Each cell contains a different color.',
    'instructions': 'See which design you have. If you have two black lines that are 2 squares long, one coming down from the top left, and one going left from the bottom right, your output will be a green square. If you have a grey cross that is filled in, your output is a magenta square. If you have a black cross, with the middle square filled in with a different color, your output will be an orangey red. If you have a cross of a different color, with the middle square black, and the upper left square filled in with the color as well, then your output will be a blue square. The output grid size will change to a 1x1 square.',
    'output_dimension': '1x1',
    'test_output': [[green]]
