Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just learns how to map inputs to outputs. It can be used for classification (i.e., mapping an input vector to a class), but that's not really relevant here.

Answer: You are correct in your assumption that the neural network will learn to identify the pattern. However, there are some things you need to consider when training and testing your model.

Firstly, you should make sure that your test data is different from your training data. This means that you shouldn't use the same images or sequences as both training and test data. Otherwise, your model may overfit on the training data and perform poorly on unseen data.

Secondly, you should also consider using cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross validation or leave one out cross validation to evaluate your model performance more accurately. These methods help ensure that all parts of your dataset get tested equally so that any biases present in either part donâ€™t affect overall results too much.
