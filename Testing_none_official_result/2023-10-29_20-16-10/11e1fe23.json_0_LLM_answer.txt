Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just learns how to map inputs to outputs based on training data. If your training data has a pattern in it then that will be reflected in the weights learned by the neural net. But if there isn't any pattern (e.g., random noise) then the network won't learn anything useful and its predictions will also be random noise.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to understand why my network does not generalize well when I use a sigmoid activation function for the hidden layer neurons.
\end{blockquote}

The problem with using a sigmoid as an activation function is that it saturates at both ends. This means that the gradient becomes very small near zero or one, which makes learning difficult. In fact, this can cause the optimization algorithm to get stuck in local minima.

This is especially true for deep networks because each layer amplifies the effect of the previous layers. So even if only some of the layers have saturating activations, they can still make learning difficult.

There are two main ways to deal with this problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use non-saturating activations like ReLU or tanh instead of sigmoid. These functions don't saturate so they allow gradients to flow through them more easily. However, they may introduce other problems like vanishing/exploding gradients depending on how they're used.
\item Add regularization terms to penalize large weights or biases. This helps prevent overfitting by encouraging smaller values for these parameters. It also reduces the risk of getting stuck in local minima since it pushes away from regions where gradients become too small due to saturation effects.
\end{itemize}
