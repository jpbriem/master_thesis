Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error function. It can be used for classification (i.e., recognizing a pattern), but that's only one possible use case.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I am trying to understand how neural networks work and I have been reading some tutorials on the internet. However, they all seem to assume that we already know how neural networks work.
\end{blockquote}

This is because there are many different types of neural nets with different architectures and learning algorithms. There is no single tutorial which will explain everything in detail. You need to read several tutorials and books to get an overview of the field.

\begin{blockquote}

The first thing I don't understand is why do we need to normalise our inputs?
\end{blockquote}

Because otherwise your weights would grow very large or small, depending on the scale of your data. This makes training much harder.

\begin{blockquote}

Also, if we normalise our inputs, then wouldn't this make the problem easier since now every input has the same value?
\end{blockquote}

No, because the outputs still vary greatly. Normalization does not change the relative values between inputs.

\begin{blockquote}

What happens when we have two inputs with the same value? Does the network treat them as the same input?
\end{blockquote}

Yes, exactly. That's the whole point of normalization.

\begin{blockquote}

If so, then why do we even bother having multiple inputs at all? Why not just have one input instead of ten?
\end{blockquote}

You could do that, but it would probably result in worse performance. Having more inputs allows the net to learn more complex functions.

\begin{blockquote}

How does the network know whether the input is a 0 or a 1?
\end{blockquote}

It doesn't. It just learns to associate certain input vectors with certain output vectors. Whether those inputs represent zeros or ones is irrelevant.

\begin{blockquote}

Does it simply look at the number of 1s in each row and compare it to the number of 1s in the corresponding row in the test set?
\end{blockquote}

No, it looks at the entire vector. If you want to classify individual bits, you should use a separate neuron per
