Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two numbers are the same". The first number is always `7`, and the second number is either `0` or `7`.

Answer: You can use [`itertools.groupby`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby) to group consecutive runs of the same value in a list. For example, if your input were `[7, 7, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0]`, then `list(groupby([7, 7, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0]))` would return `[(7, [7]), (0, [0]), (1, [1]), (5, [5]), (0, [0])]`. This lets us easily find all the groups of adjacent values that have the same value as their neighbors.

Here's how we could use this to solve your problem:

\begin{code}
from itertools import groupby

def get_neighbours(input):
    for k, g in groupby(input):
        yield k, len(list(g))

def get_output(input):
    # Find all the groups of adjacent values with the same value as their neighbors
    neighbours = [(k, n) for k, n in get_neighbours(input)]

    # If there are no such groups, return an empty list
    if not neighbours:
        return []

    # Otherwise, return a list containing the length of each group
    return [n for _, n in neighbours]

print(get_output([7, 7, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0]))
>>> [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
\end{code}
