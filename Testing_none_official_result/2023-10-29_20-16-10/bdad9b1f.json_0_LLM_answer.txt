Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two numbers are the x and y coordinates". The first number is the x coordinate, and the second number is the y coordinate? Or do you mean that the first *pair* of numbers is the x coordinate, and the second pair is the y coordinate? If so, then your test case doesn't match up with this description.

This takes a list of lists as input (e.g., `[[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[8,0],[0,0]]` for the first training set). It returns a function which can be applied to an array of arrays in order to get the desired result.

The algorithm works like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each point, find its distance from the origin using [Pythagoras' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem), i.e., `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`.
\item Find the maximum distance among all points.
\item Divide each point's distance by the maximum distance. This gives us a value between 0 and 1 for each point.
\item Multiply each point's value by 8. This gives us a value between 0 and 8 for each point.
\item Round each point's value down to the nearest integer. This gives us a value between 0 and 8 inclusive for each point.
\item Add 1 to each point's value. This gives us a value between 1 and 9 inclusive for each point.
\end{itemize}
