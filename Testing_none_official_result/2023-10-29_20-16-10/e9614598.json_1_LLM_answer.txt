Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The neural net doesn't know anything about patterns or images; it just has a bunch of weights and biases that are adjusted during training so as to minimize some error function. It can be used for image recognition if you have an appropriate training set (i.e., lots of examples of images with labels), but there's no guarantee that it will work well on any particular problem.

I am trying to understand how this works in practice.
\end{blockquote}

It does not work in practice. This is a very simple model which was designed to illustrate the principles behind neural networks. In real life, we use much more complex models.

\section{Theory}

In general, neural networks learn functions from inputs to outputs. For instance, they could take an image as input and produce a label as output. Or they could take a sequence of words as input and produce another word as output.

Neural networks do not need to be told what the inputs represent. They only need to be given many pairs of inputs and correct outputs. Then, they try to find a function that maps each input to its corresponding output.

For instance, suppose we want our neural network to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. We would give it many pictures of cats and tell it that these are all cat pictures. Similarly, we would give it many pictures of dogs and tell it that these are dog pictures. After seeing enough such examples, the neural network should be able to correctly identify new pictures of cats and dogs.

This process is called supervised learning because the neural network learns from labeled data. There also exist other types of machine learning where the neural network is not provided with labels. These include unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.

\section{Practice}

In practice, neural networks are usually implemented using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. You don't need to write your own code to implement backpropagation. Instead, you feed your data into the library and let it handle everything else.

Here is an example of how you might use TensorFlow to build a neural network that recognizes handwritten digits: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification
