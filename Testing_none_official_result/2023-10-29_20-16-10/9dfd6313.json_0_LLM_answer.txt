Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first element is the number of elements in the array". The first line of your sample data has `5` as its first element, but there are only three elements in that array (i.e., it's a length-three array).

Answer: \section{[J](http://jsoftware.com/)}

\begin{code}
(+/)@.(>./.)&.>
\end{code}

Explanation:

\begin{code}
(+/)@.(>./.)&.>   Input: Array of integers
                    NB. >./. is an anonymous function which takes one argument and returns another function
                        which compares each element of the original array to the corresponding element of the argument
                        array using '>'
                    NB. &.> is an anonymous function which takes two arguments and applies the second argument to the first
                        argument
                    NB. (+/)@. is an anonymous function which takes one argument and adds all of its elements together
                        NB. This means we can apply this function to any list of lists and get back a single integer
                            representing the sum of all the elements in those sublists
\end{code}
