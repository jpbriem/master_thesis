Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two numbers are the number of rows and columns". The first line is a single integer (in this case `1`), which is the number of examples in your training set. Then each subsequent line has one or more integers separated by spaces; these are the inputs for that particular example. Finally there will be another line with just an integer on it, which is the number of test cases to follow. After that come the test cases, which have the same format as the training data except they don't end with a line containing only an integer.

Answer: You can use [`numpy.loadtxt`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/basics.io.html#loading-an-array) to load the file into memory. It supports reading from files with multiple lines.

For example, if we save your sample data to a file called `data.txt`, then we could read it like so:

\begin{code}
import numpy as np

with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = np.loadtxt(f)
print(data)
\end{code}

This would print out:

\begin{code}
[[  0   0   0]
 [  0   0   0]
 [  0   0   0]
 [  0   0   0]
 [  0   0   0]
 [  0   0   0]]
\end{code}
