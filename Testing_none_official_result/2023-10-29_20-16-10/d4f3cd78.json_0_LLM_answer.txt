Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error function. It might happen that a particular set of weights and biases will produce an acceptable result for your test data, but there are many other sets of weights and biases which would also do so. You need to be able to describe in mathematical terms exactly how you want the network to behave on all possible inputs (not just those in your training/testing data), then choose an appropriate loss function accordingly.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to create a neural network that can detect a specific pattern in a matrix.
\end{blockquote}

This is a very broad question, because there are lots of different kinds of patterns. For instance, if you wanted to find a diagonal line, or a horizontal line, or a vertical line, or a circle, or a square, etc., each one requires a different approach.

In general, though, you should start with a simple model, like a single-layer perceptron, and see whether you can get it to work at all. If you can't even make a simple model work, then you probably won't have much luck with more complicated models.
