Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two rows are the same". The first row is `0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0`, and the second row is `0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0`. They look different to me...

Answer: You can use [`itertools.tee`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee) to split an iterator into multiple iterators that all iterate over the same values in parallel. This allows you to process each line independently while still being able to compare them with each other.

For example:

\begin{code}
import itertools as it

with open('input.txt') as f:
    lines = [line for line in f]

for i, (a, b) in enumerate(it.tee(lines)):
    if a == b:
        print("The {}th line is repeated.".format(i))
\end{code}
