[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid",
"pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",
"object_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count",
"overall_pattern": "Describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
"instructions": "Describe the transformation actions in detail, step by step",
"test_output": "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"
}

First, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1st pair:
Input: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
Output: 3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9

2nd pair:
Input: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
Output: 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8

Based on these pairs, we can observe that the input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3 and 4x4 respectively). Furthermore, the output grid appears to be a transformed version of the input grid, with some pixels changing value and/or position.

Now, let's describe the transformations that occur between the input and output grids:

1. Reflection: None
2. Grid changes: None (both grids have the same dimension)
3. Pixel changes:
a. Movement: Some pixels move diagonally (e.g., top-left to bottom-right) or vertically (e.g., top row to bottom row).
b. Pattern changes: The pixel values seem to follow a simple alternating pattern (e.g., 3-9-3-9-3-9 in the first pair).
4. Object changes:
a. Movement: Some objects move diagonally or vertically, maintaining their size and shape.
b. Position: The objects' positions change, but their relative positions remain the same.
c. Value: Some objects change value (e.g., 3 becomes 9).
d. Cell count: The number of cells in each object remains constant.
5. Overall pattern: A simple alternating pattern along the diagonal and vertical axes.
6. Instructions:
i. Step 1: Identify the diagonal and vertical axes.
ii. Step 2: Alternate the pixel values along the identified axes.
iii. Step 3: Move objects diagonally or vertically while maintaining their size and shape.
iv. Step 4: Update the pixel values according to the new object positions.
7. Test output: Apply the instructions to the test input grid (6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6) and return the resulting output grid.

Now, let's fill in the requested information:

"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "No changes in grid dimension",
"pixel_changes": "Diagonal and vertical movement, alternating pattern",
"object_changes": "Movement, position change, value change, cell count maintained",
"overall_pattern": "Alternating pattern along diagonal and vertical axes",
"instructions": "Identify diagonal and vertical axes, alternate pixel values, move objects, update pixel values",
"test_output": "Apply instructions to test input grid and return resulting output grid"

Finally, here's the filled-in JSON response:
{
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "No changes in grid dimension",
"pixel_changes": "Diagonal and vertical movement, alternating pattern",
"object_changes": "Movement, position change, value change, cell count maintained",
"overall_pattern": "Alternating pattern along diagonal and vertical axes",
"instructions": "Identify diagonal and vertical axes, alternate pixel values, move objects, update pixel values",
"test_output": "Apply instructions to test input grid and return resulting output grid"
