[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  reflection: The input-output pairs exhibit a pattern of geometric transformations, specifically translations, rotations, and scaling. The grid dimensions remain the same.

grid_changes: None.

pixel_changes: Pixels move or change value according to a specific pattern.

object_changes: Objects undergo transformations such as movement, size change, rotation, and flipping. Their positions, values, and cell counts change accordingly.

overall_pattern: The input-output relationships suggest a general pattern of geometric transformations combined with pixel and object modifications.

instructions: To apply the transformation, follow these steps:

1. Translate the grid by (x, y) pixels, where (x, y) is a vector that varies across input-output pairs.
2. Rotate the grid counterclockwise by an angle α = 30° or α = 45°.
3. Scale the grid by a factor of s = 2 or s = 3, randomly choosing whether to scale up or down.
4. Flip the grid horizontally or vertically with a probability of p = 0.5.
5. Change the value of some pixels to create patterns or shapes. These patterns may involve counting, sorting, or creating symmetries.
6. Modify the objects by moving them, changing their size, rotating, or flipping them. Update their positions, values, and cell counts accordingly.
7. Return the transformed grid as output.

test_output: By applying the above instructions to the test input grid, we obtain the following output:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 3, 7, 3, 1, 0, 4, 4, 0
0, 3, 1, 7, 1, 3, 0, 4, 4, 0
