You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The given train input and output pairs share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background.

From the given examples, we can observe that the input-output relationship involves simple transformations such as flipping, sliding, and rotation. The transformations occur within a fixed region, without any change in the overall shape or size of the grid.

Therefore, the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs can be described as follows:

* Reflection: Reflect the input grid around the vertical axis (y = 0) to obtain the output grid.
* Grid Changes: The dimension of the input grid remains the same as the output grid.
* Pixel Changes: Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes. There are no pixel changes in this case since the reflection occurs around the vertical axis, which does not affect the pixel values.
* Object Changes: Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count. Since there are no objects in the given grids, there are no changes in the output.
* Overall Pattern: The overall pattern is a reflection of the input grid around the vertical axis (y = 0).
* Instructions: To transform the input grid, reflect it around the vertical axis (y = 0).
* Test Output: Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid.

Based on the above analysis, the instruction to transform the test input grid is:

Reflect the test input grid around the vertical axis (y = 0) to obtain the test output grid.
