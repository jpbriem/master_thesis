[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  reflection: The input-output pairs exhibit a pattern of moving objects and changing colors. The objects move diagonally, and their colors change accordingly. There are also instances of objects merging and splitting.

grid_changes: None. The dimension of the input grid remains the same throughout the examples.

pixel_changes: The pixel changes involve movements of objects, changes in color, and appearances of new objects.

object_changes: The objects undergo changes in movement, size, shape, position, value, cell count, and color. They can merge, split, or remain static.

overall_pattern: The simplest input-output relationship is a dynamic system where objects move and change color according to certain rules.

instructions: To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the grid with the input values.
2. Apply the following transformations to the grid:
a. Diagonal movement: shift rows and columns by one pixel diagonally.
b. Color change: switch the color of each pixel to its complementary color (i.e., 0 becomes 2, 2 becomes 0).
c. Merge and split: combine adjacent identical objects into a single object, or divide a single object into two or four smaller objects, depending on their size and position.
d. Random noise: set some pixels to a random value between 0 and 2.
3. Return the transformed grid as the output.

test_output: Here's the transformed test input grid using the instructions above:

0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0
2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0
2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this output differs from the original test output due to the additional transformations applied.
