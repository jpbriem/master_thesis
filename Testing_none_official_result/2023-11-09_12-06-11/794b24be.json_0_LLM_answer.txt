You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  {

"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid",
"pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",

The given train input-output pairs exhibit a pattern of translating the input grid by some cells in the x or y direction, scaling the grid up or down, and/or flipping the grid horizontally or vertically. Additionally, there might be noise pixels added or removed from the grid.

Based on the given examples, we can infer the following rules:

1. Reflection: The output grid is a reflection of the input grid around the center axis, either horizontally, vertically, or both.
2. Grid Changes: The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid, either by scaling up or down or by flipping the grid.
3. Pixel Changes: The output pixels are a function of the input pixels, possibly moving or changing pattern.
4. Object Changes: The output objects are a function of the input objects, possibly moving, changing size, shape, position, value, or cell count.
5. Overall Pattern: The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is a combination of reflection, grid changes, pixel changes, object changes, and noise addition/removal.
6. Instructions: To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:

a. Reflect the input grid around the center axis, either horizontally, vertically, or both.
b. Scale the grid up or down by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
c. Flip the grid horizontally or vertically.
d. Add or remove noise pixels from the grid.
e. Move or change the pattern of the objects in the grid.
f. Change the size, shape, position, value, or cell count of the objects in the grid.
7. Test Output: Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid.

Therefore, the answer to the test input is:

{
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid",
"pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",
"object_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count",
"overall_pattern": "Describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
"instructions": "Describe the transformation actions in detail step by step",
"test_output": "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"
