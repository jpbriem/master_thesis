You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The given input-output pairs share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background.

Based on the given examples, we can observe that the transformation involves geometric and topological changes, such as line drawing, rectangle creation, symmetry, and rotation. The objects in the grid are transformed based on their surroundings, and noise pixels are added or removed.

The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is that the output is derived from the input by applying a sequence of transformation rules. These rules include:

1. Reflecting the input grid around the diagonal or horizontal axis.
2. Changing the dimension of the input grid while maintaining the aspect ratio.
3. Moving objects in the grid to new positions while preserving their original shape and size.
4. Rotating objects in the grid by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.
5. Mirroring objects in the grid along the vertical or horizontal axis.
6. Scaling objects in the grid up or down while maintaining their original shape.
7. Adding or removing noise pixels from the grid.
8. Creating rectangles or lines in the grid based on the positions of objects.
9. Counting the number of objects in the grid and placing them in a specific location.
10. Sorting the objects in the grid based on their color or position.

To transform the test input grid, we need to apply these transformation rules in a specific order to obtain the desired output. The instructions for transforming the test input grid are as follows:

1. Reflect the input grid around the diagonal axis.
2. Change the dimension of the input grid to make it twice as large in both dimensions.
3. Move object 1 to position (3,1).
4. Rotate object 2 by 90 degrees clockwise.
5. Mirror object 3 along the horizontal axis.
6. Scale object 4 down by a factor of 2.
7. Add noise pixels to the grid.
8. Create a rectangle around objects 1 and 2.
9. Count the number of objects in the grid and place the result in the top-left corner.
10. Sort the objects in the grid based on their color.

After applying these instructions, the resulting output grid is:

3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

This output grid satisfies all the transformation rules mentioned above and is the expected output for the given test input grid.
