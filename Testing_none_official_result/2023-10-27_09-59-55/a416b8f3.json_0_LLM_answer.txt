The first line of the `train` file contains the number of samples in the training set (in this case, 4). Each subsequent line specifies a single sample in the format `(input features), (output value)`. The `input features` are separated by spaces and may include numerical values or categorical variables. The `output value` is also a numerical value.

In the `example` section, we provide three examples of training inputs and their corresponding outputs. These examples demonstrate how to use the `train` function to generate synthetic data for a simple classification problem.

Note that the `train` function assumes that the input features are continuous and follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. If your input features have different distributions, you will need to modify the `train` function accordingly.
