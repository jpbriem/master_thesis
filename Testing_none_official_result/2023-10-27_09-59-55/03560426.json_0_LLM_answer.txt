As you can see, the training and test inputs are all zeroes, but the training output is different from the test output. This means that the neural network has learned something during training, even though there is no data in the training set.

In general, it's a good idea to have some data in the training set, so that the neural network can learn from it. However, if you don't have any data available, you can still use the `train()` function to train the neural network on random or artificial data. Just be aware that the neural network may not perform well on real-world data if it hasn't been trained on anything resembling that data.
