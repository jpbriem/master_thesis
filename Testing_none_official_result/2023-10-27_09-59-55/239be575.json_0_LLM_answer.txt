LLM answer:

8
End of example.
Note that the last two examples are not correct because they do not match the expected output given by the training data. This is a common problem in machine learning, known as overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and fails to generalize well to new inputs. To address this issue, you can try different techniques such as regularization or early stopping.
