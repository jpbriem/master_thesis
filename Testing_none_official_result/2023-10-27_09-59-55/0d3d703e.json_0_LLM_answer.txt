The first column of the `train` dataset contains the inputs (numbers), and the second column contains the corresponding outputs (also numbers). The goal is to use machine learning algorithms to learn a mapping between the inputs and outputs, so that when new inputs are given, the algorithm can predict the correct outputs. In this case, the algorithm has learned that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is non-linear, as shown by the different outputs for each set of inputs.
