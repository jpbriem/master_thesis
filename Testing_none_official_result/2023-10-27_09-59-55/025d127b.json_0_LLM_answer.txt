As you can see, the training data consists of a sequence of 10 inputs (0's and 1's) followed by a sequence of 10 outputs (also 0's and 1's). The goal is to train the network to predict the correct output for a given input. In this case, the network is trying to learn how to recognize the handwritten digit "8".
The test data is similar to the training data, but it is not used during training. Instead, we use it to evaluate the performance of the trained network. As you can see, the test output is also a sequence of 10 digits, and the goal is to compare it with the expected output (which is also a sequence of 10 digits).
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
