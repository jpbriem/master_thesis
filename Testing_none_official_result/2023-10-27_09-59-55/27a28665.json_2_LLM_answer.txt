The first column is the number of inputs (or features) in each sample, and the second column is the target or response variable for each sample. The training examples are labeled with a single digit, while the test examples are labeled with a different digit.

To use this dataset to train an MLP, you would need to preprocess the data by scaling the input variables to have zero mean and unit variance, and then splitting the data into training and validation sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. You can then use the `MLPClassifier` class from scikit-learn to train an MLP on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the validation set using metrics such as accuracy or F1 score.
