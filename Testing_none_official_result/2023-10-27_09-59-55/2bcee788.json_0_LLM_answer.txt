As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors (i.e., they only contain values of 0 or 1), and the outputs are also binary vectors indicating whether each element in the input vector is a member of the class (in this case, either "dog" or "cat").

The first few examples in both the training and test sets are trivially easy to classify, as there are no dogs or cats in the input vectors. However, as you go through more examples, the patterns become more complex and it becomes harder to correctly classify the inputs. For instance, in the second row of the training set, the input vector contains two ones and one zero, which could correspond to either a dog or a cat. Similarly, in the third row of the test set, the input vector contains three ones and two zeros, which could correspond to either a dog or a cat.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
