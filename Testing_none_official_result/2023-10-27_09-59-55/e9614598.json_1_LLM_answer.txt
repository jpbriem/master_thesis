As you can see, the training data consists of a sequence of binary inputs (0 or 1), and the corresponding outputs are also binary values (0 or 1). The goal of the neural network is to learn the relationship between these inputs and outputs in order to make predictions on new, unseen data. In this case, the neural network has learned that the input "0, 0, 0, 0, 0" corresponds to an output of "0", and the input "0, 0, 0, 0, 1" corresponds to an output of "1".

The test data consists of a single input ("0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0") which the neural network has not seen before, and it predicts the correct output of "1".

It's important to note that this is just a simple example, in real-world scenarios the datasets will be much larger and more complex, and the neural networks will have many more layers and neurons.
