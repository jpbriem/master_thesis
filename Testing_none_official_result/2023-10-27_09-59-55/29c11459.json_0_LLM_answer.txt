End of example.
\end{code}

As you can see, the training data consists of a sequence of 0s and 1s, where each sequence is terminated by a special symbol (either `#` or `?`). The test data also consists of a sequence of 0s and 1s, but it does not have any special symbols at the end.

The neural network was trained on the training data using the `train()` function from Keras, with the `epochs=10` parameter set to specify how many times the training data should be fed through the network during training. After training, the network was evaluated on the test data using the `evaluate()` function from Keras, which returns the accuracy of the network on the test data.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
