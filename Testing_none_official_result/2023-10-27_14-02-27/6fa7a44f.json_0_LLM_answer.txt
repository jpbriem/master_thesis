The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set (in this case, 3). Each subsequent line specifies a single example, with each number representing a feature value for that example. For example, in the first example, the values `9`, `1`, and `4` represent the values of the features for the first example. The corresponding output values are also given on the next line.

In the `test` file, there is only one example given per line, just like in the `train` file. However, these are not used for training but rather for testing the model's performance.
