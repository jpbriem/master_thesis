As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors (i.e., they only contain values of 0 or 1). The training output is also binary, but it contains some non-zero values in the last row. This means that the neural network has learned to recognize certain patterns in the data, and it's able to predict the correct output for new inputs.

To use this trained model to make predictions on new data, you would simply feed the new data into the model as input, and then read out the predicted output from the model. For example, if you wanted to predict the output of a new binary vector with the first four elements being 0, 0, 0, and 1, you could feed that vector into the model as input, and then read out the predicted output from the model.
