The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set (in this case, 4). Each subsequent line specifies a single example in the format `(input features) -> (output)`. The `input features` are separated by spaces and are represented as integers. The `output` is also represented as integers and is given on the same line.

For example, in the first example, the input features are `6`, `5`, `5`, which correspond to the values in the `train input` section above. The output is `6, 6, 5, 5, 5`, which corresponds to the values in the `train output` section above.

Similarly, in the second example, the input features are `1`, `3`, `5`, which correspond to the values in the `train input` section above. The output is `1, 1, 3, 5, 5`, which corresponds to the values in the `train output` section above.

In general, each example in the `train` file should consist of a list of input features followed by a single output value.
