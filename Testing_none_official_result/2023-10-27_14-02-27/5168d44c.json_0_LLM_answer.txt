As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors (i.e., they only contain values of 0 or 1), but the outputs are not necessarily binary. In fact, in this case, the outputs are often a mix of 0s and 1s, with some examples having more than one 1. This is because the neural network is learning to recognize patterns in the data that involve multiple features, rather than just relying on a single feature to make predictions.

To summarize, the main difference between training and testing in machine learning is that training involves using a dataset to learn the parameters of a model, while testing involves evaluating how well the trained model performs on new, unseen data. The goal of training is to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the true outputs, while the goal of testing is to estimate the generalization performance of the model on new data.
