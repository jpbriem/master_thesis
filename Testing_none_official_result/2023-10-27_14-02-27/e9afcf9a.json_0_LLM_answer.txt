2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6
End of example.
```
As you can see, the training data consists of a sequence of numbers, and the model is trained to predict the next number in the sequence based on the previous numbers. The test data also consists of a sequence of numbers, and the model's predictions are compared to the actual values. In this case, the model is able to accurately predict the next number in both the training and test sequences.
