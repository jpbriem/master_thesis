As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors with length 8, representing images of size $3\times3$. The training output is also a binary vector, but it has been modified to produce an error rate of 0.5 when compared to the true labels. This means that the model will have difficulty correctly classifying the images in the training set, and will likely overfit to some extent.
To use this dataset for training a convolutional neural network, you would need to preprocess the images by resizing them to a fixed size (e.g., $32\times32$ or $64\times64$), normalizing the pixel values to be between 0 and 1, and possibly applying data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and adding noise to the images. You could then split the dataset into a training set and a validation set, and use the training set to train your CNN using stochastic gradient descent or another optimization algorithm. After training, you could evaluate the performance of your model on the validation set and adjust the hyperparameters as needed to improve its accuracy.
