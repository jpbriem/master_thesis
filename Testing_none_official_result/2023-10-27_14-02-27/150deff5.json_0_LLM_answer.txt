As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same output. This is because the neural network has learned to recognize the patterns in the data, and it's able to generalize well to new examples that it hasn't seen before.

In this example, the neural network was trained on a set of 16 input-output pairs, and it was able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs. The network consists of two layers with 3 neurons in each layer, and it uses a simple linear activation function. The learning rate was set to 0.1, and the network was trained for 100 epochs.

You can try changing the number of neurons in each layer, the learning rate, or the number of epochs to see how these parameters affect the performance of the network. You can also try adding more input-output pairs to the training set to improve the accuracy of the network.
