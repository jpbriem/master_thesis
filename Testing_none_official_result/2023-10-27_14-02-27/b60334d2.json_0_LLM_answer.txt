As you can see, the training data consists of a sequence of 8 binary values (0 or 1), and the test data also consists of a sequence of 8 binary values. The model is trained to predict the next value in the sequence based on the previous 7 values. In this case, the model has learned that the next value is often the opposite of the previous value (i.e., if the previous value was 0, the next value is likely to be 1, and vice versa).

To use this model for time series forecasting, we would need to feed it with a sequence of past observations from the time series, and then use the predicted values as the forecasted values for the next time step. For example, if we have a sequence of 8 past observations, the model would predict the next 8 values in the sequence, and these predictions would be used as the forecasted values for the next time step. We could then repeat this process for each time step in the future, using the model's predictions as the forecasted values for each step.
