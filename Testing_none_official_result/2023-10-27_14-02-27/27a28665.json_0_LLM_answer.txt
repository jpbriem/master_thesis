The first column is the number of inputs (or features) in the training data, and the second column is the number of outputs (or labels) in the training data. The third column shows the actual values of the outputs for each training example, and the fourth column shows the predicted values of the outputs based on the trained model.

In this case, we can see that the model has been trained on a dataset with 10 examples, where each example consists of 3 inputs (or features) and 1 output (or label). The model has correctly predicted the output value for all 10 examples.

To evaluate the performance of the model further, we can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics measure different aspects of the model's performance, such as how well it is able to predict the correct output value, how confident it is in its predictions, etc.
