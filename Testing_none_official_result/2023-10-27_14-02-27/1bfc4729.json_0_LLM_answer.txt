As you can see, the training data consists of a sequence of 0s and 1s, where each sequence is terminated by an end-of-sequence marker (in this case, `0`). The model is trained on these sequences to predict the next digit in the sequence given the previous digits.

The test data also consists of a sequence of 0s and 1s, but it does not have any end-of-sequence markers. Instead, the last element in the sequence is set to `8`, which indicates that the sequence should be treated as a single "digit" for the purposes of prediction.

To use the model to make predictions on new data, you would feed it a sequence of 0s and 1s, and then ask it to predict the next digit in the sequence based on the patterns learned during training.
