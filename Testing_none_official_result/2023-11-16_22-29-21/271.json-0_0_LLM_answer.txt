LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[c, c, a, c], [a, c, a, a], [a, a, c, a], [c, a, a, a], [a, a, c, c]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a number of different size shapes.
To make the output, you have to  copy the input grid. Any shapes which only contain one single square should be colored blue.
The output grid size  is the same as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[c, c, b, c], [b, c, b, b], [b, b, c, b], [c, b, b, b], [b, b, c, c]]

Example 2:
Input:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]
Description:
In the input, you should see  a number of different size shapes.
To make the output, you have to  copy the input grid. Any shapes which only contain one single square should be colored blue.
The output grid size  is the same as the input grid.

Output:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]

Constraints:
1 <= rows, columns <= 50
rows * columns <= 10^4
User Input Format:
Input Grid
Description

Sample Output:
{
    "input_grid": "[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]",
    "instructions": "In the input, you should see  a number of different size shapes.\nTo make the output, you have to  copy the input grid. Any shapes which only contain one single square should be colored blue.\nThe output grid size  is the same as the input grid.",
    "output_dimension": "2x3",
    "test_output": "[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]"
}

Explanation:
The input grid has two rows and three columns. It contains two shapes, one shape with two squares and another shape with one square. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. All the squares that form a single shape are colored blue.

Solution:
[[c, c, a, b], [a, c, a, a], [a, a, b, a], [b, a, a, a], [a, a, c, c]]
