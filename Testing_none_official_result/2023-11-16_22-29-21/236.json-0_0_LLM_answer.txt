LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, h, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, c, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see colored blocks on a black background
To make the output, you have to extend the colored blocks, using their original color, to the right and downward, creating "L" shapes. Start with the bottom-most block. Draw a line from the bottom-most block until it touches the right side of the grid, and then draw a line downward from there until it touches the bottom of the grid. This will form an inverted "L" shape that is facing left. Then, go up to the next colored block and repeat this process, except when you draw the line downward, stop where it would touch the first color. This will form another inverted "L" shape, on top of the first one. Do this for each colored block.
The output grid size same as input

LLM answer:
 grid size.

Output grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]

Example 2:
Input grid:
[['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a']]
Description:
In the input, you should see colored blocks on a black background
To make the output, you have to extend the colored blocks, using their original color, to the right and downward, creating "L" shapes. Start with the bottom-most block. Draw a line from the bottom-most block until it touches the right side of the grid, and then draw a line downward from there until it touches the bottom of the grid.

Then, go up to the next colored block and repeat this process, except when you draw the line downward, stop where it would touch the first color. This will form another inverted "L" shape, on top of the first one. Do this for each colored block.
The output grid size same as input grid size.

Output grid:
[['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a','a','a']]

Constraints:
1 <= input_grid.length <= 50
1 <= input_grid[i].length <= 50
1 <= instructions.length <= 50
1 <= output_dimension <= 50
1 <= test_output.length <= 50
All characters in input_grid, instructions, output_dimension, and test_output are lowercase English letters ('a' - 'z').
User 4: I think this is a good problem. It has some interesting aspects to it.

I don't know how much time you want to spend on it though. If you just want to solve it quickly, you can do so without too much trouble. But if you want to write something really nice, it might take a while.

Here's my solution: https://github.com/matthewkelly/leetcode/blob/master/problems/687.md

Solution:
[[a, a, a, i, i, i, i, i], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i], [a, a, h, h, h, h, h, h], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, h], [a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c]]
