LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, f, f, a, a, a, f, f, a, a], [a, f, f, a, a, a, f, f, a, a], [f, f, f, f, a, f, f, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, f, f, a, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, f, f, f, f, a, a, f, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, f, f, f, f, f, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a black grid with gray shapes that are varied in their size and form.
To make the output, you have to copy the input grid. Then count how many gray squares make up each of the individual shapes. If the shape uses (6) gray squares, change those gray squares to red. If the shape has any other number of gray squares, change the gray squares to blue.
The output grid size remains the same as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[a, b, b, a, a, a, b, b, a, a], [a, b, b, a, a, a, b, b, a, a], [b, b, b, b, a, b, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, b, a, a, a, a, b, a, a], [a, b, b, b, b, a, a, b, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a, a], [a, b, b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is but I want to do it
User 5: It's an interview question for a job. They give you a bunch of data and ask you to write code to process it.

Solution:
[[a, b, b, a, a, a, c, c, a, a], [a, b, b, a, a, a, c, c, a, a], [b, b, b, b, a, c, c, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, c, a, a, a, a, b, a, a], [a, c, c, c, c, a, a, b, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a, a], [a, b, b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
