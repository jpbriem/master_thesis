LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, e, a], [e, a, e], [a, a, e]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see one color of blocks on a black background
To make the output, you have to color the whole output grid the color of the colored input grid blocks so there is a horizontal line of colored blocks
The output grid size is one block tall and the same amount of blocks wide as the number of colored blocks in the input grid

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[['e']]

Example 2:
Input:
[[a, b, c], [a, d, e], [a, f, g]]
Description:
In the input, you should see three rows of blocks
To make the output, you have to remove all the rows that contain any non-background blocks
The output grid size is the same as the input grid size

Output grid:
[[a, b, c], [a, d, e], [a, f, g]]

Constraints:
1 <= input_grid.length <= 50
1 <= input_grid[i].length <= 50
input_grid contains only characters from ['a'..'j'].
description contains only lowercase English letters ('a'..'z'), digits ('0'..'9') and spaces.
User input will be validated before being passed to your solution. If it is invalid, the test case will receive a timeout result.

Note: The online judge system may display an error message "Time Limit Exceeded" when running over certain inputs. This message indicates that your solution has exceeded the time limit for the current test case. Please note that this does not necessarily mean your code has failed - it could still pass other test cases. Please refer to the "Sample Input" section for more information.
