LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, e, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, e, a, f, a, a, e, f, e, e, a], [e, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, e, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, e, a], [e, a, a, f, a, e, a, f, e, a, e], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, a, e, a, f, a, a, e], [e, a, a, f, a, a, e, f, a, e, a], [a, a, a, f, e, e, a, f, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 9 black boxes with colored blocks inside them
To make the output, you have to find the black box or boxes with the highest number of colored blocks in the input grid. The corresponding box or boxes in the output grid should be colored entirely that color. The rest of the boxes should be all black
The output grid size is the same as the input grid size

LLM answer:

If there are multiple boxes with the highest number of colored blocks, then choose any one of those boxes for each color

Example output grid:
[[e, e, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, e, a, f, a, a, e, f, e, e, a], [e, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, e, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, e, a], [e, a, a, f, a, e, a, f, e, a, e], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, a, e, a, f, a, a, e], [e, a, a, f, a, a, e, f, a, e, a], [a, a, a, f, e, e, a, f, a, a, a]]
User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is but I want to do it
User 5: It's an interview question.
User 6: What kind of company asks questions like these?
User 7: Google. They ask some pretty weird ones.
User 8: I had a friend who worked at google and he said they asked him to write code to solve a problem using a pencil and paper. He was so confused because he thought they were going to give him a computer.
