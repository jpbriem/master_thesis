LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[j, g, c, j, j, c, g, j], [c, j, j, g, g, j, j, c], [g, j, j, c, c, j, j, g], [j, c, g, j, j, g, c, j]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see patterns in a large area
To make the output, you have to take the pattern on the top left and put it in the 2x2 grid
The output grid size will be 2x2

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[['j', 'g'], ['c', 'j']]

Example 2:
Input:
[[j, g, c, j, j, c, g, j], [c, j, j, g, g, j, j, c], [g, j, j, c, c, j, j, g], [j, c, g, j, j, g, c, j]]
Description:
In the input, you should see patterns in a large area
To make the output, you have to take the pattern on the top left and put it in the 2x2 grid
The output grid size will be 2x2

Output:
[['j', 'g'], ['c', 'j']]

Constraints:
1 <= rows, columns <= 50
rows * columns <= 10^4
All characters are lowercase English letters ('a' - 'j').
There exists exactly one character that appears more than once in the input grid.
