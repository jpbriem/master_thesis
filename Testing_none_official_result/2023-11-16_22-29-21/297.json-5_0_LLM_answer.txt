LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[j, j, j, j, j, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, j, j, j, j, j]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 3 grids of different colors and size
To make the output, you have to change the color of the 6x6 grid to the 2x2 color, the 4x4 change to the 6x6 color and the 2x2 color to the 4x4 color
The output grid size the same as the input

LLM answer:
 grid size

Output grid:
[[j, j, j, j, j, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, j, j, j, j, j]]

Example 2:
Input grid:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]
Description:
In the input, you should see 2 grids of different colors and size
To make the output, you have to change the color of the 2x2 grid to the 2x2 color and the 2x2 color to the 2x2 color
The output grid size the same as the input grid size

Output grid:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]
