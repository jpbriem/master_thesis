LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, i, j, j, g, g, f, b, b, f, g, g, j, j, i, e], [i, g, j, j, g, h, b, f, f, b, h, g, j, j, g, i], [j, j, f, c, f, b, f, f, f, f, b, f, c, f, j, j], [j, j, c, c, b, f, f, j, j, f, f, b, c, c, j, j], [g, g, f, b, b, e, f, c, c, f, e, b, b, f, g, g], [g, a, a, a, e, e, c, h, h, c, e, e, f, b, h, g], [f, a, a, a, f, c, j, f, f, j, c, f, f, f, b, f], [b, a, a, a, c, h, f, j, j, f, h, c, j, f, f, b], [b, f, f, j, c, h, f, j, j, f, h, c, j, f, f, b], [f, b, f, f, f, c, j, f, f, j, c, f, f, f, b, f], [g, h, b, f, e, e, c, h, h, c, e, e, f, b, h, g], [g, g, f, b, b, e, f, c, c, f, e, b, b, f, g, g], [j, j, c, c, b, f, f, j, j, f, f, b, c, c, j, j], [j, j, f, c, f, b, f, f, f, f, b, f, c, f, j, j], [i, g, j, j, g, h, b, f, f, b, h, g, j, j, g, i], [e, i, j, j, g, g, f, b, b, f, g, g, j, j, i, e]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see can see a pattern with a some black part.
To make the output, you have to fill the black spots with the exact same pattern that need to be filled in the original grid.
The output grid size should be the same size as the black spots

LLM answer:
 in the input grid.

Output grid:
[[e, i, j, j, g, g, f, b, b, f, g, g, j, j, i, e], [i, g, j, j, g, h, b, f, f, b, h, g, j, j, g, i], [j, j, f, c, f, b, f, f, f, f, b, f, c, f, j, j], [j, j, c, c, b, f, f, j, j, f, f, b, c, c, j, j], [g, g, f, b, b, e, f, c, c, f, e, b, b, f, g, g], [g, a, a, a, e, e, c, h, h, c, e, e, f, b, h, g], [f, a, a, a, f, c, j, f, f, j, c, f, f, f, b, f], [b, a, a, a, c, h, f, j, j, f, h, c, j, f, f, b], [b, f, f, j, c, h, f, j, j, f, h, c, j, f, f, b], [f, b, f, f, f, c, j, f, f, j, c, f, f, f, b, f], [g, h, b, f, e, e, c, h, h, c, e, e, f, b, h, g], [g, g, f, b, b, e, f, c, c, f, e, b, b, f, g, g], [j, j, c, c, b, f, f, j, j, f, f, b, c, c, j, j], [j, j, f, c, f, b, f, f, f, f, b, f, c, f, j, j], [i, g, j, j, g, h, b, f, f, b, h, g, j, j, g, i], [e, i, j, j, g, g, f, b, b, f, g, g, j, j, i, e]]
User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is but I want one
User 5: It's an interview question for a software engineer role.
User 6: That's insane. I would never hire someone who could do this.
User 7: Why? This is exactly the kind of problem solving skills they look for.
User 6: Because it's completely unrelated to anything we actually work on. We don't write JSON parsers, we don't write image processing algorithms, we don't write any code like this.

I'm sure there are people out there who can solve these problems quickly, but I wouldn't trust them to write production code.
