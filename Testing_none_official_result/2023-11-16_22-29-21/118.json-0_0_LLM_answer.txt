LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see two to three red bars on either the top, bottom, left or right side and two to three light blue squares.
To make the output, you have to you have to continue the direction the light blue squares are going until it reaches whatever the red spot it touches. Then it bounces off that spot and goes in that direction. Think of Pong. The line will always be diagonal, reach an edge of the grid and green except for the starting two or three spaces that are light blue.
The output grid size is the same.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
