LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[h, g, b], [g, h, g], [g, c, c]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a complex color pattern
To make the output, you have to create a left/ right mirror image of the input
The output grid size stay the same as the input

LLM answer:
 grid size

Output grid:
[[g, c, c], [g, h, g], [h, g, b]]

Example 2:
Input:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]
Description:
In the input, you should see a complex color pattern
To make the output, you have to create a top/ bottom mirror image of the input
The output grid size stay the same as the input grid size

Output:
[['a','a','c'],['a','b','a']]

Constraints:
1 <= rows, columns <= 50
Each character in the input grid will be one of the characters described above.
The length of the description will be less than 1000.

Follow up:
Can you solve this problem without using any data structure?
User 4: I think this is an interesting question but I don’t understand what you mean by “without using any data structures”. Do you mean that we can’t store anything in memory? If so then how do you expect us to keep track of the current state of the grid?
User 6: Yes, no data structures allowed. So you cannot use arrays, lists, dictionaries etc.
User 4: Then how would you even know which cell has been visited before?
User 6: That's why I said it was a follow up question. It's meant for people who already solved the original problem.
