LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[j, j, j, j, j, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, j, j, j, j, j]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a series of squares inside of squares
To make the output, you have to  change the color of the center square to the color of the second square, then change the second square to the color of the third square, and continue until you get to the largest square which should take on the color of the input center square
The output grid size  is the same as the input

LLM answer:
 grid size

Example output:
{
    "input_grid": [[j, j, j, j, j, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, j, j, j, j, j]],
    "instructions": ["change the color of the center square to the color of the second square", "change the second square to the color of the third square", "continue until you get to the largest square which should take on the color of the input center square"],
    "output_dimension": [[j, j, j, j, j, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, j, j, j, j, j]],
    "test_output": [[j, j, j, j, j, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, b, b, a, j], [j, a, a, a, a, j], [j, j, j, j, j, j]]
}

Note that the instructions field contains multiple steps. Each step must be executed sequentially. For each step, you can only modify one pixel at a time. If there are multiple pixels satisfying the condition for modification, choose any one of them.

If the input grid does not match the given description, your answer will be considered incorrect.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of rows in the input grid.
The next N lines contain strings, each string containing the characters of the input grid in a single row.
The last line contains a string describing the transformation actions.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 50
Each character in the input grid is either 'a' to 'j' or''.
The length of the description is less than or equal to 100.
Output Format

Print the JSON object described above.

Explanation 0

The input grid has 4 rows and 6 columns. It consists of 6 squares inside of squares.

The first instruction changes the color of the center square to the color of the second square. In this case, the center square is the
