LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a], [c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, a, a], [g, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [g, a, d, d, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, d, d, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, a, a], [a, a, a, g, a, g, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a 2x2 green square and a number of other smaller colored squares.
To make the output, you have to  copy the input grid. Then, connect the 2x2 green square to any and all other colored squares which you can reach with a straight line. Use the color of the square to which you are connecting the 2x2 green square. Fill in all of the black squares between that square and the 2x2 green square. Leave the rest of the grid - including any colored square you can't reach with a straight line - as they are.
The output grid size  is the same as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a], [c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, a, a], [g, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [g, a, d, d, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, d, d, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c, a, a], [a, a, a, g, a, g, a, a, a, a]]
User 4: I don’t know what this is but I want to do it now
User 5: It's a puzzle game called "Sokoban"
User 6: Sokoban was one of my favorite games when I was younger. I remember playing it on an old Macintosh computer.
