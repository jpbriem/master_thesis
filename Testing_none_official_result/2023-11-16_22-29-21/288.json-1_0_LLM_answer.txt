LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, b, a], [a, i, h], [j, j, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see colored block patterns
To make the output, you have to double the block patterns 2 times the grid size
The output grid size either 6x6 or 12x12

LLM answer:
 depending on the input grid size
If the input grid has an odd number of rows/columns, add one more row/column of black blocks to the right/bottom respectively
If the input grid has an even number of rows/columns, add two more rows/columns of black blocks to the right/bottom respectively
The output grid will be filled with the same pattern as the input grid but doubled
Example:
Input Grid: [[a, b, a], [a, i, h], [j, j, a]]
Output Grid: [[a, b, a, b, a, b], [a, i, h, i, h, i], [j, j, a, j, j, a], [j, j, a, j, j, a], [j, j, a, j, j, a], [j, j, a, j, j, a]]

Note that the output grid may contain duplicate elements.
