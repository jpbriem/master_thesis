LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, c, a, f, a, d, a, f, a, e, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, b, a, f, a, b, a, f, a, d, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 33x3 squares with gray lines between them
To make the output, you have to replace all 3x3 squares with a specific color. The color to replace is below:Green to Light BlueBlue to PurpleYellow to Dark RedRed to Orange
The output grid size is the same size as the input grid

LLM answer:
.

Output grid:
[[a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, c, a, f, a, d, a, f, a, e, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, b, a, f, a, b, a, f, a, d, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a]]
User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is but I want to do it
User 5: It's an interview question for a software engineer role.
User 6: That's why I said I didn't know what it was.
User 5: Sorry, I thought you were asking about the problem itself.
