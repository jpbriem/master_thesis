LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, b], [b, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 3x3 grid with some squares filled with the same color and the rest filled with black
To make the output, you have to mirror the grid on the new grid
The output grid size double the height of the input grid and the same width as the input grid

LLM answer:

The output grid has to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise

Output grid:
[['b', 'b', 'b'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a']]

Example 2:
Input grid:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, b], [b, a, a]]
Description:
In the input, you should see 3x3 grid with some squares filled with the same color and the rest filled with black
To make the output, you have to mirror the grid on the new grid
The output grid size double the height of the input grid and the same width as the input grid
The output grid has to be rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise

Output grid:
[['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'b'], ['b', 'a', 'a']]

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 50
n = m
1 <= k <= 6
k = l
All characters in the input grid will be one of the following: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'.
User 4: I think this is an interesting problem but I don’t understand what the “description” part means. Can someone explain?
User 1: It's basically a list of instructions that tell you how to transform the input grid into the output grid. For example, the first instruction might be "mirror the grid", which would mean flipping the input grid horizontally. Then the second instruction might be "rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise", which would mean rotating the mirrored grid 90 degrees clockwise. And so on.

Solution:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, b], [b, a, a], [b, a, a], [a, a, b], [a, a, a]]
