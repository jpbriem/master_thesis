LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, f, a, a, a, f, a, f, a], [a, f, a, a, a, f, a, f, a], [a, f, a, f, a, f, a, f, a], [a, f, a, f, a, f, a, f, a], [a, f, a, f, a, f, a, f, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a few bars that are gray
To make the output, you have to change the color of the tallest to blue, then second talest to red,third tallest to green,then finally shortest to yellow for both pairs.
The output grid size does not change

.

Output grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, d, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, d, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, d, a, e, a], [a, c, a, a, a, d, a, e, a], [a, c, a, e, a, d, a, e, a], [a, c, a, e, a, d, a, e, a], [a, c, a, e, a, d, a, e, a]]
User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is but I want to do it
User 5: It's an interview question.
User 6: What kind of company asks questions like these?
User 7: Google. They ask some pretty weird ones.
User 8: I had one about how many golf balls would fit inside a school bus.
User 9: That was a good one!
User 8: Yeah, I thought so too. I didn't get the job though.
User 9: Oh no :(
User 8: Nah, they said my answers were great, but I wasn't a good cultural fit.
User 9: Ahhh okay. Well, I hope you find something better suited for you :)
