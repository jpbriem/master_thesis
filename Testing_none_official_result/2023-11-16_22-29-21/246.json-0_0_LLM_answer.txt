LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a], [a, a, f, a, a, a, a, b, b, b], [a, f, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, j, j, a, a, a], [i, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [i, a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a], [i, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  colored shapes against a black background
To make the output, you have to  identify the largest shapes by number of squares. This may be one shape or more than one shape, if they have the same number of square. Then create a vertical line for each of those shapes, in the order from left to right of the shapes, each line with the same number of squares as the input shape. If only one shape is largest, there will be one output line. If two shapes are largest together, there will be two lines, and so on.
The output grid size  will be the size that the output lines require.

LLM answer:


Example:
Input grid: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a], [a, a, f, a, a, a, a, b, b, b], [a, f, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, j, j, a, a, a], [i, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [i, a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a], [i, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Output grid: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
