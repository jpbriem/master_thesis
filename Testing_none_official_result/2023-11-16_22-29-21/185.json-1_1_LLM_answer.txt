LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, b, a], [a, b, b], [b, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a 3x3 grid with between 1 to 4 blue squares in it.
To make the output, you have to count the number of blue squares in the input. You will need this same number of squares in the output, but the new squares will become red and will be relocated in the following order until you have used the same number of squares that you counted; First red square goes in top left; second red square (if any) goes if top middle; third red square (if any) goes in top right and fourth red square (if any) goes in middle of grid.
The output grid size is the same size as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Expected output:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'r', 'b'], ['b', 'a', 'a']]

Note:
If there are no blue squares in the input, then the output should contain no red squares.
If there are more than four blue squares in the input, then the output should contain exactly four red squares.
If there are less than four blue squares in the input, then the output should contain fewer red squares than blue squares in the input.

Input Description:
The input description consists of two parts:

A list of instructions describing how to transform the input grid into the output grid. Each instruction has one of the following forms:

"Move <color> from <position> to <newPosition>" - Move all squares of the specified color from their current positions to the specified new position. If multiple squares of the specified color exist at the specified position, they can be moved to the new position simultaneously.

"Rotate <direction> <numberOfTimes>" - Rotate the entire grid clockwise or counterclockwise by the specified number of times. The direction can be either "CW" for clockwise rotation or "CCW" for counterclockwise rotation.

"Flip <axis>" - Flip the entire grid along the specified axis. The axis can be either "X" for horizontal flip or "Y" for vertical flip.

An optional final instruction "Output Grid Dimensions" which specifies the dimensions of the output grid. This instruction is optional and may not always be present.

Example Input Descriptions:

Instruction 1:

"Move b from (1,0) to (2,1)"

This instruction moves all blue squares from position (1,0) to position (2,1).

Instruction 2:

"Rotate CW 1"

This instruction rotates the entire grid clockwise once.

Instruction 3:

"Flip Y"

This instruction flips the entire grid vertically.

Optional Final Instruction:

"Output Grid Dimensions: 5x6"

This instruction specifies that the output grid should have dimensions 5x6.
