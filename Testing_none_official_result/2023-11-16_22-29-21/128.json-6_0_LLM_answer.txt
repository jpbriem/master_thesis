LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[i, i, g], [e, g, j], [i, d, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a 3x3 grid with five different colors in the squares.
To make the output, you have to determine which color is used for the majority of the squares in the input grid, then use that color for the entire output grid.
The output grid size is the same.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[i, i, g], [e, g, j], [i, d, a]]

Example 2:
Input:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]
Description:
In the input, you should see a 2x3 grid with three different colors in the squares.
To make the output, you have to determine which color is used for the majority of the squares in the input grid, then use that color for the entire output grid.
The output grid size is the same.

Output:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]

Constraints:
1 <= rows <= 50
1 <= columns <= 50
1 <= colors <= 9
User Input Format:
First line contains the number of rows n.
Second line contains the number of columns m.
Third line contains the description.
Next n lines contain the input grid.

Sample Output:
{
    "input_grid": [[["a", "b", "a"], ["a", "a", "c"]]],
    "instructions": "In the input, you should see a 2x3 grid with three different colors in the squares.\nTo make the output, you have to determine which color is used for the majority of the squares in the input grid, then use that color for the entire output grid.\nThe output grid size is the same.",
    "output_dimension": "2x3",
    "test_output": [[["a", "b", "a"], ["a", "a", "c"]]]
}

Explanation:
The input grid has two rows and three columns. There are three different colors in the squares. To make the output, we have to determine which color is used for the majority of the squares in the input grid, then use that color for the entire output grid. The output grid size is the same.
