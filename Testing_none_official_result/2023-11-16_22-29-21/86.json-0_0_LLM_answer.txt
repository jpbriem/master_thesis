LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[g, e, e], [g, g, e], [e, g, h]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a grid of colored pixels.
To make the output, you have to   Create the same pattern as the input, just rotated 180 degrees.  Done.
The output grid size  is the same as the input.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[h, h, g], [e, g, g], [e, e, e]]

Example 2:
Input:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]
Description:
In the input, you should see  a grid of colored pixels.
To make the output, you have to   Replace all black pixels with blue ones.  Done.
The output grid size  is the same as the input.

Output:
[['b','b','b'],['b','b','c']]

Constraints:
1 <= rows, columns <= 50
rows * columns <= 10^4
All characters will be lowercase letters ('a' - 'j')
User Input Format:
First line contains two integers n and m denoting the number of rows and columns respectively.
Next n lines contain m characters each denoting the input grid.
Second line contains a string describing the instructions for the transformation.

Sample Output:
{
    "input_grid": [[g, e, e], [g, g, e], [e, g, h]],
    "instructions": "Create the same pattern as the input, just rotated 180 degrees.",
    "output_dimension": "[3, 3]",
    "test_output": [[h, h, g], [e, g, g], [e, e, e]]
}

Explanation:
We can see that the input grid has three rows and three columns. It also has a description which tells us how to transform the input grid. We need to create the same pattern as the input but rotate it 180 degrees. So we get the output grid as shown above.

Solution:
[[h, g, e], [e, g, g], [e, e, g]]
