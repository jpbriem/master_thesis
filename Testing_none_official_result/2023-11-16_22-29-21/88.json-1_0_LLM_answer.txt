LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, b, a, a, d, a, a, a, c, a, a, a], [a, b, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, i, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d, i, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a few red and green pixels. One green pixel and one red pixel will have other color pixels around them.
To make the output, you have to copy the placement and color of the pixels surrounding the red or green pixels that are not alone to the pixels that are alone. If the pixel is green the placement and color of the surrounding pixels should be the same as the surrounded green pixel. This should be applied to all solo green pixels. The same should be done with the red pixels, but the placement of the surrounding pixels should be mirrored horizontally.
The output grid size the same size as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, b, a, a, d, a, a, a, c, a, a, a], [a, b, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, i, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d, i, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is supposed to mean. Can someone explain?
User 5: It means they want you to write code for them.
User 6: No, it doesn't. They want you to solve a problem using their own language.
User 5: > Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:

This is literally asking for code.
User 6: That's just an explanation of how to do it. There's no actual code there.
