LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, c, d, e, f, g, h, a, a, a, d, e, f, g, h, i], [c, d, e, f, g, h, i, a, a, a, e, f, g, h, i, b], [d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c], [e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d], [f, g, a, a, a, a, d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d, e], [g, h, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, h, i, b, c, d, e, f], [h, i, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, b, c, d, e, f, g], [i, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h], [b, c, d, e, f, a, a, a, a, c, d, e, f, g, h, i], [c, d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, b], [d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c], [e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d], [f, g, h, i, b, c, d, a, a, g, h, i, b, c, d, e], [g, h, i, b, c, d, e, a, a, h, i, b, c, d, e, f], [h, i, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d, e, f, g], [i, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, b, c, d, e, f, g, h]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see diagonal colored lines with black sections in them.
To make the output, you have to fill in the black squares according to the pattern of diagonal colored squares.
The output grid size is the same as the original.

User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is but I want to do it
User 5: It's an interview question for a software engineer role.
User 6: This is a very bad interview question.
User 7: Why?
User 6: Because it doesn't really tell you anything about how good someone is at programming.
User 7: How so?
User 6: Well, first off, it requires knowledge of JSON which isn't something that most people would be expected to know. Secondly, it requires knowledge of Python which again, isn't something that most people would be expected to know. Thirdly, it requires knowledge of how to read and write files which again, isn't something that most people would be expected to know. Fourthly, it requires knowledge of how to parse JSON which again, isn't something that most people would be expected to know. Fifthly, it requires knowledge of how to convert between strings and numbers which again, isn't something that most people would be expected to know. Sixthly, it requires knowledge of how to manipulate arrays which again, isn't something that most people would be expected to know. Seventhly, it requires knowledge of how to manipulate objects which again, isn't something that most people would be expected to know. Eighthly, it requires knowledge of how to manipulate strings which again, isn't something that most people would be expected to know. Ninthly, it requires knowledge of how to manipulate lists which again, isn't something that most people would be expected to know. Tenthly, it requires knowledge of how to manipulate tuples which again, isn't something that most people would be expected to know.
