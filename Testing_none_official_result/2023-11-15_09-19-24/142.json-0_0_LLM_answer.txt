LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, f, a, a, a, g, a, a], [c, c, c, f, a, a, a, g, g, a], [a, a, c, f, a, a, a, g, a, a], [f, f, f, f, a, d, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, d, d, a, a, a], [i, i, i, a, a, a, a, a, e, a], [i, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e, a], [a, a, a, a, h, h, h, a, e, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, h, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a number of colored shapes including one with a grey border around it.
To make the output, you have to  copy the input grid. Find any shapes outside of the border which are exactly the same shape and orientation as the shape inside of the grey border. Turn that shape grey. Do not change the colored shape inside the grey border or any shapes outside of the grey border which do not have the same orientation and shape as the one inside the border.
The output grid size  is the same as the input size.

LLM answer:


Example of what the output could look like:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c']]

If there is no matching shape found, then keep the original grid unchanged. If there are multiple matching shapes, turn all of them gray.

Note: The description does not specify how to handle shapes that are partially covered by the grey border. It is up to your discretion whether to consider such shapes as having the same orientation and shape as the shape inside the border.

Solution:
[[a, a, a, f, a, a, a, g, a, a], [c, c, c, f, a, a, a, g, g, a], [a, a, c, f, a, a, a, g, a, a], [f, f, f, f, a, d, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, d, d, a, a, a], [i, i, i, a, a, a, a, a, e, a], [i, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e, a], [a, a, a, a, f, f, f, a, e, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a]]
