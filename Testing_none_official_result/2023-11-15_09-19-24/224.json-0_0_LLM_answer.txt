LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, d, b, a, a], [a, a, c, f, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a 6x6 grid with a 2x2 colored square, where each corner of the square is a different color.
To make the output, you have to  copy the input grid. Then, you will add 4 2x2 blocks to the grid, each touching the corner of the 2x2 colored square in the input. The color of each 2x2 block should be the same color as the opposite corner of the 2x2 colored square. If the 2x2 colored square is not in the center of the input, some of the 2x2 blocks you are adding may be off the page.
The output grid size  is the same as the input grid size.

LLM answer:


Example:
Input Grid:
[a, a, a, a, a, a]
[a, a, a, a, a, a]
[a, a, a, a, a, a]
[a, a, d, b, a, a]
[a, a, c, f, a, a]
[a, a, a, a, a, a]

Output Grid:
[a, a, a, a, a, a]
[a, a, a, a, a, a]
[a, a, a, a, a, a]
[a, a, d, b, a, a]
[a, a, c, f, a, a]
[a, a, e, h, i, g]
[a, a, j, k, l, m]
[n, o, p, q, r, s]
[t, u, v, w, x, y]

Note that the top left corner of the output grid has been filled with the letters e, h, i, g, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y. These letters do not appear in the input grid. They are added to the output grid because they are the same color as the corners of the 2x2 colored square in the input grid.

If there are any errors in your code, please provide detailed error messages.

Solution:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a], [f, f, a, a, c, c], [f, f, a, a, c, c], [a, a, d, b, a, a], [a, a, c, f, a, a], [b, b, a, a, d, d]]
