LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, e, e], [c, d, c], [d, c, d]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see A 3 x 3 grid of color squares.
To make the output, you have to When three colors are present make a grey diagonal line from top right to bottom left.  If there are two colors make a grey diagonal line from top left to bottom right.  If there is one color make a grey line across the top three blocks.
The output grid size Copy the input grid

LLM answer:
 dimensions.

Input grid: [[e, e, e], [c, d, c], [d, c, d]]
Output grid:?

Hint: Try to understand the instructions first before attempting to code.

Note: The input and output grids will always be square shaped.

This is an example problem. There will be many more problems like this that require you to read and interpret descriptions of transformations and apply them to input grids.

Solution:
[[a, a, f], [a, f, a], [f, a, a]]
