LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[g, g, g, g, g, g], [c, c, c, c, c, c]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a pattern with two colors
To make the output, you have to start with the color that is on the top. Fill in that line with that color every other square, begin with first square. Fill in the rest in that line with the second color. For the next line, start with the color that is already there (the second color) and fill in in the same every other square pattern. It should look like a game board. The first color in every line is the color of the input grid
The output grid size keep the same

LLM answer:
 as the input grid.

Example:
Input Grid: [[g, g, g, g, g, g], [c, c, c, c, c, c]]
Output Grid: [[g, g, c, g, c, g], [c, g, c, g, c, c]]
Note: The above example is just one possible solution for the described problem. There may be multiple ways to achieve this.

I need your help in solving this task. Please provide me with the JSON response and the corresponding output grid.

Regards,
[Your Name]
