LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, a, f, f, f, f, f, f, a, a, a, a], [i, a, f, f, f, f, f, f, a, a, a, a], [b, a, f, f, f, f, f, f, a, a, a, a], [b, a, f, f, f, f, f, f, a, f, f, f], [h, a, f, f, f, f, f, f, a, f, f, f], [h, a, f, f, f, f, f, f, a, f, f, f], [h, a, a, a, a, a, f, f, f, f, f, f], [h, a, a, a, a, a, f, f, f, a, a, a], [i, a, a, a, a, a, f, f, f, a, a, a], [i, a, f, f, f, a, f, f, f, a, a, a], [i, a, f, f, f, a, f, f, f, a, a, a], [i, a, f, f, f, a, f, f, f, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a line of colored squares and a number of grey boxes
To make the output, you have to fill in each box of the grey squares with whichever color from the colored line on the side is on the same row as it
The output grid size is the same as the input grid size

LLM answer:
.

Example:
Input:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c']]
Description:
"There is one row of colored squares and two rows of grey boxes. Fill in each grey box with the color that appears on the same row as it."
Output:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c']]
Explanation:
The first row has three squares, so we can fill in the first row of the second block with those colors. The second row has two squares, so we can fill in the second row of the second block with those colors.

Input:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c']]
Description:
