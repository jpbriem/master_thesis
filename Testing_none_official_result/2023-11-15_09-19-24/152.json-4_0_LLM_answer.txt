LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, i], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see two colored shapes on a black background
To make the output, you have to fit the the two colored shapes together to form a square.
The output grid size should be 3x3

LLM answer:
.
The top left corner should be blue, middle should be red and bottom right corner should be green.
If there is any overlap between the two shapes, then that region should be yellow.
If there is no overlap, then the background should remain black.

Example of expected output: [[a, b, j], [b, f, e], [j, e, a]]
Note: The above example is just an illustration, actual output may vary depending on how you interpret the description.

Hint: Think about how you can align the two shapes so they form a square without overlapping. What would happen if one shape was shifted? How could you determine which regions should turn yellow?

Solution:
[[i, i, c], [i, c, c], [i, i, i]]
