LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, c, c], [c, a, b], [b, c, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a 3x3 grid of colored squares with
To make the output, you have to Visualize the output grid as nine 3x3 blocks. The red squares on your input indicate which 'blocks' in your 9x9 grid you should work in. Copy the 3x3 input pattern to the 'blocks' indicated by the location of the red squares.
The output grid size is 9x9

LLM answer:
.
If there is no red square in a particular block, then that block should be filled with black.

Example: If the input has a red square at position (2,2), then the output grid at position (6,6) should contain the same 3x3 pattern as the input grid.

Note: There can be multiple red squares in the input grid.

Input grid: [[b, c, c], [c, a, b], [b, c, a]]
Output grid:?

Hint: Try to visualize the 9x9 grid and identify the locations of the red squares. Then, copy the 3x3 patterns accordingly.

This is an AI challenge. Good luck!

Solution:
[[a, a, a, b, c, c, b, c, c], [a, a, a, c, a, b, c, a, b], [a, a, a, b, c, a, b, c, a], [b, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a], [c, a, b, a, a, a, a, a, a], [b, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, c, c, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, c, a, a, a, a]]
