LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, f, a], [f, a, f], [a, f, a], [a, d, a], [d, a, d], [a, d, a], [g, a, g], [g, g, a], [g, a, g], [a, e, a], [e, a, e], [a, e, a], [a, i, a], [i, a, i], [a, i, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see different patterns of different colors
To make the output, you have to find the color with the most spaces colored and put that pattern into the 3x3
The output grid size will be 3x3

LLM answer:

The top left corner of the output grid will be filled with the most frequent color found in the input
The middle row of the output grid will be filled with the second most frequent color found in the input
The bottom right corner of the output grid will be filled with the third most frequent color found in the input
If there are more than three distinct colors in the input, then the remaining colors will be placed randomly in the output grid
If there are less than three distinct colors in the input, then the output grid will contain random colors

Example:
Input Grid: [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]
Output Grid: [[a, d, g], [e, f, h], [c, i,?]]
Explanation:
The most frequent color in the input is 'a' which appears twice. So, we place 'a' in the top left corner of the output grid.
The second most frequent color in the input is 'd' which appears twice. So, we place 'd' in the middle row of the output grid.
The third most frequent color in the input is 'g' which appears twice. So, we place 'g' in the bottom right corner of the output grid.
The remaining color 'c' appears once, so we place it randomly in the output grid.
Note that the question mark '?' in the output grid indicates a random color.

So, the final output would look like this:
{
"input_grid": "[[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]",
"instructions": "Find the color with the most spaces colored and put that pattern into the 3x3 output grid. Fill the top left corner of the output grid with the most frequent color found in the input. Fill the middle row of the output grid with the second most frequent color found in the input. Fill the bottom right corner of the output grid with the third most frequent color found in the input.",
"output_dimension": "3x3",
"test_output": "[[a, d, g], [e, f, h], [c, i,?]]"
}
