LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, c, a, a, a, f], [a, c, a, a, a, a, d, c, a], [a, d, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a, c], [f, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d, a], [f, d, a, a, a, f, a, c, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a small grid with green and red pixels touching.
To make the output, you have to if the red and green pixels are touching (not including diagonal touching) remove the red pixel (change it the same color as the background) and make the green pixel that it was touching light blue. Leave gray pixels and single green and red pixels alone.
The output grid size same as the input.

LLM answer:


Example of how the function should work:
Input Grid: [[a, b, a], [a, c, a], [a, d, a], [f, e, f], [a, f, a], [f, d, f], [a, g, a], [f, h, f], [i, j, i]]
Output Grid: [[a, b, a], [a, light blue, a], [a, d, a], [f, e, f], [a, f, a], [f, d, f], [a, g, a], [f, h, f], [i, j, i]]

Note: The above example is just an illustration, your task is to solve the problem described in the prompt.

Hint: Try to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and think about what can be done for each subproblem.
