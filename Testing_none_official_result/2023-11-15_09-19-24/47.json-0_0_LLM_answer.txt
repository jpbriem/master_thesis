LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[c, c, i, i, a, i], [c, c, a, i, a, a], [i, i, a, a, a, i], [a, i, i, i, a, a], [i, a, i, a, a, i], [a, a, i, c, c, a], [i, a, a, c, c, a], [a, i, a, a, a, i]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see Blue grid and two red squares with the random Black grid.
To make the output, you have to make the color of the square the same color as the square that is five down and three across of the input.
The output grid size 1 grid square.

LLM answer:


Example: If the blue square is at position (x,y) then the red square at position (x+5, y+3) will be the same color as the blue square.

If there is no such square, leave the cell empty.

Note: There can be multiple red squares.

Input Grid: [[c, c, i, i, a, i], [c, c, a, i, a, a], [i, i, a, a, a, i], [a, i, i, i, a, a], [i, a, i, a, a, i], [a, a, i, c, c, a], [i, a, a, c, c, a], [a, i, a, a, a, i]]
Output Grid: [[a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Explanation:
The blue square is located at position (1,1) and (4,4).
The red square at position (6,7) has the same color as the blue square at position (1,1). Therefore, we set the cell at position (6,7) to 'a'.
Similarly, the red square at position (9,8) has the same color as the blue square at position (4,4). Therefore, we set the cell at position (9,8) to 'a'.
All other cells remain unchanged since they do not have any matching red squares.
