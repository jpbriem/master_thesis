LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[h, h, h, h], [a, h, h, h], [h, a, a, a], [h, a, h, a], [e, e, e, e], [a, c, c, c], [a, a, a, a], [c, a, c, c], [a, c, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see one 9x4 grid separated into two grids with a yellow set of horizontal boxes.
To make the output, you have to put the two section over top of each other. Then you have to look at each block.  A block that does not have any of the pattern from the old blocks is colored green.  Any block that has pattern from either of the first blocks is colored black.
The output grid size is the size of one of the two section, 4x4.

LLM answer:


Example of what the output should look like: [[g, g, g, g], [g, b, b, b], [g, b, g, b], [g, b, b, g]]
Note: The above description is just an example, your task is to follow the instructions and create the output grid accordingly.

Input Grid:

Output:
{
"input_grid": "A 9x4 grid separated into two sections of 4x4 and 5x4",
"instructions": "Place the two sections on top of each other, then for each block, if it doesn't have any patterns from the original blocks, color it green, otherwise color it black.",
"output_dimension": "4x4",
"test_output": [[g, g, g, g], [g, b, b, b], [g, b, g, b], [g, b, b, g]]
}

Can you help me solve this problem? I am having trouble understanding how to implement the instructions to get the desired output.

Solution:
[[a, a, a, a], [d, a, a, a], [a, d, a, a], [a, a, a, d]]
