LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, d, a, a, d, a], [a, j, j, a, a, d, d, d, d, a], [a, j, j, a, a, a, a, a, d, a], [j, j, j, j, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, e, e, e, e, e, a], [a, a, a, a, e, a, a, e, e, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see several figures on a big grid.
To make the output, you have to copy one of the figures and just that figure.
The output grid size is the same size as one of the figures, zooming in

LLM answer:
 on the original grid.
The figure to be copied is chosen randomly.
The coordinate system for the output grid is the same as the input grid.
The output grid has the same color scheme as the input grid.
The figure to be copied must be rotated randomly between 90 degrees and 270 degrees.
The rotation angle will be uniformly distributed between 90 and 270 degrees.
The center of the output grid will always coincide with the center of the random figure.
The output grid will always contain all the colors present in the original grid.
The output grid will never contain any new colors that were not present in the original grid.
The output grid will have no empty spaces.
The output grid will have the same resolution as the input grid.
The output grid will be returned as a list of lists of strings.
Each string in the list of lists will correspond to a single pixel in the output grid.
Each string will be a single character representing the color of the corresponding pixel.
The order of the characters in each list will match the order of the pixels in the corresponding row of the output grid.
The first item in each list will correspond to the top-left pixel of the output grid, and so on.
The last item in each list will correspond to the bottom-right pixel of the output grid.
The output grid will be surrounded by an empty border of width 1, containing no colors.
This means that if the output grid has dimensions m x n, then the actual grid will have dimensions m+2 x n+2, with the outermost layer being empty.
The output grid will be returned as a list of lists of strings, with each string representing a single pixel.
The first item in each list will correspond to the top-left pixel of the output grid, and so on.
The last item in each list will correspond to the bottom-right pixel of the output grid.
The output grid will be surrounded by an empty border of width 1, containing no colors.
