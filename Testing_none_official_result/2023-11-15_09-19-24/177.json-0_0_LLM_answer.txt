LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, b, c, d, d, d, i, i, e], [b, b, c, d, d, d, i, i, e], [b, b, c, d, d, d, i, i, e], [b, b, c, d, d, d, i, i, e]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see good sections
To make the output, you have to output pattern set
The output grid size grid size change to correctly

LLM answer:
 reflect the aspect ratio of the original image.
The top-left corner of the output grid should be at position (1,1)
The bottom-right corner of the output grid should be at position (8,6)
The left side of the output grid should have a thickness of 4 cells
The right side of the output grid should have a thickness of 5 cells
The top side of the output grid should have a thickness of 3 cells
The bottom side of the output grid should have a thickness of 4 cells
The corners of the output grid should have a thickness of 2 cells each
All remaining cells in the output grid should have a thickness of 1 cell
The output grid should have a total of 9 rows and 13 columns
The first row of the output grid should contain all the colors present in the input grid
The last row of the output grid should contain all the colors present in the input grid
The first column of the output grid should contain all the colors present in the input grid
The last column of the output grid should contain all the colors present in the input grid
The colors in the output grid should follow the same order as they appear in the input grid
The colors in the output grid should maintain their relative positions in their respective rows and columns
The output grid should not have any duplicate colors in any row or column
The output grid should not have any empty cells

Input Grid:
[['b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'i', 'i', 'e'],
 ['b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'i', 'i', 'e'],
 ['b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'i', 'i', 'e'],
 ['b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'i', 'i', 'e']]
Description:
In the input, you should see good sections
To make the output, you have to output pattern set
The output grid size grid size change to correctly reflect the aspect ratio of the original image.
The top-left corner of the output grid should be at position (1,1)
The bottom-right corner of the output grid should be at position (8,6)
The left side of the output grid should have a thickness of 4 cells

The colors in the output grid should maintain their relative positions in their respective rows and columns
The output grid should not have any duplicate colors in any row or column
The output grid should not have any empty cells

Output:
{
"input_grid": "A 4x4 grid with alternating colors",
"instructions": "Transform the input grid into a 9x13 grid while maintaining the aspect ratio, thickening the sides, and filling in missing colors",
"output_dimension": "9x13",
"test_output": [[['b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'i', 'i', 'e'],
