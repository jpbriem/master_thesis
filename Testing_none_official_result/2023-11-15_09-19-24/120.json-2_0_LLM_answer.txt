LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, b, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, h, h, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, h, i, h, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, h, a, a], [a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d, d, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d, d, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see different shapes, one of which contain a light blue dot.
To make the output, you have to copy the shape with the light blue dot but replace the light blue dot with the shape color.
The output grid size must match the size of the shape with the blue dot.

LLM answer:

If there are multiple shapes containing the light blue dot, choose the first one encountered.

Example of expected output:
{
"input_grid": "A 6x8 grid with various colors",
"instructions": "Copy the shape with the light blue dot and replace the dot with the shape color",
"output_dimension": "4x5",
"test_output": [[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
}

Note that the output grid has the same number of rows as the original grid, but fewer columns since we only need to include the part of the grid that contains the shape with the light blue dot. Also note that the order of the colors in the output grid does not matter, as long as they correctly correspond to the colors in the original grid.

Solution:
[[a, h, h], [h, h, h], [a, h, a]]
