LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c], [f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see colored squares
To make the output, you have to copy one half of the input.
The output grid size half the input. Cut the long way in half.

LLM answer:

If there is an odd number of rows, add a new row below the middle row.
If there is an odd number of columns, add a new column between the two middle columns.

Example:
Input: [[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c], [f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]
Output: [[f, e], [e, f], [g, g], [c, c], [f, e], [e, f], [g, g], [c, c]]
Note that the top and bottom rows and left and rightmost columns are missing in the output because they were cut off when cutting the input in half.
Also, note that the order of the elements in each row does not matter.

Hint: Think about how you can split the input grid into halves both horizontally and vertically.

Here is an example of what your JSON response could look like:
{
"input_grid": "A 6x8 grid with alternating colors",
"instructions": "Cut the input grid in half both horizontally and vertically",
"output_dimension": "A 3x4 grid",
"test_output": [[[f, e], [e, f], [g, g], [c, c]],
        [[f, e], [e, f], [g, g], [c, c]],
        [[f, e], [e, f], [g, g], [c, c]]]
}

This is just an example, you need to adjust the dimensions and colors according to the given input and description.

Solution:
[[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]
