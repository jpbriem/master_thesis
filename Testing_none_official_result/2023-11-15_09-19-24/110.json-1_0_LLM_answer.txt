LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, d, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, d, d, a, a], [a, a, d, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, d, d, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, d, a, a, a, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, d, d, d, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, d, d, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a same grid with different areas colored. One of those areas includes a grey square.
To make the output, you have to  repeat the colored area that includes a grey square, but don't include the grey square.
The output grid size  is 3x3 grid.

LLM answer:


Example of what the output could look like: [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]].

Note: The input grid has been given as a list of lists, where each element in the inner list corresponds to a pixel value. In your response, please ensure that the output grid is also represented as a list of lists, with each element in the inner list being a pixel value. Additionally, please ensure that the pixel values in the output grid are correctly mapped to their corresponding colors, using the color mapping provided in the problem statement.

Solution:
[[a, d, a], [d, d, a], [a, d, d]]
