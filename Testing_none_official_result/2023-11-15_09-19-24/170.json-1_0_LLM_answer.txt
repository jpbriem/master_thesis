LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see black grid
To make the output, you have to use light blue color to draw the border of the grid with only one cell as width
The output grid size the same size

LLM answer:
 as the input grid
The cells that are not part of the border should be filled with dark blue color
The corners of the grid should be rounded using cyan color
The final result should look like a nice neat frame with rounded corners
The dimensions of the output grid should be the same as the input grid
The output should be returned as a list of lists of strings
The order of the elements in each sublist should follow the order of the original grid
Each element in each sublist should correspond to a single cell in the output grid
The top-left corner of the grid should be at position (0, 0)
The bottom-right corner of the grid should be at position (5, 6)
The grid should have a total of 6 rows and 7 columns
The input grid is represented by the letter 'a'
The output grid should be represented by the letters 'l','m', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r','s', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'
The letters 'l','m', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r','s', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z' should be used to represent the colors of the output grid
The letter 'l' should represent the light blue color
The letter'm' should represent the dark blue color
The letter 'n' should represent the cyan color
The letter 'o' should represent the yellow color
The letter 'p' should represent the green color
The letter 'q' should represent the red color
The letter 'r' should represent the magenta color
The letter's' should represent the orange color
The letter 't' should represent the brown color
The letter 'u' should represent the gray color
The letter 'v' should represent the purple color
The letter 'w' should represent the pink color
The letter 'x' should represent the teal color
The letter 'y' should represent the turquoise color
The letter 'z' should represent the violet color

Input Grid:
[a, a, a, a, a, a],

[a, a, a, a, a, a],
[a, a, a, a, a, a],
[a, a, a, a, a, a],

[z, z, z, z, z, z]

Note: All the characters in the output grid should be lowercase.

Please provide your answer in JSON format.

I tried solving this problem but I am getting an error. Can someone help me?

Also, please let me know how can I improve my coding skills and problem-solving abilities?

Thank you!
