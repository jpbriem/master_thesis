LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[j, g, c, j, j, c, g, j], [c, j, j, g, g, j, j, c], [g, j, j, c, c, j, j, g], [j, c, g, j, j, g, c, j]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a multi-colored grid with random patterns.
To make the output, you have to copy the colors used in the top left corner of four squares of the grid and make them the corresponding colors on the output 2x2 grid. So if the top left has a red square, then a yellow square with a blue square below the red square and a green square below the yellow square, then those would be placed in the corresponding squares on the output grid.
The output grid size is reduced to a 2x2 grid.

LLM answer:

If there is no color in one of the corners, then that corner should remain empty.
If there is no color in two opposite corners, then the other two corners should mirror each other.
If there is no color in three corners, then the fourth corner should be filled with the same color as the remaining corner.
If all four corners have colors, then they should be arranged in the order red, yellow, blue, green.
If any of the colors in the top left corner are missing, then they should be replaced with black.
If there is no color in the entire top row, then the whole row should be filled with black.
If there is no color in the entire left column, then the whole column should be filled with black.
If there is no color in the entire grid, then the whole grid should be filled with black.

Input Grid:
[['j', 'g', 'c', 'j'], ['c', 'j', 'j', 'g'], ['g', 'j', 'j', 'c'], ['j', 'c', 'g', 'j']]

Output Grid:
[['r', 'y'], ['b', 'g']]

Explanation:
The top left corner contains the colors red, yellow, blue, and green, so these colors are copied to the corresponding positions in the output 2x2 grid. Since there are no colors in the top right corner, it remains empty. The bottom left corner contains the colors green and yellow, which are mirrored in the bottom right corner. The top right corner is empty, so it is filled with black. The final output grid is [['r', 'y'], ['b', 'g']].
