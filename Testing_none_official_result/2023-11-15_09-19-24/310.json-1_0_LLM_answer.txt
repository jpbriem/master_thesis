LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[h, h, a], [a, h, a], [a, a, h]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see an orange shape on a black background
To make the output, you have to create a left-right mirror of pattern of the orange shape.
The output grid size  has twice as many rows, but the same height

LLM answer:
 as the input grid.
The top half of each cell in the output grid contains the original color of the cell, while the bottom half contains the reflected version of the color.
If there is no cell below a certain point, then that point will be empty.

Example:
Input Grid: [[h, h, a], [a, h, a], [a, a, h]]
Output Grid: [[h, h, a, a], [a, h, a, h], [a, a, h, a]]
Note: The cells in the output grid are arranged such that the first cell in each row is the top-left corner of the original cell, followed by the second cell in the row which is the top-right corner of the original cell and so on.

Hint: Use numpy for easy manipulation of arrays.

Expected Output:
{
"input_grid": "[[h, h, a], [a, h, a], [a, a, h]]",
"instructions": "Create a left-right mirror of the orange shape. The output grid size has twice as many rows, but the same height as the input grid. The top half of each cell in the output grid contains the original color of the cell, while the bottom half contains the reflected version of the color.",
"output_dimension": "3x6",
"test_output": "[[h, h, a, a], [a, h, a, h], [a, a, h, a]]"
}

This is a sample problem statement. Please solve this and provide the solution in the required format.
