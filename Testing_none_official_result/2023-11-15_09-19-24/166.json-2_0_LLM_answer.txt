LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, e, e], [c, d, c], [d, c, d]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see an image with 1 to 3 colors
To make the output, you have to make a black and gray pattern depending on the number of colors in the input.  Start with an all black grid.  If there is one color, make the top 3 squares gray.  If there are two colors, make a diagonal line from top left to bottom right gray, again 3 pixels.  If there are three colors, make a diagonal line from top right to bottom left gray, again 3 pixels.
The output grid size stays the same

LLM answer:
.

Example:
Input: [[e, e, e], [c, d, c], [d, c, d]]
Output: [[a, a, a], [f, f, f], [f, f, f]]
Explanation:
The input has 3 colors: red, blue, green. So we need to make a diagonal line from top right to bottom left gray, which is 3 pixels wide.

Note that the input and output grids are represented as lists of lists of characters, where each character corresponds to a color. Also, note that the dimensions of the input and output grids do not change. Only the colors of some cells are modified according to the described pattern.

Solution:
[[a, a, f], [a, f, a], [f, a, a]]
