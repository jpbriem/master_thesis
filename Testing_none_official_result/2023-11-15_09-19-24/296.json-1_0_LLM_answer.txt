LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, c, d, e, i], [f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see grids in the first row with different filled colors
To make the output, you have to filled the black grid from the third row with the colors specified in the first row. For example, fill the third row with the color in the first row and first column, and repeat.
The output grid size should be the same

LLM answer:
 as the input grid size.

Example of expected output:
{
"input_grid": "A 3x5 grid with colors b, c, d, e, i in the first row, and a, a, a, a, a in the second and third rows",
"instructions": "Fill the black grid from the third row with the colors specified in the first row",
"output_dimension": "3x5",
"test_output": [[b, c, d, e, i], [f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
}

Note that the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, but with the colors from the first row repeated in the remaining rows.

Solution:
[[b, c, d, e, i], [f, f, f, f, f], [b, b, b, b, b], [c, c, c, c, c], [d, d, d, d, d], [e, e, e, e, e], [i, i, i, i, i], [b, b, b, b, b], [c, c, c, c, c], [d, d, d, d, d], [e, e, e, e, e], [i, i, i, i, i]]
