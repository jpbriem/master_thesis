LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, c, a, e, e, a, c, a, e, e, a, c, a, e, e], [c, c, a, e, e, c, c, a, e, e, c, c, a, e, e], [a, c, c, c, a, a, c, c, c, a, a, c, c, c, a], [b, b, a, c, c, b, b, a, c, c, b, b, a, c, c], [b, b, a, c, a, b, b, a, c, a, b, b, a, c, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a pattern of colored blocks repeated several times from left to right in the grid.
To make the output, you have to zoom in on one example of the colored pattern and paste it into the grid of the correct size.
The output grid size  is the size of one example of the colored block pattern.

LLM answer:

The output grid has the same number of rows and columns as the input grid but with all elements set to 'a'.
The instructions for creating the output grid are:
1. Find an example of the colored block pattern in the input grid.
2. Zoom in on that pattern so that each element of the pattern becomes a separate block in the output grid.
3. Set all elements of the output grid to 'a'.
4. Resize the output grid to be the same size as the input grid.
5. Replace any existing elements in the output grid with the corresponding elements from the input grid.
6. Return the final output grid.
Example: If the input grid contains the pattern [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]], then the output grid would look like this: [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]].
Note: The pattern can appear anywhere in the input grid, and there may be multiple instances of the pattern. Your task is to find one instance and use it to generate the output grid.

Solution:
[[a, c, a, e, e], [c, c, a, e, e], [a, c, c, c, a], [b, b, a, c, c], [b, b, a, c, a]]
