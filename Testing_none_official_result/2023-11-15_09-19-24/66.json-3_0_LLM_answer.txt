LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, c, a, e, e, a, c, a, e, e, a, c, a, e, e], [c, c, a, e, e, c, c, a, e, e, c, c, a, e, e], [a, c, c, c, a, a, c, c, c, a, a, c, c, c, a], [b, b, a, c, c, b, b, a, c, c, b, b, a, c, c], [b, b, a, c, a, b, b, a, c, a, b, b, a, c, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  A repeating pattern (usually repeats three times)
To make the output, you have to  fill the grid up with the singular identified pattern
The output grid size  should be set to the equivalent grid size that the singular pattern takes up

LLM answer:
 when repeated.

Example: If the singular pattern is 4x4, then the output grid should be 4x4.
If the singular pattern is 6x6, then the output grid should be 6x6.

So, for this problem, we need to identify the singular pattern first. Then, we can determine the size of the output grid accordingly.

Note: The input grid has been given as a sample input. In your actual implementation, you will receive the input grid as a list of lists of characters.

Input Grid: [[a, c, a, e, e, a, c, a, e, e, a, c, a, e, e], [c, c, a, e, e, c, c, a, e, e, c, c, a, e, e], [a, c, c, c, a, a, c, c, c, a, a, c, c, c, a], [b, b, a, c, c, b, b, a, c, c, b, b, a, c, c], [b, b, a, c, a, b, b, a, c, a, b, b, a, c, a]]

Output:
{
"input_grid": "A repeating pattern (usually repeats three times)",
"instructions": "fill the grid up with the singular identified pattern",
"output_dimension": "4x4",
"test_output": [[a, c, a, e], [c, c, a, e], [a, c, c, e], [b, b, a, e]]
}

Explanation:
The input grid contains a repeating pattern of 'a', 'c', and 'e'. We can observe this pattern thrice in the input grid. Therefore, we need to fill the entire grid with this pattern.
The output grid size should be 4x4 since the singular pattern is 4x4.
Hence, the output grid would look like this: [[a, c, a, e], [c, c, a, e], [a, c, c, e], [b, b, a, e]].

Solution:
[[a, c, a, e, e], [c, c, a, e, e], [a, c, c, c, a], [b, b, a, c, c], [b, b, a, c, a]]
