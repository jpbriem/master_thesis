LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[c, i, i, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [i, i, b, i, a, a, c, i, b, a], [b, c, i, b, a, a, i, i, i, a], [i, i, i, i, a, a, c, b, i, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, c, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, c, i, b, a], [a, b, c, i, c, a, b, i, i, a], [a, i, i, b, i, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, c, i, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see several rectangular shapes with dark blue, light blue, and red
To make the output, you have to copy the rectangular shape with the most red squares exactly
The output grid size is the size of the rectangular shape with the most red squares

LLM answer:

The output grid should be filled with the same pattern as the original grid but with all the cells set to the value 'a' except for the ones that were originally red which should remain unchanged.
If there are multiple such rectangles, choose the one with the highest y-coordinate. If there are still multiple such rectangles after this filter, then choose the one with the highest x-coordinate.

Input Grid: [[c, i, i, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [i, i, b, i, a, a, c, i, b, a], [b, c, i, b, a, a, i, i, i, a], [i, i, i, i, a, a, c, b, i, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, c, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, c, i, b, a], [a, b, c, i, c, a, b, i, i, a], [a, i, i, b, i, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, c, i, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Output Grid: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Explanation:
The input grid contains several rectangular shapes with dark blue, light blue, and red. To make the output, we need to copy the rectangular shape with the most red squares exactly. We can see that the rectangle with the most red squares has its top-left corner at position (2,2) and its bottom-right corner at position (5,6). Its dimensions are 4 rows and 4 columns.
We fill the output grid with the same pattern as the original grid but with all the cells set to the value 'a' except for the ones that were originally red which should remain unchanged.
The resulting output grid has dimensions 4x4 and looks like this: [[a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a]]
Note that there are other rectangles with red squares in the input grid, but none of them have more red squares than the one we chose. Also, note that the output grid is not the entire grid, but rather the sub-grid that corresponds to the chosen rectangle.

Solution:
[[c, i, b], [i, i, i], [c, b, i], [i, i, c], [c, i, b], [b, i, i]]
