LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, e, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, e, a, f, a, a, e, f, e, e, a], [e, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, e, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, e, a], [e, a, a, f, a, e, a, f, e, a, e], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, a, e, a, f, a, a, e], [e, a, a, f, a, a, e, f, a, e, a], [a, a, a, f, e, e, a, f, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 9 black boxes with colored blocks inside them
To make the output, you have to find the black box or boxes with the highest number of colored blocks in the input grid. The corresponding box or boxes in the output grid should be colored entirely that color. The rest of the boxes should be all black
The output grid size is the same as the input grid size

LLM answer:
.

Example:
Input Grid:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c']]
Description:
Find the black box with the most number of colored blocks. If there are multiple such boxes, then choose one of them randomly. Color the entire box with the color of the block inside it.
Output Grid:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c']]
Explanation:
There are two black boxes in this input grid. One has two blue blocks and one red block, while the other has three red blocks. Since both boxes have an equal number of colored blocks, we can choose either box randomly. Let's say we choose the first box. We will color the entire first box blue since it contains two blue blocks. The second box remains unchanged because it already has three red blocks. Therefore, the output grid will look like this:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c']]
Note: In case there are no black boxes in the input grid, the output grid should remain empty.

Solution:
[[e, e, e, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [e, e, e, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [e, e, e, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, f, e, e, e, f, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, e, e, e, f, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, e, e, e, f, a, a, a]]
