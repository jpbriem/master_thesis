LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c], [f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see colored squares with a pattern
To make the output, you have to cut the grid in half to take away one of the patterns and leave one of the patterns
The output grid size  is half of the input

LLM answer:
 grid size
The top left corner of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the bottom right corner of the input grid
The bottom left corner of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the top right corner of the input grid
The remaining cells of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the cell that is directly above them in the input grid
If there is no cell directly above a cell in the output grid, then it should be filled with the same color as the cell that is directly to the left of it in the input grid
If there is no cell directly to the left of a cell in the output grid, then it should be filled with the same color as the cell that is directly below it in the input grid
If there is no cell directly below a cell in the output grid, then it should be filled with the same color as the cell that is directly to the right of it in the input grid
If there is no cell directly to the right of a cell in the output grid, then it should be filled with the same color as the cell that is directly above it in the input grid

Input Grid: [[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c], [f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]
Output Grid: [[f, e], [e, f], [g, g], [c, c]]

Note: The input grid has an odd number of rows and columns, so when cutting it in half, some cells will be discarded. Also, the description specifies how to fill the cells of the output grid, but does not specify the order in which they should be filled.

Solution:
[[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]
