LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, f], [f, a, a], [a, f, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see two black blocks on each row from top to bottom
To make the output, you have to make the row green if two blocks appear together on the left, yellow if two blocks are separated by a gray block in the middle, and red if two blocks appear together on the right on each row
The output grid size does not change

LLM answer:
.

Example Output:
{
"input_grid": "Two black blocks on each row",
"instructions": "Make rows green if two blocks together on the left, yellow if two blocks separated by gray in the middle, red if two blocks together on the right",
"output_dimension": "2x3",
"test_output": [[["g", "g", "r"], ["y", "a", "y"]], [["g", "a", "r"], ["y", "a", "y"]]]
}
Note that the output grid has been transformed according to the description.

Solution:
[[d, d, d], [c, c, c], [e, e, e]]
