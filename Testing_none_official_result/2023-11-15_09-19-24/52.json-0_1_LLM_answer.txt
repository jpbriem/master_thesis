LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a], [a, b, a], [a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 3 by 3 grid blue color grid on black background
To make the output, you have to move all the blue color move down  by one grid
The output grid size same as input size

LLM answer:


Input grid: [[a, a, a], [a, b, a], [a, a, a]]
Output grid:?

Hint: Think about how you can apply the instructions to the input grid to get the output grid. What would be the dimensions of the output grid? How will you ensure that the blue color moves down by one grid?

Note: The input grid and output grid are both represented as lists of lists of characters. Each character in the list corresponds to a pixel in the grid, where 'a' represents the background color and 'b' represents the blue color.

Solution:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, b, a]]
