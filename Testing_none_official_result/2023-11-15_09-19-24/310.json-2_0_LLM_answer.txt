LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[h, h, a], [a, h, a], [a, a, h]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see the orange grid only
To make the output, you have to make the pattern mirror as left-right with the same height and twice the row.
The output grid size two times the row, but same height!

LLM answer:


Input grid: [[h, h, a], [a, h, a], [a, a, h]]
Output grid: [[h, h, a, a, h, h, a], [a, h, a, h, a, h, a], [a, a, h, a, h, h, a]]

Note that the input grid has three rows and three columns, while the output grid has six rows and three columns. Also, note that the colors in the input grid are represented by single letters such as 'h' for orange, 'a' for black, etc.

Your task is to provide the JSON response as described above, including the transformed output grid, based on the given input grid and description.

Solution:
[[h, h, a, a, h, h], [a, h, a, a, h, a], [a, a, h, h, a, a]]
