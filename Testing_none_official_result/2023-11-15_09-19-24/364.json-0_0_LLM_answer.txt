LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[c, i, i, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [i, i, b, i, a, a, c, i, b, a], [b, c, i, b, a, a, i, i, i, a], [i, i, i, i, a, a, c, b, i, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, c, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, c, i, b, a], [a, b, c, i, c, a, b, i, i, a], [a, i, i, b, i, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, c, i, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 2 or 3 different patterns with at least 1 red square inside.
To make the output, you have to create the pattern with the most red squares inside.
The output grid size the size of the pattern with the most red squares.

LLM answer:

If there are multiple patterns with the same amount of red squares, choose the one that appears first in the input.
If there are no red squares in the input, then the output should be empty.

Example of possible output:
{
"input_grid": "A 6x9 grid with 4 different patterns",
"instructions": "First pattern: 3 rows of 3 red squares each; Second pattern: 2 rows of 2 red squares each; Third pattern: 2 rows of 1 red square each; Fourth pattern: 1 row of 3 red squares",
"output_dimension": "3x3",
"test_output": [[["red", "red", "red"], ["red", "red", "red"], ["red", "red", "red"]], [["red", "red", "red"], ["red", "red", "red"], ["red", "red", "red"]], [["red", "red", "red"], ["red", "red", "red"], ["red", "red", "red"]]]
}
Note: The above output is just an example, you can have different dimensions for your output depending on the pattern found in the input.
Also, please note that the input grid is case insensitive, so even if the input has lowercase letters, the output should still work.

Solution:
[[c, i, b], [i, i, i], [c, b, i], [i, i, c], [c, i, b], [b, i, i]]
