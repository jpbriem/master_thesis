LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, i], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see two colored shapes.
To make the output, you have to Place the shapes together in the 3x3 grid so they form a square.
The output grid size a small 3x3 grid.

LLM answer:

The top-left corner of the grid should be empty.
The bottom-right corner of the grid should be empty.
The middle cell of the grid should be empty.
The shape that was originally at the top should now be at the bottom.
The shape that was originally at the left should now be at the right.
The shape that was originally at the bottom should now be at the top.
The shape that was originally at the right should now be at the left.

Input Grid:
[['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

Output Grid:
[['', '', ''], ['', 'c', ''], ['', '', '']]

Expected Output:
{
"input_grid": "A 3x3 grid with two colored shapes - a red 'c' and a blue 'a'.",
"instructions": "Place the shapes together in a 3x3 grid so they form a square.",
"output_dimension": "3x3",
"test_output": [[["", "", ""], ["", "c", ""], ["", "", ""]], [["", "", ""], ["", "", "c"], ["", "", ""]], [["", "", ""], ["", "", ""], ["", "", ""]]]
}

Note: The input grid is represented as a list of lists, where each element is a string representing a color. The output grid is also represented as a list of lists, where each element is an empty string or a color.

Solution:
[[i, i, c], [i, c, c], [i, i, i]]
