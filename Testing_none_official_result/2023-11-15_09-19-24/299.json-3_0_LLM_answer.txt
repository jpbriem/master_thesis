LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [e, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [e, e, a, d, d, d, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, d, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, d, a, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, d, a, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, g, g], [a, f, f, f, a, a, g, g, g], [a, f, f, a, a, a, g, g, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see colored grids with different pattern with black background
To make the output, you have to fully zoomed pattern of a highest color count among the gird
The output grid size fully zoomed size of a certain pattern

LLM answer:

The output color will be the most frequent color in that pattern
If there are multiple patterns with same frequency, choose one randomly
If there are no patterns, then just return the original input

Example:
Input Grid: [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]
Output Grid: [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]
Explanation: There are three different patterns in this input grid - a red pattern, a blue pattern, and a green pattern. Since all the patterns have the same frequency (one cell each), we can choose any one of them randomly. Let's say we choose the red pattern. So, the output grid would be the fully zoomed version of the red pattern, which is just the input grid itself.

Another Example:
Input Grid: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [e, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [e, e, a, d, d, d, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, d, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, d, a, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, d, a, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, g, g], [a, f, f, f, a, a, g, g, g], [a, f, f, a, a, a, g, g, a]]
Output Grid: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e], [e, e, e, d, d, d, e, e, e], [a, a, a, d, d, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, d, a, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, d, a, d, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, g, g], [a, f, f, f, a, a, g, g, g], [a, f, f, a, a, a, g, g, a]]
Explanation: In this input grid, there are four different patterns - a black pattern, a blue pattern, a red pattern, and a yellow pattern. The black pattern has the highest frequency (8 cells), followed by the blue pattern (4 cells), and then the red and yellow patterns (2 cells each). So, we choose the black pattern and fully zoom it to get the output grid.

Note: The input grid may contain duplicate patterns or irregularly shaped patterns. Also, the input grid may not have any patterns at all. In such cases, just return the original input grid.
