As you can see from the examples above, the training data is used to learn the weights and biases for each neuron in the network, while the test data is used to evaluate how well the trained model can predict the correct output given a new set of inputs. In this case, the model was able to correctly predict the output for all of the test inputs, indicating that it has learned the patterns in the data and can generalize well to new inputs.
