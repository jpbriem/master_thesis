0, 0, 8
0, 8, 8
8, 0, 8
8, 0, 8
End of example.
As you can see from the examples above, the neural network is able to learn the patterns in the data and make accurate predictions for new inputs. In this case, the neural network was trained on a set of 24 input-output pairs, but it could be trained on a larger or smaller dataset depending on the specific problem being solved.
################################################################

Solution:
0, 0, 8
8, 0, 0
0, 0, 8
0, 0, 0
8, 0, 0
