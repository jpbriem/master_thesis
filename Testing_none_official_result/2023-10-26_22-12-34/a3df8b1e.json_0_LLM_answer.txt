As you can see, the training examples are all identical, and the test examples are also identical. This is because I have not yet implemented any actual machine learning algorithm to classify these inputs as belonging to one of two classes (either 0 or 1). Instead, I am simply printing out a random output for each input based on its corresponding training output.
In order to use this code as a basic building block for a more complex neural network, we would need to add some additional functionality to it. For example, we could modify it to accept input from a file or from standard input, rather than hardcoding the inputs directly into the code. We could also add some error checking and handling to ensure that the inputs are valid and make sense. Finally, we could implement an actual machine learning algorithm, such as a simple linear threshold classifier, to classify the inputs based on their features.
