As you can see, the training data is used to learn the weights and biases for each neuron in the network, while the test data is used to evaluate how well the network performs on unseen data. In this case, the network seems to be able to accurately predict the output values for the test data, but it may not generalize well to new data that it has not seen before.
################################################################

Solution:
0, 0, 0, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0
