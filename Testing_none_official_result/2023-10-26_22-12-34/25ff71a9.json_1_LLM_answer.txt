The first column represents the input values for each row in the training set, and the second column represents the corresponding output values. The rows are labeled according to their class labels (0 or 1).
You can use this data to train a binary classification model using scikit-learn library in Python. Here is an example of how you could do it:
import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')
X = data[:, :2] # we only take the first two features
y = data[:, -1] # we take the last feature which is the label
print(X)
print(y)

# Train a logistic regression model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X, y)

# Predict on new data
new_data = [[5, 3], [4, 2], [6, 4]]
predictions = clf.predict(new_data)
print("Predicted labels:", predictions)

In this example, we load the dataset from a CSV file called "your_file.csv" using the `pd.read_csv()` function. We then select the first two features (the input variables) using the `[:, :2]` indexing notation, and the last feature (the label) using the `[-, -1]`. We print these arrays to verify that they contain the correct values.
Next, we create a logistic regression model using the `LogisticRegression()` class from scikit-learn's linear regression module. We fit the model to the training data using the `fit()` method, and then use the `predict()` method to make predictions on some new test data. Finally, we print the predicted labels to see if they match what we expect.
Note that this is just one possible way to preprocess and train a binary classification model using scikit-learn. There are many other ways to do it, and the specific approach will depend on your particular problem and dataset.
