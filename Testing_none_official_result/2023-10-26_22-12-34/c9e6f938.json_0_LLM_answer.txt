LLM answer:

7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0
0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0
0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7
End of example.
As you can see, the training data is a set of 5 examples, and the test data is also a set of 5 examples. The training data consists of inputs and outputs for each of the 3 possible patterns (0, 7, 0; 0, 0, 7; 0, 7, 7), while the test data only has one pattern (7, 7, 0). This means that the model will have to learn from these limited examples how to recognize the different patterns in the input data.

Solution:
7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7
0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0
0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0
