LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i], [a, a, c, a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see black background with blue squares and red squares.
To make the output, you have to  First, copy the input grid and leave it as it is. The blue squares act as a starting point for you to draw lines, so if the blue squares are on the left, you have to draw lines horizontally to the right and if the blue squares are at the top, you have to draw the line vertically down. Next, after copying the grid, draw lines from each blue squares and stop just before the grid with the first red square. Then you will start again to draw your second blue lines starting from the grid with the red square, however, you will have to move your line by one grid according to the position of your red square - if your red square is at the bottom, you will move the second line up by one grid, if your red square is at the right, you will have to move your second line left by one grid and if your red square is at the left, you will have to move your second line to the right by one grid. These second blue lines stop just before the grid with the second red square. You will then draw another set of blue lines with the same rule as the second line all the way to the end of the grid.
The output grid size is the same as the input grid.
