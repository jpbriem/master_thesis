LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[g, d, f], [g, i, a], [e, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a small black grid with a multicolored shape in it.
To make the output, you have to imagine that the entire grid has been flipped both horizontally and vertically. Once you picture that you can create the output grid.
The output grid size is the same as the input.

LLM answer:

'''
#!/bin/python3

import sys

def main():
    # open('input.txt').read() returns all text in file
    # readline() reads one line at a time
    # strip() removes whitespace characters like \n from each end of the string
    input = open("input.txt").read().strip()
    
    # split() splits a string wherever there is a space character
    # for example, "hello world" becomes ["hello", "world"]
    # we want to split our input string into an array of strings
    # so we can iterate over them using a for loop
    lines = input.split("\n")
    
    # initialize empty list to store transformed grid
    transformedGrid = []
    
    # iterate through each line in the input
    for line in lines:
        # split each line into an array of strings separated by spaces
        # this will give us an array of arrays
        # for example, ['hello', 'world'] becomes [['hello'], ['world']]
        words = line.split(" ")
        
        # iterate through each word in the current line
        for word in words:
            # add the current word to the transformed grid
            transformedGrid.append(word)
            
    # print the transformed grid
    print(transformedGrid)

Solution:
[[a, a, e], [a, i, g], [f, d, g]]
