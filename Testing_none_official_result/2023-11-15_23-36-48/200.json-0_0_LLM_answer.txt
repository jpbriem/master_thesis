LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, a, a, a, a, a, e, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, a, a, a, a, a, e, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, i, a, i, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, i, i, i, c, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, i, a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, i, a, a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  two vertical line shapes with yellow squares at the top and bottom, and two other shapes that join together with colors that match the middle part of the vertical line shapes.
To make the output, you have to  First, create a black grid according to the output grid size. Next, draw the vertical line shapes on the output grid identical to those on the input grid, and the space between the shapes should be the same too. Then, draw the other two shapes that join together in the middle of the grid, making sure that their colors match the colors of the middle part of the vertical line shapes. If the original color arrangement of the other shapes do not match the vertical line shapes, you need to flip the other shapes and draw them mirroring the original pattern so they match the color of the vertical line shapes.Note that the other two join shapes have to be drawn in the middle of the grid and nothing should be drawn on the grid where the yellow squares are.
The output grid size  the height is the same as the height of the vertical line shapes. The width is the same width as the grid between the vertical line shapes plus the two yellow squares.
