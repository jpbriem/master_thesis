Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two numbers are the same". The first number is a single digit (0-9), and the second number is also a single digit (0-9). They can be different or equal to each other.

Answer: You have a few problems here. Firstly, your `if` statement is checking if the \em{first} element in the list is less than the \em{second}. It should be comparing the first with the third instead. Secondly, you need to check that the first three elements are all the same before adding them together - otherwise you will get an error when trying to add something like `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. Thirdly, you don't want to return anything from this function; it doesn't make sense for it to do so. Instead, just print out the result. Finally, you shouldn't use `sum()` on a list of integers; it will give you the wrong answer. Just sum up the values yourself using addition.

Here's how I would write it:

\begin{code}
def find_total(input):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(input) // 3):
        if input[i] == input[i + 1] == input[i + 2]:
            total += input[i] * 3
    return total
\end{code}
