Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error. It can be used for classification (i.e., recognizing a pattern), but that's not how it works internally.

Answer: You are correct in your assumption that the neural net will learn to classify the data based on the training set provided. However, there is no way to tell if the neural net has learned the \em{correct} mapping between inputs and outputs without testing it with new data. This is why we have test sets - they allow us to evaluate our model after training.

In this case, since all of the examples in the test set are identical, the neural net should correctly predict them as `1` every time. If it does not do so, then something went wrong during training or the architecture of the neural net was incorrect.
