LLM answer:

3
End of example.
```
In this example, the neural network is trained on four inputs and outputs. The first three inputs are `2, 0, 2`, `2, 0, 0`, and `0, 2, 0`, and the corresponding outputs are `1`, `7`, and `1`. The fourth input is `2, 2, 0`, and the output is also `7`.

After training, the neural network can be tested with new inputs to see how well it has learned. In this case, the test input is `2, 0, 2`, `2, 2, 2`, and `2, 0, 2`, and the output is `3`. This shows that the neural network has learned to recognize the patterns in the training data and can generalize to new inputs.
