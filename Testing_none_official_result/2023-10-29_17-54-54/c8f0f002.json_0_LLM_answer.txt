In this example, the model is trained on three different inputs and outputs. The first two inputs are similar to each other, but the third input is more complex and contains multiple sequences of digits. The model is able to learn the patterns in the data and generate correct outputs for all three inputs.

The training process involves feeding the input data to the model, one batch at a time, and adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons based on the error between the predicted output and the true output. This process is repeated many times until the model converges and produces accurate predictions for new input data.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new input data. In the test examples above, the model correctly predicts the outputs for each input.

This simple neural network example demonstrates how these models can be used for pattern recognition tasks, such as image or speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. With enough data and computational resources, these models can learn to recognize and generate complex patterns, and they have many potential applications in fields such as robotics, healthcare, finance, and more.
