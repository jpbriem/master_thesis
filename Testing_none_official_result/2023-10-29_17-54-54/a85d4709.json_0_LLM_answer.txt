In this example, we have a neural network with three inputs and three outputs, and we're training it on four different datasets. Each dataset consists of three input values and one output value. The goal is to learn the relationship between the input values and the output value.

The first dataset is `0, 0, 5`, `0, 5, 0`, and `5, 0, 0`. The second dataset is `0, 0, 5`, `0, 0, 5`, and `5, 0, 0`. The third dataset is `5, 0, 0`, `0, 5, 0`, and `0, 0, 5`. And the fourth dataset is `0, 5, 0`, `0, 0, 5`, and `0, 5, 0`.

We start by feeding each dataset to the neural network, one at a time, and computing the output for each input. We then compare the predicted output with the actual output to see how well the model is doing.

For the first dataset, the predicted output is `3, 3, 3`, which is close to the actual output of `4, 4, 4`. For the second dataset, the predicted output is `4, 4, 4`, which is also close to the actual output of `4, 4, 4`. For the third dataset, the predicted output is `2, 2, 2`, which is not as accurate as the actual output of `3, 3, 3`. And for the fourth dataset, the predicted output is `4, 4, 4`, which is again close to the actual output of `4, 4, 4`.

Overall, the neural network seems to be performing well on these simple datasets. However, it's important to note that these are just simple examples, and in real-world applications, the data may be more complex and difficult to predict.
