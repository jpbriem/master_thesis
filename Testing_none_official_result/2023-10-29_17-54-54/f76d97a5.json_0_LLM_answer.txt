As you can see from the examples above, the neural network is able to learn the pattern of the training data and make correct predictions on new inputs. The learning process is done by adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between the artificial neurons in order to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.

In this simple example, we have used a single hidden layer with two artificial neurons, but more complex networks can have multiple hidden layers and many more artificial neurons. The key idea is that the network learns to recognize patterns in the input data and make predictions based on those patterns.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
