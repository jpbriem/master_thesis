As you can see, the model is able to learn the pattern of the training data and generalize it well to new examples. The test input is a valid sequence of length 5, and the model produces a correct output for it.

Note that this is just a simple example, and in real-world applications, you would need to use more complex models and larger datasets to achieve better performance. Also, the model I used here is a simple feedforward neural network, which may not be the best choice for all tasks. Other types of models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), may be more appropriate for certain tasks.
