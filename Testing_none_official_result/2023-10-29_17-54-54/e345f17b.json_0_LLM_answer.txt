As you can see from the examples above, the neural network is able to learn the pattern of the training data and generate correct outputs for new inputs. However, it's important to note that this is a very simple example and in real-world applications, the data would likely be much more complex and diverse. Additionally, the neural network would need to be trained on a larger dataset to achieve better performance.
