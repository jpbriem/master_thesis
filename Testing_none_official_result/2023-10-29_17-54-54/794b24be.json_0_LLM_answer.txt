As you can see from the examples above, the neural network is able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs, and make correct predictions for new inputs.

It's worth noting that this is a very simple example, and in real-world applications, the neural networks are usually much more complex and have many more layers. Also, the training process is often done using specialized software and hardware, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which greatly accelerate the training process.
