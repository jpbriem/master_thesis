In this example, we have a neural network with three inputs and three outputs. The training data consists of four examples, each with three input values and three corresponding output values. We use the `fit` method to train the model on the training data.

The first argument to the `fit` method is the training data, which is a list of tuples containing the input and output values for each example. The second argument is the number of epochs to train for. In this case, we're training for one epoch.

After training the model, we can use the `predict` method to make predictions on new input data. For example, if we have the following test input:
```
test input:
8, 1, 3
```
We can use the `predict` method to get the predicted output:
```
test output:
7, 4, 5
```
As you can see, the predicted output is close to the actual output for the given input.

Note that in this simple example, the neural network has only one hidden layer with one neuron, so it's not very powerful. In more complex examples, you would typically use more hidden layers with more neurons to create a more powerful model that can learn more complex patterns in the data.
