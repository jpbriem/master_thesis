LLM answer:

4, 4, 4
End of example.
```
In this example, we have a neural network with three inputs and two outputs. The training data consists of four examples, each with three inputs and one output. The first example has the following inputs and outputs:

* Inputs: 0, 0, 0
* Output: 1, 1

The second example has the following inputs and outputs:

* Inputs: 0, 2, 0
* Output: 2, 2

The third example has the following inputs and outputs:

* Inputs: 0, 7, 0
* Output: 7

The fourth example has the following inputs and outputs:

* Inputs: 0, 8, 0
* Output: 8, 8, 8, 8

We then test the network on a single input, which is:

* Inputs: 4, 4, 0

And the expected output is:

* Output: 4, 4, 4

As you can see, the network correctly predicts the output for all the training examples and also correctly classifies the test input. This is because the network has learned to recognize the patterns in the training data and generalize them to new inputs.
