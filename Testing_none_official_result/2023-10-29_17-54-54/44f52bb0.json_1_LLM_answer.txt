LLM answer:

3
End of example.
```
In this example, the neural network is trained on four inputs and outputs. The first three inputs are `2`, `0`, and `2`, and the corresponding outputs are `1`, `1`, and `1`. The fourth input is `0`, `0`, and `0`, and the corresponding output is `3`.

The neural network has one hidden layer with two neurons, and each neuron has a sigmoid activation function. The output layer has one neuron with a linear activation function.

During training, the network is presented with the input vectors, and it produces an output vector. The error between the predicted output and the true output is calculated using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. The weights of the network are adjusted to minimize the MSE loss.

After training, the network can be used to make predictions on new input vectors. In the test case, the input vector is `0`, `0`, and `0`, and the predicted output is `3`.
