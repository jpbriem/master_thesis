As you can see the model is able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs, and generalize well to new examples.

It's worth noting that this is a very simple example, and in real-world scenarios the data would likely be more complex and noisy, and the model would need to be trained on a larger dataset to achieve good performance. Additionally, this is a binary classification problem, but in many cases the target variable could have multiple classes, and the model would need to be modified to handle this.
