In this example, we have a neural network with three inputs and two outputs. The training data consists of four examples, each with three input values and two output values. The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm to adjust the weights and biases in order to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

The first example shows the network being trained on the input `8, 0, 0` and the output `0, 2, 2`. The network's predictions are `0, 2, 2`, which is correct.

The second example shows the network being trained on the input `0, 8, 0` and the output `2, 0, 2`. The network's predictions are `2, 0, 2`, which is correct.

The third example shows the network being trained on the input `5, 0, 0` and the output `0, 4, 4`. The network's predictions are `0, 4, 4`, which is correct.

The fourth example shows the network being trained on the input `5, 5, 5` and the output `0, 0, 0`. The network's predictions are `0, 0, 0`, which is correct.

After training, the network is tested on the input `0, 5, 0` and the output is `0, 4, 4`, which is correct.

This example demonstrates how the backpropagation algorithm can be used to train a neural network to make accurate predictions on new input data.
