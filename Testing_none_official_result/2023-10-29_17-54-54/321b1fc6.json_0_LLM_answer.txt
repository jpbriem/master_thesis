As you can see, the model is able to learn the simple pattern of the training data and generalize it well to new examples. The test input that contains a mix of patterns from the training set and some new ones, the model is able to correctly classify most of them.
It's worth noting that this is a very basic example, and in real-world scenarios, the data would likely be more complex and diverse, and the model would need to be trained on a larger dataset to achieve better performance. Additionally, the model could be improved by adding more features or using different architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
