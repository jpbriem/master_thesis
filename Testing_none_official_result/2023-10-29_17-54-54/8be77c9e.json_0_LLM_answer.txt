In this example, the neural network is trained on three inputs and outputs. The training data consists of four examples, each with three inputs and one output. The network is trained to predict the output based on the inputs.

The first two examples are easy for the network to learn, as the inputs and outputs are highly correlated. The third example is more challenging, as the input values are not as clearly related to the output value. However, the network is able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs and make accurate predictions.

After training, the network is tested on a new set of input-output pairs. The test data consists of five examples, each with three inputs and one output. The network is able to accurately predict the outputs for all five examples, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new data.
