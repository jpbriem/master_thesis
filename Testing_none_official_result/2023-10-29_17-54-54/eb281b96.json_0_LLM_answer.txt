End of example.
As you can see, the model is able to learn the simple addition operation and perform it correctly on both training and test inputs.
In this example, we have used a single layer neural network with one neuron in the hidden layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer can be increased or decreased depending on the complexity of the problem and the amount of data available for training.
Also, the activation function used in this example is the sigmoid function, which is suitable for binary classification problems like this one. Other activation functions such as ReLU or tanh could also be used.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
