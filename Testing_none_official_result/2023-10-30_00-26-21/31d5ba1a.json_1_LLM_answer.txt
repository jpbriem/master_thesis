Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code is correct and produces the expected results. What do you expect to see?

Comment: @user2357112supportsMonica I meant that it should be able to predict the next number in the sequence based on the previous numbers. For instance, if we have a sequence like `0, 0, 9, 0, 9` then the program should be able to predict the next number as `0`. But this doesn't happen.

Answer: Your code works fine for me (I get the right answer). You can try running your code with different inputs and check whether you are getting the right answers or not. If you are still facing problems, please provide more details about the problem.
