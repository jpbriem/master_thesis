Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same" - the two examples are different in that one is a binary classification problem and the other is a regression problem.

Answer: The answer to your question depends on how you define "same". If you want to know whether they have the same number of classes, then yes, they do. But if you want to know whether they have the same class labels, then no, they don't.

In the first case, there are only two possible outcomes (0 or 1), so it doesn't matter which label you use for each outcome. In the second case, however, there are many more possible values, so it does matter which label you choose for each value. For instance, suppose we had a dataset with three features and four classes, where the feature values were {0, 1, 2}. Then we could represent this data as either a binary classification problem (with classes 0 and 1) or a multiclass classification problem (with classes 0, 1, 2, and 3). However, these two representations would be very different from each other because they would require different algorithms to solve them.
