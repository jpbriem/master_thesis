Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training set". The training set is a collection of examples that are used to learn the model. Once it has been learned, we can use it on new data (i.e., the testing set). If your model is good enough, then the predictions should be similar for both sets.

Answer: You need to understand how neural networks work in order to answer this question.

The network learns from the training dataset and tries to find patterns therein. It does so by adjusting its weights until it finds a pattern which minimizes the loss function. This means that if you have two different datasets with different distributions, they will probably result in different models.

However, if you have two datasets with the same distribution, but one is larger than the other, the smaller one might still result in a better model because the network has more time to explore the space.
