Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training set". The training set is a collection of examples that are used to learn the model. Once it has been learned, we can use it on new data (i.e., the testing set). If your model is good enough, then the predictions should be similar to the actual values in the testing set.

Answer: You need to make sure that the network is trained with the same number of neurons and layers as the one you want to predict with.

If you have a network with 1 hidden layer with 6 neurons, you will need to train another network with 1 hidden layer with 6 neurons.
