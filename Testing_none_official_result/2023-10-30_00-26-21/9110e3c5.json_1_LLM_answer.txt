Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code in your question is different from the one in your comment.

Comment: @user2357112supportsMonica I meant that the results are the same for both codes.

Answer: \section{The problem with `for` loops and `while` loops}

In Python, there is a difference between `for` loops and `while` loops. In particular, when using a `for` loop, the variable being iterated over will be assigned to at each iteration. This means that if you have two variables which share the same name, they will overwrite each other. For example:

\begin{code}
a = [1] * 10
b = [2] * 10

for i in range(len(a)):
    print(i)

# Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

for j in range(len(b)):
    print(j)

# Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
\end{code}

This can cause problems because it makes it difficult to debug. If you want to use a `for` loop, make sure that all of the variables used inside of the loop are unique.

On the other hand, `while` loops do not assign values to their variables. Instead, they just check whether or not the condition is true. As such, they don't interfere with each other.

\section{Using `while` loops instead of `for` loops}

As mentioned above, `while` loops do not assign values to their variables. Because of this, they won't interfere with each other. However, they also require more work on our part. We need to manually increment the index every time we iterate through the list.

For example:

\begin{code}
def get_indexes(input_list):
    indexes = []
    while len(input_list) > 0:
        current_index = len(input_list) - 1
        indexes.append(current_index)
        input_list[current_index] = 0
        input_list.pop()
    return indexes
\end{code}

Note how we had to add an extra line (`input_list[current_index] = 0`) so that we could remove the last element of the list.

\section{Using `enumerate()`}

Another option would be to use [`enumerate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-enumerate). It returns a tuple containing the index and value of the current item.

\begin{code}
def get_indexes(input_list):
    indexes = []
    for index, value in enumerate(input_list):
        if value == 0:
            break
        else:
            indexes.append(index)
            input_list[index] = 0
    return indexes
\end{code}
