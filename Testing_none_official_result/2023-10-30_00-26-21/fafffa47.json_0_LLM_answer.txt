Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code is correct and it produces the expected results. What do you expect?

Comment: @user3487650 I think he means that the program should be able to predict the next number in a sequence based on the previous numbers. For instance, if we have `0, 0, 0` as our first three inputs, then the program should return `0`. If we have `0, 0, 1`, then the program should return `0`. And so on...

I am trying to write a simple neural network for my homework assignment.

You are doing this wrong. You need to use a library like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [Keras](http://keras.io/).

The reason why you can't just implement your own neural network from scratch is because there are many things that you don't know about (like how to initialize weights).

If you want to learn more about machine learning, I recommend reading [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Recipes-Second-Edition/dp/149195449X) which teaches you how to build machine learning models using TensorFlow.
