Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training set". The training set is a list of pairs (inputs, outputs). What do you want to compare it with?

Comment: @user1057270 Sorry for my bad explanation. I meant that if we have two different sets of inputs and outputs, then they should be equal. For example, in this case, the first set of inputs and outputs are the same as the second one.

Answer: You can use `np.testing.assert_allclose` from numpy. It will check whether all elements of two arrays are close to each other within some tolerance.

For your example, it would look like this:

\begin{code}
import numpy as np

def test():
    #...
    assert_allclose(train_output, test_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()
\end{code}
