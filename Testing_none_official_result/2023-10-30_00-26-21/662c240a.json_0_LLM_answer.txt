Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training set". The training set is a list of tuples (inputs, outputs). What do you want to compare it with?

Comment: @user202729 I meant that the network should be able to predict the correct output for any given input in the training set.

Answer: You can use `np.testing.assert_allclose` from numpy. It will check if two arrays are equal up to some tolerance. In your case, you need to define the tolerance yourself. For example, if you have an array `x`, and you want to know how close it is to another array `y`:

\begin{code}
import numpy as np

def assert_almost_equal(x, y):
    # Define the tolerance here
    eps = 1e-10
    assert_allclose(x, y, rtol=eps)
\end{code}
