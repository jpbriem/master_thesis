Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code is correct and it produces the expected results. What do you expect?

Comment: @user3489756 I think he means that the program should be able to predict the next number in a sequence based on the previous numbers. For instance, if we have `0, 1, 0` as an input, then the program should return `0, 2, 0`. If we have `1, 0, 1`, then the program should return `2, 0, 2`.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I am trying to write a simple neural network for my homework assignment but I can't seem to get it right.
\end{blockquote}

Your code looks fine. It seems like your problem lies elsewhere.

\begin{blockquote}

The code below is supposed to take two inputs (x1, x2) and one output (y). Then it will calculate the error between y and the output from the network.
\end{blockquote}

This part is also fine. You are calculating the error correctly.

\begin{blockquote}

Then it will update the weights using backpropagation.
\end{blockquote}

You are doing this incorrectly. Backpropagation requires you to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight. This is done by taking the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight. In other words, you need to use the chain rule.

For example, suppose you want to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the first weight. Let's say the loss function is defined as follows:
$$L(w_1, w_2, b) = \frac{1}{2}(y - f(x; w_1, w_2, b))^2$$
where $f$ is some function that takes three parameters ($w_1$, $w_2$, and $b$) and returns a value. We know that the gradient of $L$ with respect to $w_1$ is given by:
$$\nabla_{w_1} L = \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}$$
We can compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}$ by applying the chain rule. First, let's define $g(x)$ such that $g(x) = f(x; w_1 + \Delta w_1, w_2, b)$. Then, we have:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial g}\cdot\frac{\partial g}{\partial w_1}$$
Now, we can compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial g}$. Since $g$ depends only on $w_1$ and $w_2$, we have:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial g} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\cdot\frac{\partial y}{\partial g}$$
Finally, we can compute $\frac{\partial g}{\partial w_1}$. Recall that $g(x) = f(x; w_1 + \Delta w_1, w_2, b)$, so we have:
$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial w_1} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial w_1}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial w_2}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial b}$$
Putting everything together, we obtain:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\cdot\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial w_1}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial w_2}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial b}\right)$$
In general, you would repeat this process for all of the weights. However, since you are updating the weights at once, you don't actually need to compute the gradients individually. Instead, you can just multiply them together. So, instead of computing $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}$, you could simply compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial w_1}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial w_2}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial b}$.
