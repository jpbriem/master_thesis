Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training set". The training set is a collection of examples that are used to learn the model. Once it has been learned, we can use it on new data (i.e., the testing set). If your model is good enough, then the predictions should be similar to the actual values in the testing set.

Answer: You need to make sure that the network is trained with the same number of samples per class as there are classes in the test set. For instance if you have three classes and only two samples for each class during training, the network will predict one of these two samples when presented with an unseen sample from this class.
