Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same" - do you want to know how many times each number appears in the training set? Or are you asking for a way to count the number of times that each number occurs in both sets?

Comment: @JonathanLeffler I am trying to find out if there is any difference between the two sets. So yes, I would like to know how many times each number appears in the training set and also in the testing set.

Answer: You can use `set`s to get the unique values from your lists, then compare them using `set.intersection()`:

\begin{code}
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import random
>>> n = 10000
>>> x_train = [random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(n)]
>>> y_train = [random.choice([0, 1]) for _ in range(n)]
>>> x_test = [random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(n)]
>>> y_test = [random.choice([0, 1]) for _ in range(n)]
>>> print('Train data')
>>> print(x_train)
