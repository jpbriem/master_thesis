Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code is correct and it does exactly what it should do. What are you expecting?

Comment: @user1594172 I think he means that the results are different from his own implementation.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I am trying to implement a neural network in C++ using backpropagation algorithm.
\end{blockquote}

You don't need to use back-propagation for this problem. You can just use gradient descent with an initial guess of zero weights (or random weights).

\begin{blockquote}

But when I run my program, I get different results than expected.
\end{blockquote}

Your code looks fine. It seems like your expectations are wrong.

\begin{blockquote}

Can anyone tell me where I went wrong?
\end{blockquote}

It doesn't look like there's anything wrong with your code. Your expectations seem to be incorrect.
