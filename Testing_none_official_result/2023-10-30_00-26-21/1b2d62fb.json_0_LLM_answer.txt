Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code is correct and it produces the expected results. What do you expect?

Comment: @user2357112supportsMonica I think he means that the program should be able to predict the next number in a sequence based on previous numbers. For instance, if we have `0, 0, 0` as an input, then the program should return `0`. If we have `0, 0, 0, 1`, then the program should return `0`. And so on...

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to write a program which can guess the next number in a given sequence.

That sounds like a good idea for a project! But your current implementation doesn’t work very well. It seems to me that there are two problems with it:
\begin{itemize}
\item You don’t seem to understand how to use `for` loops. In particular, you need to put the loop body inside the parentheses; otherwise, Python will just ignore everything after the colon.
\item Your algorithm isn’t very good. As written, it only works correctly when the first three inputs are all zeroes. That’s because you’re using the last element of the list as the index into the training data, but you never update that value. So if the first three elements aren’t all zeros, then the fourth one won’t match any of the training examples, and the program will always guess wrong.
\end{itemize}

Here’s some sample output from your program:

\begin{code}
train input:
0, 0, 0, 1, 9, 0, 0
9, 0, 0, 1, 9, 9, 9
0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9
0, 0, 0, 1, 9, 9, 9
0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9
train output:
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
End of example.
train input:
0, 0, 0, 1, 9, 0, 0
9, 0, 0, 1, 9, 9, 9

0, 0, 0, 1, 9, 9, 9
0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9
train output:
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0

9, 0, 0, 1, 9, 0, 0
