Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The first two examples are the same, but they have different outputs.

Comment: @user253751 Yes, that is correct. But if we look at the last three examples, they all have the same inputs and outputs. So it seems like there is a pattern in the training data which can be used to predict the output for any given input.

Answer: This is an instance of [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning). You need to find some way to represent your problem as a supervised learning task. For example, you could use a neural network with one hidden layer (or more) to learn the mapping from input to output. Or you could try to find a function $f$ such that $f(x)$ approximates the desired output.

In general, this will require some kind of loss function to measure how well the approximation matches the actual output. In your case, you might want to minimize the sum of squared differences between the predicted output and the actual output.
