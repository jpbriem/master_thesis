Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The first two examples are the same, but they have different outputs.

Comment: @user3489756 Sorry for that, I meant to say that the network is able to learn from the training data and generalize it on the testing data.

Answer: You can use a [validation set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) (or cross validation) to check if your model overfits or underfits.

You split your dataset into three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Training set
\item Validation set
\item Testing set
\end{itemize}

Then you train your model with the training set and evaluate its performance using the validation set. If the accuracy is high enough, then you can be confident that your model does not overfit. Otherwise, you should increase the number of layers in your neural network.
