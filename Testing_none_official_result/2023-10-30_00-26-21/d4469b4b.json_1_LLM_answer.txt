Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code is correct and produces the expected results. What do you expect?

Comment: @user463035818 I have edited my question to explain it better.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to understand why this code works as intended but when I try to change a few lines in order to make it work for other cases (like the one described above) it doesn't work anymore.
\end{blockquote}

The problem is that your `if` statement is wrong. You are checking if `x == y`, which will always be false because `x` and `y` are different variables. Instead, you should check if `x[i] == y[j]`.

Here is an updated version of your code with these changes:

\begin{code}
def get_output(input):
    # Get the number of rows and columns from the input matrix
    n = len(input)
    m = len(input[0])

    # Create the output matrix
    output = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]

    # For each row i in the input matrix, find the column j such that x[i][j]!= 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if input[i][j]!= 0:
                break
        else:
            continue

        # Set all elements in the output matrix equal to 5 except those at position [i][j], which we set to 0
        for k in range(n):
            for l in range(m):
                if k!= i or l!= j:
                    output[k][l] = 5
                else:
                    output[k][l] = 0

    return output
\end{code}
