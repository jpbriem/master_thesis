Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code in your question is different from the code in your comment. In particular, it doesn't use `np.random.randint` to generate the training data.

Answer: You can do this with a simple loop over all possible values for each class and then calculate the accuracy on that set of examples. For instance, if there are two classes (A and B) and three features (x1, x2, x3), you could do something like this:

\begin{code}
import numpy as np
from sklearn import metrics

# Create some random data
n_samples = 500
X = np.random.rand(n_samples, 3)
y = np.random.choice([0, 1], n_samples)

# Calculate accuracy on each combination of y and X
accuracies = []
for i in range(len(y)):
    # Get current value of y
    yi = y[i]
    # Get current value of X
    xi = X[i]
    # Predict using model
    pred = model.predict(xi)
    # Check prediction against actual label
    accuracies.append(metrics.accuracy_score(yi, pred))
print('Accuracy on each combination of y and X:', accuracies)
\end{code}
