Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The two inputs are identical except for the last digit. The outputs are also identical except for the last digit.

I think this is a good fit for a neural network. You can use a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer and sigmoid activation function.

The number of neurons in the hidden layer should be equal to the number of features in your data. In this case, it would be 5.

You can use scikit-learn library to implement this model. Here is an example code snippet:

```
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create the neural network model
clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(5), max_iter=1000, solver='adam', verbose=0)

# Train the model using the training set
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy: {:.2f}%'.format(accuracy * 100))
```

Note that you need to preprocess your data before feeding it into the neural network. For example, you may want to normalize or standardize your data.
