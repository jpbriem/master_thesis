Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same inputs and outputs". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesBrown I have added an example to my question. The test inputs are different from the train inputs but they should produce the same output.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good fit for a neural network. You can use a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.

The number of neurons in the hidden layer will depend on how many features you want to learn. If you only want to learn the linear relationship between the inputs and outputs then you could start with just one neuron in the hidden layer.

You may also need to normalize your data before training the neural network.

Here is some sample code using TensorFlow:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Normalize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

Solution:
9, 5, 4
9, 5, 4
9, 5, 4
