Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same inputs and outputs". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @MichaelHampton The first two examples have the same inputs and outputs. The third example has different inputs but the same outputs as the first two. The fourth example has different inputs and outputs than all three previous examples.

## Answer (1)

The problem is that your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using a smaller number of hidden units or regularization techniques such as L2 regularization.

You could also try using a different activation function for the hidden layer. For example, you might try using ReLU instead of sigmoid.
