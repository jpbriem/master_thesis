Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two inputs and outputs are identical to the third set of inputs and outputs.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good fit for a neural network with one hidden layer. You can use a sigmoid activation function in the hidden layer and a linear activation function in the output layer.

The number of neurons in the hidden layer should be determined based on your data. For example, if you have many features in your input, then you may want more neurons in the hidden layer. If you have few features, then fewer neurons may suffice.

You can also try using different activation functions in the hidden layer such as ReLU or tanh.

Here is some sample code that uses scikit-learn to implement a neural network with one hidden layer:

```
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create neural network model
clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50), max_iter=1000, solver='adam', verbose=0)

# Train model on training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on testing data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
```
