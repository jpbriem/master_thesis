Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the second one.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your `train_output` variable is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop. You should move it outside of the loop.

Also, you can simplify your code with numpy arrays.

Here is an example:

```
import numpy as np

def train(X, y):
    n = len(y)
    X_train = np.zeros((n, 2))
    y_train = np.zeros((n, 1))
    for i in range(n):
        X_train[i] = [X[i][0], X[i][1]]
        y_train[i] = y[i]
    return X_train, y_train

def predict(X_train, y_train):
    n = len(y_train)
    y_pred = np.zeros((n, 1))
    for i in range(n):
        if X_train[i][0] == 0 and X_train[i][1] == 0:
            y_pred[i] = 0
        elif X_train[i][0] == 0 and X_train[i][1] == 1:
            y_pred[i] = 1
        elif X_train[i][0] == 1 and X_train[i][1] == 0:
            y_pred[i] = 1
        else: # X_train[i][0] == 1 and X_train[i][1] == 1
            y_pred[i] = 0
    return y_pred
```

You can then call these functions like so:

```
X = [[0, 0], [5, 2], [5, 2], [0, 0], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [0, 0], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2], [5,
