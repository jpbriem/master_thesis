Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the second one. The fourth one has a different input and output than all three previous ones.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L2 or dropout to prevent overfitting. Also, you might want to check if your model is underfitted by checking the loss on the validation set. If it is underfitted, you may need to increase the number of layers/neurons in your model.
