Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two inputs and outputs are identical in both cases.

## Answer (1)

The problem is that you are using `np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]])` as your training data. This means that you have only one sample for each class. In order to train a model, you need at least two samples per class.

You can either add more samples or use a different algorithm such as k-nearest neighbors.
