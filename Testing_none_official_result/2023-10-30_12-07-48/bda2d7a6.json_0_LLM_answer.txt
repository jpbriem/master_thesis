Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the second one.

## Answer (4)

The problem is that your `predict_output` function does not return anything. You need to add a return statement at the end of it.

Also, in your `predict_output` function, you are using `return` statements inside loops. This will cause an infinite loop because each time you call `predict_output`, it will keep calling itself until it reaches the point where it calls itself again.

You can fix this by returning the final result from the `predict_output` function instead of returning the intermediate results.

Here is how you could modify your code to do this:

```
def predict_output(input):
    #...
    if len(output) == 1:
        return output[0]
    else:
        return sum([predict_output(x) for x in output])
```

Note that I also removed the `return` statements inside the loops.

Comment: Thanks! That was exactly my mistake.
