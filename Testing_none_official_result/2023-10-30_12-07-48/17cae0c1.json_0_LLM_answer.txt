Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third example has a different input but the same output as the first two. The fourth example has a different input and output than all three previous examples.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization.

You can also try using cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.
