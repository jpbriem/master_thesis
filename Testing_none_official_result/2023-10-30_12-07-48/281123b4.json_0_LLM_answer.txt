Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same as the training data". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two sets of test inputs and outputs are identical to the corresponding sets in the training data. The last two sets are different.

## Answer (1)

I think that your model is overfitting on the training set. You can try using a smaller number of hidden units or regularization techniques such as L2 regularization.

You could also try using a different activation function for the hidden layer. For example, you might try using ReLU instead of sigmoid.

Comment: Thanks for the answer! I tried with ReLU but it didn't help much. I will try reducing the number of hidden units.
