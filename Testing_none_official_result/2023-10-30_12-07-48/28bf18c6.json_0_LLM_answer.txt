Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the first two.

## Answer (4)

The problem is that your `train_output` variable is a list of tuples, while your `test_output` variable is a list of integers. You can fix this by converting your `train_output` to a list of integers before comparing it with `test_output`.

Here's an example of how you could do this:

```
import numpy as np

# Convert train_output to list of integers
train_output = [int(x[0]) for x in train_output]

# Compare test_output with train_output
assert test_output == train_output
```

Note that this assumes that each tuple in `train_output` contains only one integer value. If there are multiple values in each tuple, you may need to modify the conversion accordingly.

Solution:
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
