Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

## Answer (3)

You can use `apply()` to apply a function to each row in your data frame and then `group_by()` to group them by their class. Then you can use `summarise()` to summarize the values for each group.

Here is an example code snippet that should do what you want:

```
library(dplyr)

df %>%
  mutate(class = factor(class)) %>% # convert class column to factor
  group_by(class) %>%
  summarise(mean_value = mean(value))
```

This will give you a table with one row per class containing the mean value for that class.

If you want to get rid of the class column from the result, you can simply remove it using `select(-class)`.

Comment: Thanks! This works great. Just one question - how would I go about doing this if my classes were numeric instead of factors?

Comment: @user590077 You could replace `factor(class)` with `as.numeric(class)` or `as.integer(class)`, depending on whether you want to treat the class as integers or factors.
