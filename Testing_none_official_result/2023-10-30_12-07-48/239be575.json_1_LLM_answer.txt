Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @MichaelHampton The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different output.

## Answer (1)

The problem is that your `train_output` variable is being updated in each iteration of the loop. You need to move it outside the loop so that it only gets updated once per epoch.

Also, you should be using `np.random.randint(low=0, high=num_classes, size=batch_size)` instead of `np.random.randint(low=0, high=num_classes+1, size=batch_size)`. This will ensure that you don't get any values greater than or equal to `num_classes`, which can cause problems when trying to predict classes with indexes greater than or equal to `num_classes`.
