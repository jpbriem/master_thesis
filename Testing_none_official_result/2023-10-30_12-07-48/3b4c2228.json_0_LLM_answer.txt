Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output. The fourth one has a different input and output. The fifth one has the same input as the second example but a different output. The sixth one has the same input as the third example but a different output. The seventh one has the same input as the fourth example but a different output. The eighth one has the same input as the fifth example but a different output. The ninth one has the same input as the sixth example but a different output. The tenth one has the same input as the seventh example but a different output.

## Answer (4)

The problem is that your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization.

You can also try using cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.

Comment: Thanks for the answer! I tried adding L1 regularization with alpha = 0.01 and it didn't help much. I also tried using k-fold cross validation with k=5 and it didn't help much either. Do you have any other suggestions?
