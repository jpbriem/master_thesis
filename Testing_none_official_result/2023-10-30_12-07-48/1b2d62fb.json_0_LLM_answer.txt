Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

## Answer (2)

The problem is that you are using `np.array()` to convert your numpy array into a tensor. This will create a new tensor with the same data as the numpy array but with different memory location. The original numpy array is then destroyed and can no longer be used for further operations.

You should use `tf.convert_to_tensor(numpy_array)` instead.

Here is an example:

```
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Create numpy array
x = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(3, 4))
y = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(3, 4))

# Convert numpy arrays to tensors
x_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(x)
y_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(y)

print(x)
print(y)
print(x_tensor)
print(y_tensor)
```

Output:

```
[[5 7 6 8]
 [8 9 7 6]
 [6 5 8 7]]
 [[9 8 7 6]
 [6 5 8 7]
 [7 8 9 6]]
 Tensor("input_1/Const:0", shape=(3, 4), dtype=int32)
 Tensor("input_2/Const:0", shape=(3, 4), dtype=int32)
```

As you can see, the numpy arrays are still present in memory after converting them to tensors.
