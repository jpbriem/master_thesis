Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third example has a different input but the same output as the first two. The fourth example has a different input and output than the previous three.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization. Also, you may want to use cross-validation to check if your model is overfitting.
