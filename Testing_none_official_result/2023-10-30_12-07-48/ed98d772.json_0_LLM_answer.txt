Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your `train_output` variable is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop. You should use `append()` instead of `+=`.

Also, it seems like you want to predict the next value based on the previous values. In that case, you need to change your model architecture. Currently, you are using a simple linear regression model which does not take into account any dependencies between the inputs.

You could try something like this:

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def predict(inputs):
    # TODO: implement your prediction logic here
    pass

# Example usage
data = [
    [1, 2],
    [2, 4],
    [3, 6]
]

model = LinearRegression()
for i in range(len(data)):
    x = data[i][0]
    y = data[i][1]
    model.fit([x], [y])
    print("Predicted:", predict([x]))
```

This will fit a linear regression model for each pair of inputs and then use those models to make predictions for new inputs. Note that this approach may not be very accurate if there are many possible combinations of inputs.
