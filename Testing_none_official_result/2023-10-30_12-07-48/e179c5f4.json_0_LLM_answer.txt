Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesBrown The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the first two.

## Answer (2)

I think this is because your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization.

You can also try using cross-validation to see if it helps with overfitting.

Comment: Thanks for the answer! I tried adding l1 and l2 regularization but it didn't help much. I will try cross validation next.
