Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @MichaelHampton The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the second one.

## Answer (2)

The problem is that your `train_output` variable is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop. You need to append it instead.

```
def train(X_train, y_train):
    train_output = []
    for i in range(len(y_train)):
        X_train_input = np.array([[X_train[i][0], X_train[i][1]]])
        X_train_output = np.array([y_train[i]])
        train_output.append(X_train_output)
    return train_output
```

Solution:
7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7
0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0
0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0
