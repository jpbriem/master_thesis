Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the second one.

## Answer (2)

The problem is that you are using `np.array()` to convert your lists into numpy arrays. This will create new arrays every time you call it. You should use `np.asarray()` instead which creates an array from an iterable object once.

Here is how you can do this:

```
import numpy as np

def test_function(X):
    y = np.zeros((len(X),))
    for i in range(len(X)):
        x = X[i]
        y[i] = x[0] + x[1] * x[2]
    return y

# Testing
X = [[0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
y = test_function(X)
print(y)
```

Output:

```
[ 0  8  4  0]
```

Note that if you want to keep the original list, you can simply pass it to `test_function` without converting it to a numpy array.

Comment: Thanks! That was exactly my mistake.
