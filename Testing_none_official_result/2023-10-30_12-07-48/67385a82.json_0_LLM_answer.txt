Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output. The fourth one has a different input and output. The fifth one has the same input as the second example but a different output.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization. Also, you may want to use cross-validation to check if your model is overfitting.
