Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different output for the same input.

## Answer (1)

The problem is that your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L2 or dropout to prevent this.

Also, it seems like you are using `np.random.randint(low=0, high=1, size=(batch_size,))` instead of `np.random.randint(low=0, high=1, size=(batch_size,))`. This will result in all values being either 0 or 1 which is not valid for binary classification.

You should also check if your model architecture is appropriate for the task at hand. For example, a simple neural network with only one hidden layer may not be sufficient for more complex problems.
