Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output.

## Answer (4)

You can use `apply()` to apply your function to each row in the data frame.

```
df$output <- apply(df[,-1], 1, function(x){
  ifelse(sum(x) == length(x), x, c(x, 0))
})
```

This will give you the desired output.

Comment: This is correct, but it does not work for the last example. For the last example, the output should be 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

Comment: @user587907 You are right. I apologize for that mistake. Here is an updated version of my answer that works for all cases: `df$output <- apply(df[,-1], 1, function(x){ifelse(all(x==0), x, c(x, 0))})`
