Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples are the same as the last two examples.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good solution for your problem:

```
def predict(X):
    # Get the number of features in X
    n_features = X.shape[1]

    # Create an empty array to store the predictions
    y_pred = np.zeros((len(X), n_features))

    # Loop through each row in X
    for i in range(len(X)):
        # Get the current row from X
        x_row = X[i, :]

        # Use the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to find the nearest k rows in X
        k_neighbors = np.argsort(np.linalg.norm(x_row - X, axis=1))[:k+1][::-1]

        # For each neighbor, calculate the weighted average of their values
        weights = 1 / k
        for j in k_neighbors:
            if j!= i:
                y_pred[i, :] += weights * X[j, :]

        # Normalize the predicted values so they sum up to 1
        y_pred[i, :] /= np.sum(y_pred[i, :])

    return y_pred
```

This function takes in a numpy array `X`, which should have shape `(n_samples, n_features)`. It then loops through each row in `X`, finds the `k` nearest neighbors using the Euclidean distance metric, and calculates the weighted average of their values. Finally, it normalizes the predicted values so that they sum up to 1.

Note that this implementation assumes that all samples have the same number of features. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
