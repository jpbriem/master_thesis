Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same output and the last two examples have the same output.

## Answer (0)

I think this is a good solution for your problem:

```
def generate_output(input):
    output = []
    for i in range(len(input)):
        if input[i] == 1:
            output.append(1)
        else:
            output.append(0)
    return output
```

This function takes an integer list as input and returns a new list with the same values but with all 1s replaced by 0s.
