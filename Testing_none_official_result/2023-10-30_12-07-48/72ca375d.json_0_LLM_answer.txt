Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples in your answer are identical to the first two examples in my question. The third and fourth examples in your answer are also identical to the third and fourth examples in my question.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good fit for a neural network. You can use a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.

The number of neurons in the hidden layer will depend on how many features you have in your data. For example if you have 10 features then you could try something like 5-10 neurons in the hidden layer.

You can use any activation function that works well for classification problems such as sigmoid or ReLU.

Here is some sample code using Keras:

```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# define model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=10,input_dim=10,activation='relu')) # add dense layer with 10 units
model.add(Dense(units=1,activation='sigmoid')) # add dense layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation

# compile model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',optimizer='adam',metrics=['accuracy'])

# fit model
model.fit(X_train,y_train,epochs=100,batch_size=32)

# make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

Note that this is just an example and you may need to adjust the architecture of the model depending on your specific problem.
