Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the second one.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your `train_output` variable is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop. You should use `append` instead of `+=`.

Also, it seems like you want to predict the next value in the sequence based on the previous values. In that case, you need to change your model architecture. Currently, you are using a linear regression model which will only give you a single output for each input. If you want to predict the next value in the sequence, you would need to use a recurrent neural network (RNN).
