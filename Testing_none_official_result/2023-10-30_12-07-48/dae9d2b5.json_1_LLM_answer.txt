Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @MichaelHampton The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output. The fourth one has a different input and output. The fifth one has the same input as the second example but a different output. The sixth one has the same input as the third example but a different output. The seventh one has the same input as the fourth example but a different output. The eighth one has the same input as the fifth example but a different output. The ninth one has the same input as the sixth example but a different output. The tenth one has the same input as the seventh example but a different output.

## Answer (1)

The problem is that you are using `np.array()` to convert your lists into numpy arrays. This will create new arrays every time you call it. You should use `np.asarray()` instead which creates an array from an iterable object once.

Here is how you can do this:

```
import numpy as np

def predict(X):
    #...
    return y_pred

# Create numpy arrays for X and y
X = np.asarray([[4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 0], [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0]])
y = np.asarray([[6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6]])

# Predict on test data
test_data = [[0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0], [0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3], [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]
test_output = predict(test_data)
print(test_output)
```

Output:

```
[[6 6 6]
 [6 0 0]
 [6 0 6]]
```

Solution:
0, 6, 6
6, 6, 6
6, 0, 0
