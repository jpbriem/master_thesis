Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples in your answer are identical to the first two examples in my question.

## Answer (3)

I think this is a good solution for your problem:

```
def predict(X):
    # Get the number of features and samples
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    n_samples = X.shape[0]

    # Create an empty array to store the predictions
    y_pred = np.zeros((n_samples, n_classes))

    # Loop through each sample
    for i in range(n_samples):
        # Get the current sample
        x_i = X[i, :]

        # Find the index of the maximum value in the current sample
        max_index = np.argmax(x_i)

        # Set the prediction for the current sample to be equal to the class label corresponding to the index of the maximum value
        y_pred[i] = classes_[max_index]

    return y_pred
```

This function takes as input an array `X` with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, where `n_samples` is the number of samples and `n_features` is the number of features. It returns an array `y_pred` with shape `(n_samples, n_classes)`, where `n_classes` is the number of classes.

The function loops through each sample in `X`. For each sample, it finds the index of the maximum value using `np.argmax()`. Then, it sets the prediction for that sample to be equal to the class label corresponding to the index of the maximum value using `classes_`.

Note that this function assumes that the class labels are stored in the variable `classes_`. If they are stored elsewhere, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
