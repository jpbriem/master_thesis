Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same as the training data". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The test and train inputs are the same. The outputs are different.

## Answer (0)

I think that your model is overfitting to the training set. You can try using a regularization technique such as L1 or L2 regularization. Also, you may want to use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.
