Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your `train_output` variable is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop. You should use `append()` instead of `+=`.

Also, it seems like you want to predict the next value based on the previous values. In that case, you need to change your model architecture. Currently, you are using a feedforward neural network with no recurrent layers. This means that the network does not remember any information about the past inputs. To make it work for your problem, you would need to add some sort of memory mechanism such as LSTM or GRU.
