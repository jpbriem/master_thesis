Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the second one. And so on...

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your `train_output` variable is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop. You should move it outside of the loop.

Also, you can simplify your code with some list comprehensions:

```
def train(X, y):
    n = len(y)
    for i in range(n):
        X_train, y_train = X[i], y[i]
        X_test, y_test = X[(i+1)%n], y[(i+1)%n]
        if np.sum(np.array([x == y_train for x in X_test])) == 1:
            train_output += 1
        else:
            train_output -= 1
    return train_output / n
```
