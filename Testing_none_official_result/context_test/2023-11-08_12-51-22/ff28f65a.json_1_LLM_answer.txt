LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The input and output grids are represented as 2D arrays of integers, where each integer value represents a color. The goal is to find the simplest possible relation between the input and output grids, which can be described using the provided fields.

The reflection field should contain a brief description of the relation between the input and output grids, highlighting any notable patterns or features.

The grid_changes field should describe whether the dimensions of the input and output grids are the same or different, and if different, how they differ (e.g., one grid is larger than the other in certain directions).

The pixel_changes field should focus on the movements or pattern changes between corresponding pixels in the input and output grids. It should describe how the pixels change, such as shifting, scaling, or flipping.

The object_changes field should focus on the changes between objects (regions of similar color) in the input and output grids. It should describe the changes in object number, size, shape, position, value, and cell count.

The overall_pattern field should describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs, considering the transformations observed in the training data.

The instructions field should provide detailed step-by-step instructions for transforming an input grid into an output grid, using the observed transformations in the training data.

Finally, the test_output field should contain the resulting output grid when applying the instructions to the test input grid.
