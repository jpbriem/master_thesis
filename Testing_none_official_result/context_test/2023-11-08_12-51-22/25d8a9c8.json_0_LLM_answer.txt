LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

This is an interesting problem! It seems like you want me to analyze a set of input-output pairs and figure out the simplest possible relation between them. Then, you want me to use that information to transform a test input grid and produce a test output grid.

To start, let's take a look at the train input and output pairs you provided:

| Train Input | Train Output |
| --- | --- |
| 4, 4, 4 | 5, 5, 5 |
| 2, 3, 2 | 0, 0, 0 |
| 2, 3, 3 | 0, 0, 0 |
| 7, 3, 3 | 0, 0, 0 |
| 6, 6, 6 | 5, 5, 5 |
| 3, 7, 7 | 0, 0, 0 |
| 2, 9, 2 | 0, 0, 0 |
| 4, 4, 4 | 5, 5, 5 |
| 1, 1, 1 | 5, 5, 5 |

From these examples, I can see that the input and output grids have the same dimensions (4x4, 3x3, etc.). The outputs seem to be derived from the inputs by applying some kind of transformation, such as rotation, reflection, or scaling.

Based on this observation, my hypothesis is that the simplest possible relation between the input and output is a transformation that takes the input grid and produces the output grid through a sequence of geometric operations (rotation, reflection, scaling, translation).

Now, let's move on to the test input grid:

| Test Input |
| --- |
| 4, 4, 4 |
| 3, 2, 3 |
| 8, 8, 8 |

Using my hypothesis, I would suggest the following transformation to convert the test input grid into the test output grid:

1. Rotate the input grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
2. Reflect the rotated grid horizontally.
3. Scale the reflected grid upward by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
4. Translate the scaled grid upward by 2 rows and leftward by 2 columns.

Here's what the transformed grid would look like:

| Test Output |
| --- |
| 5, 5, 5 |
| 0, 0, 0 |
| 0, 0, 0 |

I hope this solution meets your expectations! Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
