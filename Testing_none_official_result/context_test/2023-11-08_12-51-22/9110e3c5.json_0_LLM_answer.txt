LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The input-output pairs provided are examples of simple geometric transformations such as flipping, rotation, scaling, and translation. The goal is to identify the underlying pattern in these transformations and describe them in a concise manner.

The input grids are 2x2 or 3x3 matrices of integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. Each output grid is obtained by applying some transformation(s) to the corresponding input grid.

After analyzing the input-output pairs, we can observe the following patterns:

* Flipping: Some input-output pairs exhibit horizontal or vertical flipping, where rows or columns are reversed.
* Rotation: A few input-output pairs demonstrate clockwise or counterclockwise rotation by 90 degrees.
* Scaling: One input-output pair shows uniform scaling, where the output grid has twice the number of rows and columns as the input grid.
* Translation: Some input-output pairs display translations, where the output grid is shifted left, right, up, or down relative to the input grid.
* Mirroring: There is one input-output pair that demonstrates mirroring along the main diagonal.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rules:

1. Flip horizontally or vertically when the input grid contains alternating colors.
2. Rotate clockwise or counterclockwise by 90 degrees when there are symmetrical patterns in the input grid.
3. Scale up uniformly when the input grid consists of identical colors in a checkerboard pattern.
4. Translate left, right, up, or down when there are consistent gaps or empty spaces in the input grid.
5. Mirror along the main diagonal when the input grid has a central axis of symmetry.

Now, let's focus on describing the transformations in a more concise manner using mathematical notation. We can express the transformations as functions that take the input grid as an argument and return the transformed output grid. Here are some possible notations:

F(I) = HFlip(I) for horizontal flipping
F(I) = VFlip(I) for vertical flipping
F(I) = R90(I) for clockwise rotation by 90 degrees
F(I) = R(-90)(I) for counterclockwise rotation by 90 degrees
F(I) = Upscale(I) for uniform scaling
F(I) = Translate(I, (a, b)) for translating a units left and b units up
F(I) = MirrorDiagonal(I) for mirroring along the main diagonal

Using these notations, we can now write the instructions for transforming the test input grid:

1. Apply F(I) = HFlip(I)
2. Apply F(I) = R90(I)
3. Apply F(I) = Upscale(I)
4. Apply F(I) = Translate(I, (1, 1))
5. Apply F(I) = MirrorDiagonal(I)

Finally, we can fill in the missing fields in the desired output:

"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid",
"pixel_changes": "There are movements and pattern changes in the pixels",
