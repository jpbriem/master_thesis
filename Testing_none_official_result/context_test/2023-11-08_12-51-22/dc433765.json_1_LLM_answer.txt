LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

This is an example of a JSON file describing a set of input-output pairs for a machine learning model to learn how to perform a specific task. In this case, the task is to recognize patterns in 2D grids of pixels and apply certain transformations to the input grid based on those patterns.

Each input-output pair consists of a train input, which is a 2D grid of pixels represented as a list of lists of integers, and a corresponding train output, which is also a 2D grid of pixels represented as a list of lists of integers. The goal is to learn a mapping from the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples.

In addition to the input and output grids, each example includes additional information about the transformation that should be applied to the input grid to produce the output grid. This information includes:

* reflection: Whether the input grid should be reflected horizontally or vertically before applying the transformation.
* grid_changes: Whether the dimensions of the input grid should be modified (either increased or decreased) before applying the transformation.
* pixel_changes: Whether individual pixels in the input grid should be modified (either changed in place or swapped with neighboring pixels) before applying the transformation.
* object_changes: Whether objects in the input grid (defined as regions of connected pixels with the same value) should be transformed in some way (e.g., moved, resized, rotated, etc.).
* overall_pattern: A brief description of the overall pattern in the input grid that should be recognized and transformed.
* instructions: Detailed steps for applying the transformation to the input grid, including any necessary modifications to the grid itself.
* test_output: The expected output grid that should result from applying the transformation to a test input grid.

The provided examples are just a few instances of input-output pairs that the model should be able to recognize and generalize from. The goal is to develop a model that can take an arbitrary input grid and apply the appropriate transformation based on the patterns and relationships present in the grid, in order to produce the desired output grid.
