The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nYour task is to give an abstract description (valid for all example pairs) about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'grid_view': 'describe the dimensions of all input grids and of all output grids.', 'pixel_view': 'describe the pixels of all input grids and of all output grids, focusing on positions or patterns', 'object_view': 'describe the objects in all input grids and in all output grids, focusing on shape, amount, size, position, values, cell count', 'description': 'summarize your findings in an abstract description, which is valid for all example pairs, of how an input grid and an output grid typically look like'}.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]\n\n\nDescription: The input grids consist of objects of different colors surrounded by the background color 'a', while the output grids rearrange these objects in different patterns while maintaining the same colors.\n\nOverall pattern: The overall pattern involves rearranging the objects in the grid while maintaining the same colors.\n\nChoice 1: 1. Identify the objects of different colors surrounded by the background color 'a'.\n2. Rearrange the identified objects in the desired pattern while maintaining the same colors.\n3. Fill the remaining spaces with the background color 'a'.\nChoice 2: 1. Identify the objects of different colors surrounded by the background color 'a'.\n2. Rearrange these objects in different patterns while maintaining the same colors to match the output grid.\nChoice 3: 1. Identify the objects of different colors surrounded by 'a' in the input grid. \n2. Rearrange the identified objects in the output grid according to the specified pattern while maintaining the same colors. \n3.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output.

For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nBased on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.\nEvaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]\n\n\nDescription: The input grids consist of objects of different colors surrounded by the background color 'a', while the output grids rearrange these objects in different patterns while maintaining the same colors.\n\nOverall pattern: The overall pattern involves rearranging the objects within the grid while preserving their colors, resulting in different spatial arrangements of the colored objects.\n\nInstructions: 1. Identify the distinct objects within the grid based on their colors and the surrounding background color 'a'.\n2. Rearrange the identified objects within the grid to match the spatial pattern seen in the output grid while maintaining their original colors.\n3. Ensure that the background color 'a' remains unchanged during the transformation process.\ntest input:\n[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\n\nChoice 1: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nChoice 2: [[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]\nChoice 3: [['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]\n###########################################################\nVote Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"Choice 1 does not fit the given description, overall pattern, and instructions because it does not rearrange the objects within the grid while preserving their original colors.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"Choice 2 does not fit the given description, overall pattern, and instructions because it does not preserve the original background color 'a' and does not rearrange the objects within the grid as seen in the output examples.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"Choice 3 fits the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it preserves the original background color 'a' and rearranges the objects within the grid while maintaining their original colors.\",\n  \"vote\": 3\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The first given test output does not fit the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it does not rearrange the objects within the grid while maintaining their original colors.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The second given test output fits the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it rearranges the objects within the grid while maintaining their original colors, resulting in different spatial arrangements of the colored objects.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The third given test output does not fit the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it does not rearrange the objects within the grid while maintaining their original colors.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 2\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The first given test output does not fit the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it does not rearrange the objects within the grid while preserving their colors.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The second given test output fits the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it rearranges the objects within the grid while preserving their colors.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The third given test output does not fit the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it does not rearrange the objects within the grid while preserving their colors.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 2\n}\n###########################################################\nVote Values: [0, 2, 0]"

            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nBased on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.\nEvaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}.

Identify all non-'a' colored pixels in the input grid. 2. Group these non-'a' colored pixels to form a connected area. 3. Change the color of this connected area to the dominant color in the output grid.\ntest input:\n[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\n\nChoice 1: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, g, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\nChoice 2: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nChoice 3: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\n###########################################################\nVote Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The first given test output fits the overall pattern and instructions.
