Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nYour task is to give an abstract description (valid for all example pairs) about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'grid_view': 'describe the dimensions of all input grids and of all output grids.', 'pixel_view': 'describe the pixels of all input grids and of all output grids, focusing on positions or patterns', 'object_view': 'describe the objects in all input grids and in all output grids, focusing on shape, amount, size, position, values, cell count', 'description': 'summarize your findings in an abstract description, which is valid for all example pairs, of how an input grid and an output grid typically look like'}.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given multiple abstract descriptions about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nEvaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe the provided training input and output grids.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a], [a, d, e, a], [a, h, g, a], [a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[d, a, a, e], [a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a], [h, a, a, g]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a], [a, f, g, a], [a, i, d, a], [a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[f, a, a, g], [a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a], [i, a, a, d]]\n\n\nChoice 1: The input grids and the output grids typically have a specific arrangement of non-background pixels, with some pixels forming a diagonal line or an 'L' shape. The non-background objects in the grids also exhibit specific rearrangements, with one object forming a diagonal line and two objects forming an 'L' shape.\nChoice 2: The input grids are 4x4 grids with specific colors at certain positions, and the output grids are also 4x4 grids with the same specific colors at different positions, indicating a transformation of the objects within the grids.\nChoice 3: The input grids contain specific color combinations forming certain patterns and shapes, while the output grids have different color combinations forming different patterns and shapes.\n###########################################################\nVote Outputs:\n{\n  \"description_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The input grids and the output grids typically have a specific arrangement of non-background pixels, with some pixels forming a diagonal line or an 'L' shape.

The non-background objects in the grids also exhibit specific rearrangements, with one object forming a diagonal line and two objects forming an 'L' shape.\n\nChoice 1: The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\nChoice 2: The input-output relationship involves rearranging non-background pixels to form specific patterns, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, and rearranging non-background objects to form specific shapes, such as diagonal lines and 'L' shapes.\nChoice 3: The non-background pixels and objects in the input grid undergo specific rearrangements to form diagonal lines or 'L' shapes in the output grid, maintaining the overall arrangement and shape of the objects.\n###########################################################\nVote Outputs:\n{\n  \"overall_pattern_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The input-output relationship involves rearranging non-background pixels to form specific patterns, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, and rearranging non-background objects to form specific shapes, such as diagonal lines and 'L' shapes.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The non-background pixels and objects in the input grid undergo specific rearrangements to form diagonal lines or 'L' shapes in the output grid, maintaining the overall arrangement and shape of the objects.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 2\n}\n------\n{\n  \"overall_pattern_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The input-output relationship involves rearranging non-background pixels to form specific patterns, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, and rearranging non-background objects to form specific shapes, such as diagonal lines and 'L' shapes.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The non-background pixels and objects in the input grid undergo specific rearrangements to form diagonal lines or 'L' shapes in the output grid, maintaining the overall arrangement and shape of the objects.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 2\n}\n------\n{\n  \"overall_pattern_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The input-output relationship involves rearranging non-background pixels to form specific patterns, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, and rearranging non-background objects to form specific shapes, such as diagonal lines and 'L' shapes.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The non-background pixels and objects in the input grid undergo specific rearrangements to form diagonal lines or 'L' shapes in the output grid, maintaining the overall arrangement and shape of the objects.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 2\n}\n###########################################################\nVote Values: [0, 3, 0]"

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background.
