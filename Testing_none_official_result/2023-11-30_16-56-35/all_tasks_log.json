Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nYour task is to give an abstract description (valid for all example pairs) about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'grid_view': 'describe the dimensions of all input grids and of all output grids.', 'pixel_view': 'describe the pixels of all input grids and of all output grids, focusing on positions or patterns', 'object_view': 'describe the objects in all input grids and in all output grids, focusing on shape, amount, size, position, values, cell count', 'description': 'summarize your findings in an abstract description, which is valid for all example pairs, of how an input grid and an output grid typically look like'}.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given multiple abstract descriptions about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nEvaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe the provided training input and output grids.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[e, e, i], [g, e, d], [g, d, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[e, e, e], [e, e, e], [e, e, e]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[g, i, j], [b, i, b], [j, e, j]]\ntrain output:\n[[j, j, j], [j, j, j], [j, j, j]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[e, g, j], [g, e, b], [i, i, g]]\ntrain output:\n[[g, g, g], [g, g, g], [g, g, g]]\n\n\nChoice 1: The input grids consist of multiple objects with various colors and arrangements, while the output grids typically feature a dominant, large object mainly consisting of the color 'e', sometimes surrounded by smaller objects of other colors.\nChoice 2: The input grids typically consist of multiple objects of different colors arranged in specific patterns, while the output grids typically have a single color filling the entire grid, regardless of the specific colors and patterns in the input grids.\nChoice 3: The input grids typically contain multiple distinct objects or shapes based on different colors, while the output grids typically have a single object or shape based on a single color that covers the entire grid.\n###########################################################\nVote Outputs:\n{\n  \"description_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"analyze if the first given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"analyze if the second given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"analyze if the third given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": \"2\"\n}\n------\n{\n  \"description_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"analyze if the first given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"analyze if the second given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"analyze if the third given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": \"2\"\n}\n------\n{\n  \"description_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"analyze if the first given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"analyze if the second given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"analyze if the third given description correctly describes the inputs and outputs of all examples.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": \"2\"\n}\n###########################################################\nVote Values: [0, 3, 0]"

The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.\nEvaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[e, e, i], [g, e, d], [g, d, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[e, e, e], [e, e, e], [e, e, e]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[g, i, j], [b, i, b], [j, e, j]]\ntrain output:\n[[j, j, j], [j, j, j], [j, j, j]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[e, g, j], [g, e, b], [i, i, g]]\ntrain output:\n[[g, g, g], [g, g, g], [g, g, g]]\n\n\nDescription: The input grids consist of multiple objects with various colors and arrangements, while the output grids typically feature a dominant, large object mainly consisting of the color 'e', sometimes surrounded by smaller objects of other colors.\n\nOverall pattern: The main pattern is the transformation of the dominant color in the input grid into a larger 'e' object in the output grid, while other objects are removed or transformed into 'e' objects.\n\nInstructions: 1. Identify the dominant color in the input grid.\n2. Replace all occurrences of the dominant color with 'e'.\n3. If there are smaller objects of different colors, remove or transform them into 'e' objects.\ntest input:\n[[i, i, g], [e, g, j], [i, d, a]]\n\nChoice 1: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\nChoice 2: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\nChoice 3: [['e', 'e', 'e'], ['e', 'e', 'e'], ['e', 'e', 'e']]\n###########################################################\nVote Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The test output grid does not fit the given description, as it does not transform the dominant color 'i' into a larger 'e' object and does not remove or transform smaller objects into 'e' objects.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The test output grid does not fit the given description, as it does not transform the dominant color 'i' into a larger 'e' object and does not remove or transform smaller objects into 'e' objects.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The test output grid fits the given description, as it transforms the dominant color 'i' into a larger 'e' object and removes other objects by replacing them with 'e' objects.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 3\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The potential output grid does not fit the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it does not transform the dominant color 'g' into a larger 'e' object and does not remove or transform smaller objects into 'e' objects.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The potential output grid does not fit the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it does not transform the dominant color 'g' into a larger 'e' object and does not remove or transform smaller objects into 'e' objects.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The potential output grid fits the given description, overall pattern, and instructions as it transforms the dominant color 'g' into a larger 'e' object and removes the smaller objects by transforming them into 'e' objects.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 3\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The output grid does not fit the description, as it does not transform the dominant color 'i' into a larger 'e' object and does not remove smaller objects.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The output grid does not fit the description, as it does not transform the dominant color 'i' into a larger 'e' object and does not remove smaller objects.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The output grid fits the description, as it transforms the dominant color 'i' into a larger 'e' object and removes smaller objects to create a grid mainly consisting of the color 'e'.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 3\n}\n###########################################################\nVote Values: [0, 0, 3]"

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background.

The non-background objects in the grids also exhibit specific rearrangements, with one object forming a diagonal line and two objects forming an 'L' shape.\n\nChoice 1: The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\nChoice 2: The input-output relationship involves rearranging non-background pixels to form specific patterns, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, and rearranging non-background objects to form specific shapes, such as diagonal lines and 'L' shapes.\nChoice 3: The non-background pixels and objects in the input grid undergo specific rearrangements to form diagonal lines or 'L' shapes in the output grid, maintaining the overall arrangement and shape of the objects.\n###########################################################\nVote Outputs:\n{\n  \"overall_pattern_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The input-output relationship involves rearranging non-background pixels to form specific patterns, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, and rearranging non-background objects to form specific shapes, such as diagonal lines and 'L' shapes.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The non-background pixels and objects in the input grid undergo specific rearrangements to form diagonal lines or 'L' shapes in the output grid, maintaining the overall arrangement and shape of the objects.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 2\n}\n------\n{\n  \"overall_pattern_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The input-output relationship involves rearranging non-background pixels to form specific patterns, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, and rearranging non-background objects to form specific shapes, such as diagonal lines and 'L' shapes.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The non-background pixels and objects in the input grid undergo specific rearrangements to form diagonal lines or 'L' shapes in the output grid, maintaining the overall arrangement and shape of the objects.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 2\n}\n------\n{\n  \"overall_pattern_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\",\n    \"Choice_2\": \"The input-output relationship involves rearranging non-background pixels to form specific patterns, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, and rearranging non-background objects to form specific shapes, such as diagonal lines and 'L' shapes.\",\n    \"Choice_3\": \"The non-background pixels and objects in the input grid undergo specific rearrangements to form diagonal lines or 'L' shapes in the output grid, maintaining the overall arrangement and shape of the objects.\"\n  },\n  \"vote\": 2\n}\n###########################################################\nVote Values: [0, 3, 0]"

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nBased on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

The non-background objects in the grids also exhibit specific rearrangements, with one object forming a diagonal line and two objects forming an 'L' shape.\n\nOverall pattern: The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\n\nInstructions: Step 1: Identify the non-background pixels forming diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the input grid.\nStep 2: Rearrange the non-background pixels to form the specific geometric shapes (diagonal lines and 'L' shapes) as seen in the output grid.\nStep 3: Ensure that the rearrangement results in the same geometric shapes (diagonal lines and 'L' shapes) in the output grid as observed in the input-output pairs.\ntest input:\n[[a, a, a, a], [a, c, d, a], [a, e, j, a], [a, a, a, a]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"description\": \"The test input consists of a 4x4 grid with non-background pixels arranged in a specific manner, similar to the input-output pairs.

For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.\nEvaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a], [a, d, e, a], [a, h, g, a], [a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[d, a, a, e], [a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a], [h, a, a, g]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a], [a, f, g, a], [a, i, d, a], [a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[f, a, a, g], [a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a], [i, a, a, d]]\n\n\nDescription: The input grids and the output grids typically have a specific arrangement of non-background pixels, with some pixels forming a diagonal line or an 'L' shape. The non-background objects in the grids also exhibit specific rearrangements, with one object forming a diagonal line and two objects forming an 'L' shape.\n\nOverall pattern: The overall pattern involves rearranging the non-background pixels and objects to form specific geometric shapes like diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the output grid.\n\nInstructions: Step 1: Identify the non-background pixels forming diagonal lines and 'L' shapes in the input grid.\nStep 2: Rearrange the non-background pixels to form the specific geometric shapes (diagonal lines and 'L' shapes) as seen in the output grid.\nStep 3: Ensure that the rearrangement results in the same geometric shapes (diagonal lines and 'L' shapes) in the output grid as observed in the input-output pairs.\ntest input:\n[[a, a, a, a], [a, c, d, a], [a, e, j, a], [a, a, a, a]]\n\nChoice 1: [[-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 1, 2, -1], [-1, 3, 4, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1]]\nChoice 2: [[1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 4]]\nChoice 3: [[c, a, a, d], [a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a], [e, a, a, j]]\n###########################################################\nVote Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"Choice 1 fits the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.

                "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nBased on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.\nEvaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nBased on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

Identify the non-background colored pixels in the input grid. \n2. Connect these non-background colored pixels to form a single connected area. \n3. Change the connected area to the dominant color (c or d) in the output grid. \n4.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.\nEvaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}.

Identify the non-background colored pixels in the input grid. \n2. Connect these non-background colored pixels to form a single connected area. \n3.

Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nBased on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.\nEvaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]\n\n\nDescription: The input grids typically consist of mostly background color 'a' with isolated non-'a' colored pixels, while the output grids typically have a connected area of dominant color 'c' or 'd' with some non-dominant colored pixels.\n\nOverall pattern: The non-'a' colored pixels in the input grids are typically moved to form a connected area of a dominant color in the output grids, resulting in an increase in the number of dominant colored objects.\n\nInstructions: 1. Identify the non-'a' colored pixels in the input grid.\n2. Connect these non-'a' colored pixels to form a connected area of dominant color in the output grid. This can be achieved by extending the non-'a' colored pixels to neighboring 'a' colored pixels to create a connected area.\n3. Fill the connected area with the dominant color (c or d) in the output grid.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each non-'a' colored pixel in the input grid.\ntest input:\n[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\n\nChoice 1: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nChoice 2: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\nChoice 3: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]\n###########################################################\nVote Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": {\n    \"Choice_1\": \"The test output fits the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nBased on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.\nEvaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}.
