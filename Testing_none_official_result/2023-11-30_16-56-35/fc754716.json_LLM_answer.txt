prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Your task is to give an abstract description (valid for all example pairs) about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'grid_view': 'describe the dimensions of all input grids and of all output grids.', 'pixel_view': 'describe the pixels of all input grids and of all output grids, focusing on positions or patterns', 'object_view': 'describe the objects in all input grids and in all output grids, focusing on shape, amount, size, position, values, cell count', 'description': 'summarize your findings in an abstract description, which is valid for all example pairs, of how an input grid and an output grid typically look like'}.

Vote Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given multiple overall patterns that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Evaluate the given patterns and analyze if they correctly describe the relation between all input and output pairs.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Based on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Based on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Your task is to give step-by-step instructions that are general applicable to all input examples to create their outputs.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'part_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation, describe the parts of interest of the input grid, e.g. the grid dimension, pixel pattern, or objects', 'conditions': 'describe if and how the transformation process is based on conditions, e.g. object characteristics (number, shape, symmetry, color, size, position) or pixel characteristics (color, position)', 'instructions': 'describe the generally needed transformation actions step by step to transform an input grid into its output grid'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Based on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]


Description: The input grids consist of objects of different colors surrounded by the background color 'a', while the output grids rearrange these objects in different patterns while maintaining the same colors.

Overall pattern: The overall pattern involves rearranging the objects within the grid while preserving their colors, resulting in different spatial arrangements of the colored objects.

Instructions: 1. Identify the distinct objects within the grid based on their colors and the surrounding background color 'a'.
2. Rearrange the identified objects within the grid to match the spatial pattern seen in the output grid while maintaining their original colors.
3. Ensure that the background color 'a' remains unchanged during the transformation process.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Based on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]


Description: The input grids consist of objects of different colors surrounded by the background color 'a', while the output grids rearrange these objects in different patterns while maintaining the same colors.

Overall pattern: The overall pattern involves rearranging the objects within the grid while preserving their colors, resulting in different spatial arrangements of the colored objects.

Instructions: 1. Identify all the unique colors present in the input grid.
2. For each unique color, find its position and the positions of its surrounding 'a' pixels.
3. Based on the overall pattern, rearrange the objects within the grid while preserving their colors, according to the specific spatial arrangement observed in the output grid.
test input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]

You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process

Description: The input grids consist of objects of different colors surrounded by the background color 'a', while the output grids rearrange these objects in different patterns while maintaining the same colors.

Overall pattern: The overall pattern involves rearranging the objects within the grid while preserving their colors, resulting in different spatial arrangements of the colored objects.

Instructions: 1. Identify all the unique colors present in the input grid.
2. For each unique color, find its position and the positions of its surrounding 'a' pixels.
3. Based on the overall pattern, rearrange the objects within the grid while preserving their colors, according to the specific spatial arrangement observed in the output grid.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Your task is to give step-by-step instructions that are general applicable to all input examples to create their outputs.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'part_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation, describe the parts of interest of the input grid, e.g. the grid dimension, pixel pattern, or objects', 'conditions': 'describe if and how the transformation process is based on conditions, e.g. object characteristics (number, shape, symmetry, color, size, position) or pixel characteristics (color, position)', 'instructions': 'describe the generally needed transformation actions step by step to transform an input grid into its output grid'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]


Description: The input grids typically consist of mostly background color 'a' with isolated non-'a' colored pixels, while the output grids typically have a connected area of dominant color 'c' or 'd' with some non-dominant colored pixels.

Overall pattern: The non-background colored pixels in the input move to form a single connected area of dominant color in the output, while the background color remains unchanged.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Based on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]


Description: The input grids typically consist of mostly background color 'a' with isolated non-'a' colored pixels, while the output grids typically have a connected area of dominant color 'c' or 'd' with some non-dominant colored pixels.

Overall pattern: The non-background colored pixels in the input move to form a single connected area of dominant color in the output, while the background color remains unchanged.

Instructions: 1. Identify the non-background colored pixels in the input grid. 
2. Connect these non-background colored pixels to form a single connected area. 
3. Change the connected area to the dominant color (c or d) in the output grid. 
4. Leave the background color unchanged in the output grid.
test input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.
Evaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]


Description: The input grids typically consist of mostly background color 'a' with isolated non-'a' colored pixels, while the output grids typically have a connected area of dominant color 'c' or 'd' with some non-dominant colored pixels.

Overall pattern: The non-background colored pixels in the input move to form a single connected area of dominant color in the output, while the background color remains unchanged.

Instructions: 1. Identify the non-background colored pixels in the input grid. 
2. Connect these non-background colored pixels to form a single connected area. 
3. Change the connected area to the dominant color (c or d) in the output grid. 
4. Leave the background color unchanged in the output grid.
test input:

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Based on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

Description: The input grids typically consist of mostly background color 'a' with isolated non-'a' colored pixels, while the output grids typically have a connected area of dominant color 'c' or 'd' with some non-dominant colored pixels.

Overall pattern: The non-background colored pixels in the input move to form a single connected area of dominant color in the output, while the background color remains unchanged.

Instructions: 1. Identify the dominant color in the input grid.
2. Find the connected area of non-background colored pixels of the dominant color.
3. Replace all non-background colored pixels in the connected area with the dominant color.
4. Keep the background color unchanged.
5. The connected area should now form a single connected area of dominant color in the output grid.

Vote Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.
Evaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Your task is to give step-by-step instructions that are general applicable to all input examples to create their outputs.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'part_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation, describe the parts of interest of the input grid, e.g. the grid dimension, pixel pattern, or objects', 'conditions': 'describe if and how the transformation process is based on conditions, e.g. object characteristics (number, shape, symmetry, color, size, position) or pixel characteristics (color, position)', 'instructions': 'describe the generally needed transformation actions step by step to transform an input grid into its output grid'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Description: The input grids typically consist of mostly background color 'a' with isolated non-'a' colored pixels, while the output grids typically have a connected area of dominant color 'c' or 'd' with some non-dominant colored pixels.

Overall pattern: The non-'a' colored pixels in the input grids are typically moved to form a connected area of a dominant color in the output grids, resulting in an increase in the number of dominant colored objects.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Based on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]

Example:

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]


Description: The input grids typically consist of mostly background color 'a' with isolated non-'a' colored pixels, while the output grids typically have a connected area of dominant color 'c' or 'd' with some non-dominant colored pixels.

Overall pattern: The non-'a' colored pixels in the input grids are typically moved to form a connected area of a dominant color in the output grids, resulting in an increase in the number of dominant colored objects.

Instructions: 1. Identify the non-'a' colored pixels in the input grid.
2. Connect these non-'a' colored pixels to form a connected area of dominant color in the output grid. This can be achieved by extending the non-'a' colored pixels to neighboring 'a' colored pixels to create a connected area.
3. Fill the connected area with the dominant color (c or d) in the output grid.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each non-'a' colored pixel in the input grid.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Based on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]


Description: The input grids typically consist of mostly background color 'a' with isolated non-'a' colored pixels, while the output grids typically have a connected area of dominant color 'c' or 'd' with some non-dominant colored pixels.

Overall pattern: The non-'a' colored pixels in the input grids are typically moved to form a connected area of a dominant color in the output grids, resulting in an increase in the number of dominant colored objects.

Instructions: 1. Identify all non-'a' colored pixels in the input grid. 2. Group these non-'a' colored pixels to form a connected area. 3. Change the color of this connected area to the dominant color in the output grid.
test input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]

Vote Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.
Evaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, c, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[c, c, c], [c, a, c], [c, c, c]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, d, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
train output:
[[d, d, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, a, d], [d, d, d]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]

[[b, b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, a, a, a, a, a, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b, b]]

Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a]]
train output:
[[g, g, g, g, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, a, a, a, g], [g, g, g, g, g]]


Description: The input grids typically consist of mostly background color 'a' with isolated non-'a' colored pixels, while the output grids typically have a connected area of dominant color 'c' or 'd' with some non-dominant colored pixels.

Overall pattern: The non-'a' colored pixels in the input grids are typically moved to form a connected area of a dominant color in the output grids, resulting in an increase in the number of dominant colored objects.

Instructions: 1. Identify all non-'a' colored pixels in the input grid. 2. Group these non-'a' colored pixels to form a connected area. 3. Change the color of this connected area to the dominant color in the output grid.
test input:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]

Choice 1: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, g, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
