prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.

Vote Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given multiple sets of instructions that might be general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Evaluate the given sets of instructions and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all input and output examples.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'instruction_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given instruction correctly describes the transformation from input to output for all examples.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.

prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Your task is to give step-by-step instructions that are general applicable to all input examples to create their outputs.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'part_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation, describe the parts of interest of the input grid, e.g. the grid dimension, pixel pattern, or objects', 'conditions': 'describe if and how the transformation process is based on conditions, e.g. object characteristics (number, shape, symmetry, color, size, position) or pixel characteristics (color, position)', 'instructions': 'describe the generally needed transformation actions step by step to transform an input grid into its output grid'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Description: The input grids and the output grids typically have a specific arrangement of non-background pixels, with some pixels forming a diagonal line or an 'L' shape. The non-background objects in the grids also exhibit specific rearrangements, with one object forming a diagonal line and two objects forming an 'L' shape.

Overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves rearranging non-background pixels to form specific patterns, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, and rearranging non-background objects to form specific shapes, such as diagonal lines and 'L' shapes.

Instructions: 1. Identify the non-background pixels and objects in the input grid. 2. Rearrange the non-background pixels and objects to form specific patterns and shapes, such as diagonal lines or 'L' shapes, as seen in the output grid. 3. Ensure the rearrangement follows the specific arrangement and rearrangement of non-background pixels and objects observed in the overall pattern.

Vote Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.

You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.

Vote Prompt:
You are given a series of input and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.
Moreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.
Evaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


Example:
train input:
[[a, a, a, a], [a, d, e, a], [a, h, g, a], [a, a, a, a]]
