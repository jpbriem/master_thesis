Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nBased on the provided information, your task is to apply the general instructions to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'description': 'describe the test input and check if it fits to the given abstract description', 'intermediate_results': 'apply the instructions step by step to the test input grid with all intermediate grids', 'test_output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[e, e, i], [g, e, d], [g, d, a]]\ntrain output:\n[[e, e, e], [e, e, e], [e, e, e]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[g, i, j], [b, i, b], [j, e, j]]\ntrain output:\n[[j, j, j], [j, j, j], [j, j, j]]\n\nExample:\ntrain input:\n[[e, g, j], [g, e, b], [i, i, g]]\ntrain output:\n[[g, g, g], [g, g, g], [g, g, g]]\n\n\nDescription: The input grids consist of multiple objects with various colors and arrangements, while the output grids typically feature a dominant, large object mainly consisting of the color 'e', sometimes surrounded by smaller objects of other colors.\n\nOverall pattern: The main pattern is the transformation of the dominant color in the input grid into a larger 'e' object in the output grid, while other objects are removed or transformed into 'e' objects.\n\nInstructions: 1. Identify the dominant color in the input grid.\n2. Replace all occurrences of the dominant color with 'e'.\n3.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.\n\nYou can refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an abstract description about how an input grid and an output grid typically look like.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that might describe the relation between all input and output pairs.\nMoreover, you are given step by step instructions that are general applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and multiple potential test output grids.\nEvaluate the given test output grids and analyze if they fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\n\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': {'Choice_1': 'analyze if the first given test output fit to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.', 'Choice_2': '...'}, 'vote': 'vote for the best choice by entering the number of the choice as integer'}.
