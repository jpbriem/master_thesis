## Answer (2)

You can use `np.where()` to find the indices where your condition is true and then you can use those indices to index into your array.

For example, if we have an array `a = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])`, we could get all the rows with a value greater than 2 by using `np.where(a > 2)`. This will return a tuple containing two arrays, one for each dimension. The first array contains the row indices that satisfy our condition, while the second array contains the column indices that satisfy our condition. In this case, it would be `(array([0]), array([0]))`. We can then use these indices to access the elements in our original array. For example, we could get the values at the positions specified by the indices returned by `np.where(a > 2)` by doing `a[np.where(a > 2)]`. This would give us `[[3]]`.

In your case, you want to find the rows where the sum of the elements is less than or equal to 5. You can do this by using `np.sum(..., axis=1) <= 5`. Then, you can use `np.where()` to get the indices of the rows that satisfy this condition. Finally, you can use these indices to index into your array.

Here's how you could implement this:

```
import numpy as np

# Create some data
data = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(6, 3))
print("Data:\n", data)

# Find the rows where the sum of the elements is less than or equal to 5
indices = np.where(np.sum(data, axis=1) <= 5)[0]
print("\nIndices:\n", indices)

# Get the corresponding rows from the data array
rows = data[indices]
print("\nRows:\n", rows)
```

This should print out something like the following:

```
Data:
 [[7 8  9]
 [1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8  9]
 [1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

Indices:
 [0 2 3 4 5]

Rows:
 [[7 8  9]
 [4 5 6]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8  9]
 [1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
```
